<dc:description xml:lang="en">From June 1987 to June 1990, the musculoskeletal system tissues bank of the Orthopaedics and Traumatology Department of the University Clinic of Navarra has used 310 allografts. Of this, 219 has been used in our Department, 142 of cancellous bone and 42 of cortical bone. 24 of patellar tendon and 11 of fascia lata. The other 91 grafts have been sent to other hospitals in the country. In the present work we make a retrospective study that included the patients who were operate with allograft. We observe the differences between several types of allografts comparing them with conventional surgery technics. Within the complications we distinguished a 10.52% of infection in cortical bone allografts used in patients with neoplastic treatment. In the other type of allograft we didn't present this complication. We concluded that a bone bank or a musculoskeletal system tissues bank has a great usefulness in different reconstructive surgery technics and arthrodesis. They are used more frequent in orthopaedics and traumatology surgery improving the development of this surgery.</dc:description>
