<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the results obtained in the correction of the curved penis by means of Nesbit's technique during the four first years of integration of our Service in the Major Ambulatory Surgery Unit (CMA) of our Hospital. PATIENTS AND METHOD From January of 2000 to April of 2004 we intervened in ambulatory regime 21 patient suffering from curved penis (12 congenital and 9 with Peyronie's disease) by means of Nesbit's technique. The surgical-anesthetic performed procedure is described and also the criteria of inclusion and discharge are evaluated, as well as the results obtained and the degree of satisfaction by means of the elaboration of a questionnaire. RESULTS None of the patients needed entrance for intrasurgery nor postsurgery complications. Thus, we obtained a null incidence of complications with the exception of the inevitable shortening of the penis, clearly independent from the regime of out-patient's process. The degree of satisfaction with the received treatment has been superior to 95%. CONCLUSIONS The practical totality of the susceptible patients for surgical correction of penile curvature are candidates to be included in a CMA program, improving obviously the relation cost-efficacy, not diminishing for that reason the welfare quality nor the degree of patient's satisfaction.</dc:description>
