<dc:description xml:lang="en">Poland's syndrome is considered to be a polimalformative entity with different degrees of severity. We retrospectively reviewed our patients with Poland's syndrome diagnosis, treated between 2000 and 2006. The aim of our study is to assess the different choices of surgical treatment for mammary reconstruction according to the importance of malformation and taking into account our own experience and literature references. A total o f 13 patients (5 males and 8 females) were studied and only 6 of them (1 male and 5 females) underwent surgery. Surgical indication was based on Foucras's classification, considering 3 grades of severity. We propose a surgical approach adapted to each stage, as well as surgical refinements to improve the aesthetic aspect. Most of our patients were very satisfied with final results even though they underwent complex procedures with a considerable rate of complications.</dc:description>
