<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The activity of the deaminase adenosine enzyme (ADA) has principally been related with the functionalism and replication of the T lymphocytes. Its serum behavior and possible clinical use in infection by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was studied. METHODS A multicenter study in which the serum values of ADA were examined and compared with those of two reference markers (CD4+ lymphocytes and beta 2-microglobulin) in 35 presumably healthy donors used as controls, in 60 intravenous drug users (IVDU) seronegative for HIV-1, in 69 HIV-1 asymptomatic seropositive intravenous drug users (HIV-1+) and in 48 patients with AIDS. RESULTS The serum values of ADA were as follows: control group 10.9 +/- 4.2 U/I; IVDU group 17.6 +/- 7.4 U/I; asymptomatic HIV-1+ group 32.7 +/- 10.2 U/I, AIDS group 46.2 +/- 18.2 U/I. Differences between the different groups were statistically significant in themselves and in relation to the control group. A negative correlation was observed (r = 0.47, p &lt; 0.01) with the number of CD4+ lymphocytes and a positive correlation was found with respect to beta 2-microglobulin (r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001). The values of serum ADA activity in patients with AIDS and tuberculosis (47.4 +/- 17.2 U/I) were not significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) to those of patients with AIDS without this second infection (45.9 +/- 19.3 U/I). CONCLUSIONS Serum deaminase adenosine may be a useful evolutive marker for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 given that its activity increases significantly in infected patients in agreement with the grade of immunodeficiency and its values correlate well with those of reference markers (CD4+ lymphocytes and beta 2-microglobulin).</dc:description>
