<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUNDS AND OBJECTIVE Lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue are special because of their indolent course. Low-grade early-stage tumors resolve after Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication in a high percentage of cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate this regression in our patients with EI1 stage-low-grade B gastric lymphomas after eradication therapy since the introduction of echoendoscopic examinations in the Gastroenterology Department of 'Juan Canalejo' Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study of all cases of low-grade MALT gastric lymphomas in EI1 stage, diagnosed by histological and echoendoscopic examination, from June 1997 to December 2001. After eradication of HP with triple therapy, patients have been followed-up with endoscopic examinations at 2, 3 and 6 months, and yearly afterwards. RESULTS There were 14 patients in this period with low-grade EI1 stage gastric MALT B cell lymphoma. The median age was 65 years, and 57% were females. HP was eradicated in all cases with first- or second-line (2 patients) antibiotic treatment. Complete remission was observed in 10 patients (71.4%) in a median time of 4.5 months. The other 4 patients needed chemotherapy because of non-remission or early relapse, and also as initial treatment. Complete remission was also obtained in these patients. Only 9 patients have been followed up in our unit for a median time of 20 months, period after which all remain free of disease. CONCLUSIONS Low-grade early-stage MALT gastric B-cell lymphomas have a high rate of response to HP eradication therapy. Echoendoscopic staging helps in distinguishing the group of patients who will benefit from conservative treatment. These patients must be followed up as it remains unclear whether remission is maintained in the long term, and to know what factors could be associated with lymphoma relapse.</dc:description>
