<dc:description xml:lang="en">Collagen type 1 represents more than 90% of bone matrix. Therefore, quantitation of collagen crosslinks, such as deoxypyridinoline, can provide information on bone resorption degree. An evaluation was made of deoxypyridinoline as well as other bone markets, such as alkaline phosphatase, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, and hydroxyproline in patients with the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Paget's disease, hyperthyroidism, and chronic renal failure on haemodialysis or not. Deoxypyridinoline levels were significantly increased in patients with osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and hyperthyroidism. Hydroxyproline levels were increased in patients with Paget's disease, and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase was increased in all the entities studied. Deoxypyridinoline can be a more sensitive marker than hydroxyproline, with some advantages, such as its quantitation in a urine specimen and its high bone specificity. In patients with renal failure, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase was the only biochemical marker of bone resorption with increased levels.</dc:description>
