<dc:description xml:lang="en">The use of biological treatments in the field of Dermatology has been recent and priority focus has been given to the treatment of psoriasis. Etanercept has demonstrated its efficacy and safety in this field although it is true that it has been used in many different diseases other than psoriasis with variable results due to its action mechanism and safety profile. We present a case of Hallopeau's Acrodermatitis treated with etanercept with good results. Given the characteristics of chronicity, progressiveness and, in general, poor response to conventional treatments, the use of etanercept is of help in the therapeutic possibilities of Hallopeau's Acrodermatitis. In addition, other possible indications of etanercept in conditions other than Psoriasis are reviewed</dc:description>
