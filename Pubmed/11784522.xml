<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES An important limitation of the ablation with standard catheter is the volume and limited depth of the lesions created. The irrigated catheters, due to a larger and deeper lesion could be useful in patients with typical atrial flutter. The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the ablation procedure with an irrigated-tip catheter versus the standard catheter in this group of patients. METHODS A total of 37 consecutive patients referred to ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus for typical atrial flutter were randomized either to be performed by an standard catheter (20 patients with mean age of 62 18 years, 18 males) or an irrigated-tip catheter (17 patients with mean age 71 4 years, 13 males). RESULTS With standard catheters, complete ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus was achieved in 18 patients (90%). With a mean of 19 15 applications. With the irrigated-tip catheters the complete ablation of the isthmus was achieved with a mean of 8 7 applications (p &lt; 0.001). Both mean duration of the procedure (164 56 versus 70 35 minutes) and fluoroscopic time (40 16 versus 16 8 minutes) was significantly less with irrigated catheters (p &lt; 0.001). There were no significant clinical complications during the procedure nor later on. No patient presented ischemic symptoms nor alterations on the ST segment. CONCLUSIONS The employment of irrigated-tip catheters achieved a high success rate with safety shortening the procedure time and radiation exposure.</dc:description>
