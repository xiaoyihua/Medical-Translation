<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the event of ulcers with critical colonization, a correct diagnosis and adequate treatment are vital for healing to occur since the presence of a possible infection would impede an adequate evolution leading to healing the ulcer The authors publish a prospective and multi-centric study which included 375 patients who were evaluated regarding the healing of their ulcers over a 12 week period in which the "Biatain Plata" dressing was used. The average initial size of their ulcers was 30 cm2 +/- 67. After 72 weeks of treatment, patients' ulcers were reduced by 80% in relative value. 33% of these ulcers showed a complete healing, while another 47.4% evidenced a noticeable improvement. The product studied proved to be highly effective in the treatment of chronic ulcers with critical colonization. Regarding the safety of this dressing, the authors did not observe any adverse reaction to it, nor did they observe any toxicity associated with the release of silver, in spite of having used this dressing over 12 weeks. In the same way, the authors did not notice any indications of possible development of bacterial resistance to the dressing's anti-bacterial action.</dc:description>
