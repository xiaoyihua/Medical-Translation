<dc:description xml:lang="en">Woman of 63 years old with essential arterial hypertensión, essential trembling and chronic venous insufficiency of inferior members; she came to the Internal Medicine outpatients department because of her chronic venous insufficiency, objectifying in the physical examination a systolic heart murmur II/VI in the left sternal border and many signs of chronic venous insufficiency in the inferior members. In the chest radiograph was found as an accidental finding, a properly delimited vascular image in the left upper mediastino, for this reason there were later realized diverse complementary examinations gradually more aggressive, that included a pulmonary angiography which revealed the presence of an aneurysmatic dilatation in the common and left pulmonary arteries. With these findings, the patient was undergoing a surgical operation, in which was realized a partial resection and folder to the common and left pulmonary arteries to reduce diameter to 2-3 centimetres, with a post-operative period without complications and staying without symptoms after the surgery.</dc:description>
