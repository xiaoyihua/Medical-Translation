<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Despite the advances made to explain the aetiopathogenesis of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), there are a number of conflicting opinions as regards its behaviour. AIM. To analyse the controversial issues regarding the clinical-epidemiological behaviour of GBS. DEVELOPMENT We highlight the variety of opinions concerning the characterisation of GBS. We also analyse the possible causes of the regularities and irregularities in its behaviour. We believe the irregularities may be determined by environmental and genetic factors. Among the environmental factors, we consider the most important to be the variability of the previous phenomenon. There are genetically determined factors that can make some individuals more susceptible and others more vulnerable to developing GBS. We discuss the reasons that, in our view, hinder epidemiological processing using traditional statistical methods. CONCLUSIONS GBS is a condition that behaves in a very particular manner. It displays very interesting regularities and irregularities that may be determined by the influence of environmental and genetic factors. The low incidence of the condition is a hindrance when it comes to processing epidemiological data with traditional statistical methods, which are ineffective for characterising the behaviour of the syndrome. Tools therefore need to be developed that make it possible to better study the dynamics of the syndrome and help to explain the mechanisms involved in its causality.</dc:description>
