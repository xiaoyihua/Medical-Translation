<dc:title xml:lang="en">Combined radiochemotherapy in localised small-cell lung cancer. Concurrent treatment protocols?</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Purpose. We retrospectively reviewed our Institution's database to investigate the outcome and impact of combined radiochemotherapy (RT/CT; concomitant or in sequence) in localised small-cell lung cancer (L-SCLC). Material and methods. Between January 1995 to November 1999, 79 patients with L-SCLC received combined RT/CT at our Institution. RT was delivered concurrently or sequentially following the CT. Patients with treatment response received additional prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Results. Of the patients treated, 54% had received concurrent CT/RT compared to 46% receiving RT following the CT. PCI was administered to 80% of the patients. Complete response was observed in 66% of patients. With a median follow up of 30 months, median overall survival was 15.9 months; 14.3 months for patients who received RT following CT and 21.6 months for those receiving concurrent CT/RT. The type of schedule of combined radiochemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for survival free of local recurrence, as was additional PCI for distant metastasis-free survival. Conclusions. Our results are similar to those reported previously in the literature. The main point of interest is that our patients were non-selected. We strongly support the use of concurrent CT/RT so as to achieve results comparable to the best in the literature</dc:description>
