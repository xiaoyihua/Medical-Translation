<dc:description xml:lang="en">An investigation undertaken into a sample of 1,115 five-year old children attending kindergartens in the city of C칩rdoba (Argentina) is described. The investigation aimed at establishing the prevalence and distribution of dental caries by socioeconomic level. Research showed that the prevalence of caries had decreased 55.0% in relation to the 1973 figure, while the proportion of children with healthy teeth was 26.7% greater. The frequency and seriousness of the caries increased as the child's social position declined. At the highest socioeconomic level NES I = entrepreneurial and managerial bourgeoisie), the rates of caries were significantly lower than those at the lowest socioeconomic level (NES III = typical proletariat, nontypical proletariat and sub-proletariat) presenting dmf-t of 0.8 and 2.7, and dmf-s of 0.9 and 4.9, respectively. In NES III, the dmf-t main components were decayed and missing teeth, while in NES I filled teeth were the main components. The proportion of children with no experience of caries was 63.1% in NES I and 11.5% in NES III. Inversly, the rate dental health was higher in NES I (8.8) than in NES III (5.1). The cost per child required for the restorative treatment in approximately two and a half times greater in NES III than in NES I. Considering the sample as a whole the expenditure required for NES III would be more than ten times higher than that required for NES I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
