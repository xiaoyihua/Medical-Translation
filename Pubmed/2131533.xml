<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report preliminary results from a national protocol for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 44 patients, 15 females and 29 males with age range 15 to 65 years (median 27) were treated and followed for 22 months. Complete remission was observed in 33 (77%) of 43 patients with a known induction result. Remission was 100%, 86% and 61% for low (3), medium or high risk patients (p = 0.03). Complete remission occurred more often in patients with WBC less than 35,000 or granulocyte counts greater than 100. Actuarial survival rate at 22 months was 60% overall and 100%, 64% and 50% for the low, intermediate and high risk groups, respectively (NS). Death occurred in 16 patients, 5 during induction, 3 during complete remission, 6 during relapse and 2 after induction failure. Infections were the main cause of death in all groups.</dc:description>
