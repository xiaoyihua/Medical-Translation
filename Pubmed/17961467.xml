<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the needs of the main caregivers of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) recipients during admission to the Coronary Unit of the Virgin Macarena Hospital and after discharge. METHOD A qualitative descriptive study was performed. Semi-structured and open interviews were carried out. Content analysis of the interviews was performed following Giorgi's method (1997). RESULTS Twelve subjects participated. Notable findings during the hospitalization phase were poor communication between caregivers and nurses, the lack of caregivers' participation in providing care, and their difficulties to assimilate the information about ICD therapy. After hospital discharge, the first days at home were marked by fear and the need to overprotect the patient. Subsequent monitoring at the heart rhythm unit improved the process of adjustment to the new situation and confidence in the ICD. CONCLUSIONS Families' needs for information and emotional support should be included in patients' care plans. Moreover, nurses should participate in the process of providing information about ICDs and their possible complications. This would allow personalized information to be progressively given and would help in preparation for discharge and adjustment to the new situation. The length of visiting hours should be modified according to the patient's and family's circumstances. Strategies aimed at improving communication between nurses and caregivers should be introduced.</dc:description>
