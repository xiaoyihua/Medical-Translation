<dc:title xml:lang="en">Alcohol consumption and smoking: relationship to leisure-time physical inactivity and sedentary behavior</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective. To analyze the relationship between exposure to alcohol consumption and smoking to leisure&amp;#8208;time physical inactivity (LTPI) and sedentary behavior (SB) in adolescents. Method. This cross&amp;#8208;sectional study included a representative sample of high school students from public schools in Pernambuco State (Brazil) (n = 4207, 14&amp;#8208;19 years). The data were collected using a previously validated questionnaire. The time spent watching television was used as a measure of sedentary behavior on weekdays (WKDSB) and weekend (WKESB) (&gt; 2 hours/day = exposed to sedentary behavior). The lack of physical activity in free time was considered as leisure&amp;#8208;time physical inactivity (LTPI). Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the association between variables, considering the results of LTPI and SB. Results. The prevalence found were INL = 38.2% (Confidence interval (CI) 95%: 36.7 &amp;#8208; 39.7), CSS = 40.8% (CI 95%: 39.3 &amp;#8208; 42.3) and CFS = 49.9% (CI 95%: 48.4 &amp;#8208; 51.4). After adjustment (demographic, socioeconomic and school factors), exposure to smoking and alcohol consumption were inversely associated with LTPI. The adolescents who consumed alcohol had 27% less chance of LTPI compared to those who did not consumed alcohol. Similarly, smoker students had 28% less chance of LTPI than those who did not smoke. Regarding SB, it was found that smoker students had 28% less chance of exposure to WKESB. Conclusion. It was concluded that consumption of alcoholic beverages and smoking are inversely associated with the LTPI and WKESB, confirming findings already reported in the literature in adult studies (AU)</dc:description>
