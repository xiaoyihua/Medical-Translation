<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The purpose of this paper is to present the experience of the hospital using the Ponseti method in patients with congenital adduct clubfoot. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was conducted between January 2007 and December 2009. Children of both sexes were included; the Dimeglio classification was applied before surgery and their course was later assessed with the Simons scale when they resumed gait. Patients with postural clubfoot (Dimeglio I) and those with neuromuscular disease (Dimeglio IV) were excluded. Casts were placed as of 15 days of age using the Ponseti technique and then percutaneous tenotomy of the calcaneous tendon was performed in the operating room. RESULTS Twenty patients (9 girls, 11 boys) and 28 feet were included in the study; they were Dimeglio II (8 children) and III (12 children). Mean age at the time of surgery was 2 months, and mean age at the time of gait assessment was 2 years. Upon applying the Simons scale, 25 feet (89.3%) had satisfactory results and 3 feet (10.7%) unsatisfactory results. Two of the latter underwent percutaneous tenotomy again and in one case the cast was applied again; they evolved properly. CONCLUSIONS We found in our series that the Ponseti technique is appropriate as definitive treatment for Dimeglio II and III congenital adduct clubfoot.</dc:description>
