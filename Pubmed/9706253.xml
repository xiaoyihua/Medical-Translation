<dc:description xml:lang="en">Tumor cells transduced with retrovirus carrying the herpes simplex-1 virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) are capable of transforming the antiviral drug ganciclovir (GVC) into a metabolic form only toxic to dividing cells. The efficiency of this suicide gene therapy is increased by a "bystander" effect resulting not only in the death of the recipient cell, but also in the death of non modified surrounding cells. Even though the mechanism of this "bystander" effect remains to be elucidated, strong evidence suggest that the immune system plays a main role to achieve complete tumor eradication. In the present study we evaluate the efficiency of this suicide system on three different tumor models: one human melanoma, one murine melanoma, and a rat glioblastoma. Tumors were established by injection of tumor cells s.c. in nude and C57Bl/6 mice, respectively, and stereotactically into the brain of Sprague Dawley rats. Animals in the treated group were co-injected with packaging cells producing recombinant retrovirus carrying the HSV-tk gene, and followed by i.p. administration of GVC. In short term studies, we observed inhibition of tumor growth for all the tumor models evaluated (p &lt; 0.01). In long term studies, using the C6 rat glioma line, 50% of the animals survived longer than 75 days (p &lt; 0.0001), and were able to reject a contralateral challenges with C6 parental cells. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence at an inflammatory infiltrate composed by T lymphocytes, macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells. These data demonstrate that suicide genes might represent an attractive form of cancer gene therapy in the treatment of brain tumors and their intracerebral dissemination.</dc:description>
