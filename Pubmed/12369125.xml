<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The aim of this study was to compare, under standard conditions (Peritoneal Equilibrium Test, "PET"), the peritoneal permeability to water and several solutes using icodextrin and glucose (3.86% and 1.36%) dialysates. The study includes 14 patients (3 women and 11 men), mean age 64 +/- 13 years, average time on peritoneal dialysis 23.5 +/- 17 months. PETs with icodextrin were performed in all of them (n = 14); PETs with 3.86% glucose were carried out in 7, and PETs with all the three solutions were performed in 5 patients. Samples were taken at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240 minutes, and after the rinsing procedure using 1.36% glucose in order to calculate the residual volume. RESULTS Sodium concentration in the effluent and D/P sodium did not change significantly from minute 0 to 240 with icodextrin and 1.36% glucose; but with 3.86% glucose both sodium and D/P sodium decreased at thirty minutes, remained at the same levels till the 120 minutes and then had a tendency to increase. Glucose concentration and osmolarity in the effluent did not vary throughout the time with icodextrin, but progressively decreased during the 4-hour period with 3.86% and 1.36% glucose solutions. The drainage after the 4-hour period was higher for the 3.86% glucose (2,608 +/- 388 ml, p = 0.03) than for the 1.36% glucose (2,070 +/- 120 ml) or the icodextrin (2,212 +/- 213 ml). Low molecular weight permeability: D/P creatinine after the 4-hour dwell was significantly lower for the icodextrin (0.66 +/- 0.1, p = 0.05) than for the 3.86% glucose (0.71 +/- 0.1) or the 1.36% glucose (0.72 +/- 0.1). The creatinine clearance for 3.86% glucose (7.4 +/- 0.4 ml/min p = 0.007) was higher than for icodextrin (5.6 +/- 0.5 ml/min) or for 1.36% glucose (5.8 +/- 0.6 ml/min). The clearances for total protein, albumin and beta 2-microglobulin did not show significant differences between the solutions. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirms that the icodextrin solution remains iso-osmolar with plasma during the 4-hour dwell. The sodium profile suggests that the ultrafiltration induced by icodextrin and 1.36% glucose depends on small pore-mediated sodium and water transport; on the other hand, 3.86% glucose also induces transport of water without solutes throughout the ultra-small aquaporin-mediated, pores, producing sodium dilution in the effluent. Ultrafiltration and solute clearances for icodextrin are lower than for 3.86 glucose during a 4-hour dwell.</dc:description>
