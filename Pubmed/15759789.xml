<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Lingual thyroid is a rare developmental anomaly originating from aberrant embryogenesis during descent of the gland from its site of origin, the foramen caecum, to its eutopic location. OBJECTIVE We present the case of a 30-year-old female with a history of dysphagia and pharyngeal foreign body sensation over the past 12 months, associated with hypothyroidism. METHODS Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are discussed. RESULTS Diagnosis of lingual thyroid was made and transoral thyroidectomy was performed as procedure-of-choice. Microscopic analysis revealed normal thyroid tissue with abundant colloid. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged 2 days after surgery. Gamma-gram with Tc99m was scheduled for postoperative follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Transoral lingual thyroidectomy followed by life-long hormonal therapy is the appropiate approach for patients with severe symptoms due to lingual thyroid hypertrophy associated with hypothyroidism.</dc:description>
