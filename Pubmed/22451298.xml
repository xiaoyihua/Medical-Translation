<dc:description xml:lang="en">Leuconostoc genus, belonging to the lactic acid bacteria group, are Gram-positive bacteria intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, broad distributed in nature and widely used in the food industry. Traditionally considered safe for humans, has recently been implicated in various diseases in susceptible individuals, increasingly isolated and with a broad profile of pathogenicity, and it is now classified as an emerging opportunistic pathogen. Children are particularly vulnerable, especially premature babies and those suffering from severe digestive pathology. The way of entry to the human organism has not been studied in depth. The most frequent are the altered intestine and the skin through loss of barrier integrity. Also are described contamination of parenteral and enteral nutrition, especially associated with the use of gastric tubes. Anecdotal cases reported in immunocompetent patients without underlying disease and no use of external devices have occurred in infants, as the case presented here.</dc:description>
