<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES There is limited evidence on procedural and clinical outcomes in patients treated with overlapping bioresorbable scaffolds vs overlapping everolimus-eluting stents. We evaluated the outcomes of propensity-matched patients treated with overlapping scaffolds vs everolimus-eluting stents. METHODS After propensity matching, 70 consecutive stable angina patients treated with overlapping bioresorbable scaffolds and 70 patients treated with overlapping new generation everolimus stents were included in this study. The primary outcome was the 1-year rate of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, nonprocedural myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization. RESULTS Patients in the 2 groups had similar age (scaffold vs stent: 64.5 ± 10.3 vs 66 ± 9.7 years; P=.381), sex, diabetes, previous cardiovascular history, and SYNTAX score (scaffold vs stent: 18.6 ± 9.2 vs 19.4 ± 10.4; P=.635). Postprocedural acute gain was significantly lower in patients treated with scaffolds (1.82±0.66 vs 2.03±0.68mm; P=.033). At 1-year follow up, the estimated major adverse cardiovascular event rate was not significantly different between the 2 groups (scaffold vs stent: 14.5% vs 14.6%; Plog-rank=.661). Similarly, no significant differences were seen in 1-year rates of target vessel (scaffold vs stent: 14.5% vs 10%; Plog-rank=.816) or target lesion revascularization (scaffold vs stent: 9.7% vs 8.3%; Plog-rank=.815). CONCLUSIONS Treating long lesions with overlapping scaffolds is feasible with acceptable 1-year outcomes.</dc:description>
