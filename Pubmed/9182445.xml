<dc:description xml:lang="en">Review of 17 female patients who underwent placing of Suburethral Sling as anti-incontinence procedure with the purpose of assessing the results obtained. The most frequent complications were urinary retention and post-surgical urgency. A larger proportion of patients with Stress Urinary Incontinence had retention and during more days than those with Mixed Urinary Incontinence. In most cases of mixed urinary incontinence, asymptomatic prior to surgery, the placing of a suburethral sling provokes signs and symptoms of urgency, and even of post-surgical urgency-incontinence. Both complications were attenuated in all cases using measures such as conservation of urinary by-pass or administration of anti-cholinergics. Results at 2 years have been successful in 68.75% cases, thus encouraging us to reduce the number of indications for this technique.</dc:description>
