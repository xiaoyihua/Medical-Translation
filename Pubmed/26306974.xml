<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Our aim was to assess the usefulness of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) to predict the risk of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a prospective cohort study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Clinical end-point was mortality rate. GFR was measured in ml/min/1.73 m2 and stratified in 3 categories (≥60; 45-59; &lt;45); UAE was measured in mg/24hours and was also stratified in 3 categories (&lt;30; 30-300; &gt;300). Mortality rates were reported per 1000 patient-years. Cox regression models were used to predict mortality risk associated with combined GFR and UAE. The predictive power was estimated with C-Harrell statistic. RESULTS A total of 453 patients (39.3% males), aged 64.9 (SD 9.3) years were included; mean diabetes duration was 10.4 (SD 7.5) years. Median follow-up was 13 years. Total mortality rate was 39.5/1000. The progressive increase in mortality in the successive categories of GFR and UAE was statistically significant (P&lt;.001). In a multivariable analysis, UAE (HR30-300=1.02 and HR&gt;300=2.83; X2=11.6; P =.003) and GFR (HR45-59=1.34 and HR&lt;45=1.84; X2=6.4; P =.041) were independent predictors for mortality, with no significant interaction. Simultaneous inclusion of GFR and UAE improved the predictive power of models (C-Harrell 0.741 vs. 0.726; P =.045). CONCLUSIONS GFR and UAE are independent predictors for mortality in type 2 diabetic patients and do not show a statistically significant interaction.</dc:description>
