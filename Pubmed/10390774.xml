<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Early diagnosis and therapeutic measures of frequent pathologies like hyperthyroidism made their neurological complications less frequent. In spite of well known, these neurological complications are some times forgotten. CLINICAL CASES We describe two myopathy cases, which presentation was namely fatigue. The inespecificity of this complaint create aetiology and syndromatic diagnosis difficulties, and therapeutic decision. In first case, the symptoms were very gradual, what is usual in older patients, and became extremely incapacitate, depending on others for every daily activity. In the second case, a young patient with diplopia suggested myasthenia. Both cases were diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and a quick improvement occurred with proper medication. Based in these cases, a thyrotoxic myopathy brief comment is made, as in spite of being frequent, these cases presented diagnosis difficulties.</dc:description>
