<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The aim of the study was to compare the galactomannan antigen (GA) and molecular biology (PCRrt) tests with the culture in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). MATERIAL AND METHODS Four hundred and seventy two samples were analyzed: 388 respiratory and 84 serum samples from 271 patients. Culture and GA were evaluated in the respiratory samples and GA in the serum samples. PCR was used when discrepancies were observed among culture and GA tests. RESULTS The detection of GA in serum was positive in 22 (of 84), 21 had the test positive respiratory sample. Of the 62 sera with negative GA, 45 were also negative respiratory specimens. The culture was positive in 37 of which were positive for GA. Comparing culture with AG, it showed PPV=23%, NPV=100%, S=100% and E=52%. The PCR showed respect to culture: PPV=69%, NPV=89%, S=64% and E=82%. In sera were found in 60% discrepancies between PCRrt and GA. CONCLUSIONS We consider useful the GA detection in serum combined with culture and GA in respiratory samples, for diagnosis of AI. PCR requires further studies for standardization and set breakpoints.</dc:description>
