<dc:description xml:lang="en">Currently, the Ebola virus has been classified by the WHO as "an international public health emergency" that has highlighted among other things, the enormous importance of proper and timely medical care. However, the complexity of this new health scenario, mainly due to personal risk in the event of infection, means that professionals are directly faced with situations of great ethical conflict since there is a competition between their duties to patients, colleagues, society and those directed to their own safety.

The philosophical foundations of these responses find their roots in the compassion and sense of responsibility that arise when we face helplessness.</dc:description>
