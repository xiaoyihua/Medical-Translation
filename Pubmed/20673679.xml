<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is produced and released mainly from ventricles. BNP has been shown to be useful in diagnosis and prognosis in heart failure and some pulmonary conditions. The aim of this study is to analyse whether NT-proBNP has a prognostic value in chronic pulmonary patients without overt heart failure. PATIENT AND METHOD We conducted an observational and prospective study. We included 192 patients admitted to the Internal Medicine Departments of Hospital Clinico "Lozano Blesa" (Zaragoza, Spain) and "Virgen de la Luz" (Cuenca, Spain) with acute exacerbation of pulmonary disease. Blood samples were taken to determine NT-proBNP concentrations. All patients were followed for 6 months after admission. RESULTS 6,3% of patients died, 22,9% were prescribed with home oxygen-therapy, 18,2% received a diuretic prescription and 21,9% were re-admitted at least once during the follow-up period. Mean NT-proBNP was 1180pg/ml. A concentration above 500pg/ml and 350pg/ml of NT-proBNP was useful to predict mortality and diuretic prescription respectively. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with acute exacerbations of chronic pulmonary disease, NT-proBNP could be a prognostic factor to identify those at risk of death or worst clinical development.</dc:description>
