<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Parvovirus B19 (B19) is associated with a wide range of diseases in humans, whose severity depends on the immunological and hematological status of the host. It is transmitted mainly through the airway but also by transfusions. AIM To determine the B19 DNA carrier frequency in a population of volunteer blood donors from three hospitals blood banks in Santiago, Chile, and to determine the viral load in DNA positive cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 477 serum samples were analyzed. The screening of B19 DNA was carried out by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) directed to the non-structural region of the virus (NS1). The viral load in positives cases was quantified by NS1 Real Time PCR. RESULTS Parvovirus B19 was detected in four samples, rendering a frequency of 1:119. The viral loads ranged from less than 2000 to 5626 x 10(5) genome equivalents/ml. CONCLUSIONS Parvovirus B19 was present in four of 477 blood bank blood donors from three hospitals in Santiago.</dc:description>
