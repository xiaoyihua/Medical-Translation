<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report a case of renal cell carcinoma associated with carcinoma of the colon. METHODS A right renal mass was detected during US control evaluation of a patient that had undergone surgery for rectosigmoid carcinoma 4 months earlier. A previous abdominal CT scan revealed a renal mass with characteristics of malignancy. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy showed clear cell renal carcinoma. This case was considered as two different and synchronous primaries, and the patient was submitted to surgery. RESULTS Intestinal adhesions secondary to radiotherapy were found intraoperatively, but there was no evidence of local intestinal recurrence, and therefore nephrectomy was performed. The histopathological study demonstrated clear cell renal carcinoma with intranuclear inclusions. CONCLUSIONS Although the patient may have a previous history of carcinoma at another site, the finding of a renal mass excludes synchronous tumors and nephrectomy should be the treatment of choice. The finding of clear cells in the cytological study supports the interpretation that these lesions were different primaries. Renal carcinoma should be included among the neoplasms with intranuclear inclusions.</dc:description>
