<dc:description xml:lang="en">A correlation between clinical and X-ray findings with histopathology in teeth diagnosed as necrotic 30 permanent human teeth with a deep carious lesion associated with a periapical radiolucency were studied. Results were based on the histopathologic findings, correlated with clinical and radiographic data, analyzed underlight microscope. The clinically diagnosed necrotic teeth with a periapical radiolucency were 19 (63.33%), showed remnants of vital pulp tissue under histologic observation, mainly in the medium and apical root thirds, in multi-rooted teeth. Presence of infiltrated bacteria was also observed at dentinal tubules coronally. 11 teeth (36.66%) remnants did not show any evidence of vital pulp tissue, only total necrosis was observed. This group showed the presence of bacteria infiltrated at the dentinal tubules coronally and into the root canals.</dc:description>
