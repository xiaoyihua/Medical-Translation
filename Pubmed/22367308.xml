<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determinate the trend of mortality from cervical cancer nationwide, by federative entities and socioeconomic regions during the years 2000-2008. METHODS The records of mortality associated to cervical cancer for the period 2000-2008 were obtained from the National Information System of the Secretariat of Health. This information is generated by the National Institute of Statistics Geography and Informatics through the death certificates issued all around the country. The codes of the international disease classification 10 that correspond to the basic cause of death from cervical cancer were identified. The rates of mortality nationwide, by federative entity and by socioeconomic region were calculated. Through Poisson regression analysis was compared mortality rates from cervical cancer of the socioeconomic regions and federative entities. The 7 socioeconomic regions were elaborated by the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics and include the 32 federative entities according to indicators that are related to well-being such as education, occupation, health, housing and employment. RESULTS The federative entities and socioeconomic region with the strongest association with mortality from cervical cancer in the period 2000-2008 were Colima (RR: 1.67, IC 95%: 1.11-2.25 for the year 2000; RR: 1.92, IC 95%: 1.29-2.85 for the year 2008); Veracruz (RR: 1.85,IC 95%: 1.51-2.27 for 2000; RR: 1.91, IC 95%: 1.55-2.35 for 2008); Yucatan (RR: 2.24, IC 95%: 1.74-2.88 for 2000; RR:1.90, IC 95%: 1.44-2.49 for 2008); and region 1 (RR: 1.41, IC 95%: 1.23-1.6 for 2001; RR: 1.38, IC 95%: 1.2-1.58 for 2007).In this region for the year 2000 and 2008 the RR was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS Mortality rates per 100,000 women standardized using the world population decreased from 13.3 to 8.6 in the period 2000-2008. The entities and region with the strongest force of association with mortality due to cervical cancer were Colima, Veracruz,Yucatan and region 1.</dc:description>
