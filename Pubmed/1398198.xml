<dc:description xml:lang="en">During the period 1987 to 1990 at Hospital Luis Castelazo Ayala, IMSS, a prospective study was carried out. For this study 374 bilateral tubal obstructions (BTO) were included in interval of gestation by means of laparoscopy with silastic rings. The objective was to observe the status presented by the organs contained in the pelvic cavity of women considered healthy; so, as to present pathology, opportunely treat it. Main findings were: Pelvic adhesions 37 cases (9.8%), uterine myomatosis 33 cases (8.8%), tubal pathology 18 cases (4.8%), ovarian cysts 11 cases (2.9%), and endometriosis 9 cases (2.4%). Global pathology was 108 cases (28.8%). The use of laparoscopy in BTO allows to find non expected pathology in apparently healthy women and offers them the opportunity of receiving treatment immediately, avoiding thus to attribute to BTO symptomatology that could be derived from existing pathology.</dc:description>
