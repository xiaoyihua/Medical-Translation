<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Neurological disorders are common in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The objective of this study is to show the possible association of peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) in persons who test positive for HIV, which because of the characteristics of outpatient management is important in basic medical attention. PATIENTS AND METHODS The scope of our study included all patients observed in 1998 and the first six months of 1999 who had PFP, and in whom detailed clinical history, physical examination by a neurologist, laboratory tests and HIV serological tests were done. RESULTS We found that 89.1% of the patients with PFP were seropositive. The facial paralysis showed similar characteristics to Bell s palsy, with complete recovery after four weeks in 66.6% of this group of patients. The seronegative patients also recovered completely but took longer to do so. In two cases the PFP was associated with obvious features of AIDS. CONCLUSIONS In the literature reviewed we have not found such a large group of patients with PFP associated with HIV+. However, it is obvious that there is an increase in facial paralysis which is in proportion to the increase in HIV+ persons. The results of our study suggest to us that HIV should be tested for in patients with PFP.</dc:description>
