<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The dimension of the autistic spectrum embraces a considerable degree of clinical complexity which is, in turn, an expression of the numerous systems involved in the functioning of the central nervous system. Every day different biological factors are revealed which put in doubt other factors that, in a more objective way, appear to be involved in a particular aetiology. DEVELOPMENT AND CONCLUSIONS It is clear that exactly what causes autistic spectrum disorder is still unknown and it may be useful to analyse cases with a known aetiology and correlate them with other similar cases, as it is likely to be this association between findings and studies in the future that will probably enable us to better define the bases and the underlying causes of the complex and manifold origin of the autistic spectrum. This will enable a more efficient therapeutic approach to be developed, which, when all is said and done, is what is primarily sought in the management of children with autistic spectrum disorder.</dc:description>
