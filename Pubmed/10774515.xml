<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Despite the proven efficacy of zidovudine (ZDV) for reducing perinatal transmission of HIV-1, questions remain about its implementation and effectiveness in routine practice. The aims of this study were to assess the impact of ZDV administered during pregnancy in preventing perinatal HIV-1 transmission, and to determine the proportion of early identification of maternal HIV-1 infection over time. PATIENTS AND METHODS We prospectively followed from birth a cohort of children born between 1/1/1987 and 31/10/1997 to HIV-1-infected mothers. Infant infection status was assessed by follow-up beyond 18 months or HIV-PCR up to 3 months of age. RESULTS 229 mothers and 248 infants were identified in the cohort. ZDV was administered during pregnancy as monotherapy to 34 mothers for a mean of 4.7 (3.1) months prior to delivery. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the treated and untreated groups. Mean (SD) CD4 cell count was 465 (261) cells x 10(6)/l. Factors associated with transmission were a more prolonged time of rupture of obstetric membranes (median 6 vs 1.04 hours; p = 0.023) and ZDV treatment. Among the ZDV-treated mothers only one child was infected (2.9%), whereas 37 children born to 212 untreated women became infected. (OR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.07-0.92). The estimated prevalence of HIV-1 in pregnant women in our area is about 0.39% (95% CI: 0.34-0.45). From 1987 to 1991, 9.7% of infected women were nor identified at the perinatal period, as compared to 2.5% in the last 5 years of the study period (p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS In this study, the estimated prevalence of HIV-1 infection is high. ZDV during pregnancy is significantly associated with a decrease in perinatal transmission in our setting. The awareness of an effective treatment might have contributed to the increased identification of HIV-infected mothers prior to delivery observed over time in our cohort of children born to HIV-infected mothers.</dc:description>
