<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES 1) To make an integrated evaluation of the cognitive status, functional capacity, chronic disorders and social situation of the over-75 age group. 2) To find this group's self-perception of their health. DESIGN A descriptive crossover study. SETTING The Gòtic Health District in Barcelona. PARTICIPANTS 316 people were included in the study. They were chosen by simple randomised sampling from the over-75s seen at the centre (n = 1,625). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS To assess cognitive status, the Pfeiffer Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire was used; for functional capacity, the Katz Index; and for chronic disorders, the medical records were reviewed. A questionnaire was used to find patients' social situation and assessed social relationships, social resources used and architectonic barriers. Self-perception of health status was evaluated using the Nottingham Health Profile. Prevalence of cognitive deterioration was 29.7%. 39.4% of patients were dependent in one or more basic activities of their daily life. 90.8% had a chronic disorder, the most frequent being AHT, arthrosis, obesity and dyslipemias. 28.3% lived alone and 26.7% used social services. CONCLUSIONS We think this kind of assessment is useful in primary care. It would provide an integrated diagnosis (clinical, functional, medical and social) of elderly patients.</dc:description>
