<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Reducing inequalities in health is one of the main objectives in any healthcare system. Several studies have analyzed inequalities in health in the Spanish population. However, the empirical evidence for the immigrant population is still insufficient. This study aim to quantify socioeconomic inequalities in health in the immigrant population living in Spain, in comparison with the national population. METHODS To measure socioeconomic inequalities in health, we used a methodology based on the Concentration Index with data from the 2003 and 2006 Spanish National Health Surveys. RESULTS According to the results there were socioeconomic inequalities in health for the health variables considered favoring high-income individuals. However, inequalities were lower for the immigrant subgroup than for the national population, although the magnitude of inequalities considerably increased between 2003 and 2006 for the immigrant population. CONCLUSIONS This study shows the importance of socioeconomic position in explaining differences in health both in the national and in the immigrant population and provides evidence that could be used to design appropriate strategies to reduce inequalities in health in the immigrant collective in Spain.</dc:description>
