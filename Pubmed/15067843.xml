<dc:description xml:lang="en">The feeding habits practiced by a society are a good indicator for the possible appearance of specific pathologies, some as common as obesity of hypertension. Nursing professionals have the difficult task of attempting to modify the harmful habits acquired during childhood by following the family feeding patterns and those habits acquire as each individual grows up due to the influences of his/her surroundings, such as fads and advertising. A health industry professional must practice what he/she preaches; you can not promote healthy living habits if you do not practice these oneself. For this reason, the authors have studied the feeding habits, along with some unhealthy living habits, such as a sedentary lifestyle or smoking, of 300 first year nursing students in Catalonia in 2001-2002 since they will be the ones responsible for promoting healthy lifestyles among the general population.</dc:description>
