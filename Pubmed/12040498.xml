<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The International Classification of epilepsies and epileptic syndromes, proposed in 1989, have proven to be of considerable value and suministered a universal vocabulary for physicians. The use have identified also some disadvantages and the rapid advances in neuroimage and molecular genetics has become clear that reappraisal is needed. DEVELOPMENT An ILAE Task Force on Classification and Terminology is proposing a diagnostic scheme that makes use of standardized terminology and concepts to describe individual patients. The proposal include several definitive changes and terminology very logic but there is some new concepts that is not properly clear. The diagnostic scheme is made of flexible and dynamic modules. It consist of five level o axes: ictal phenomenology, seizure type, syndrome, etiology and impairement. It is lacking on axis about age at onset that is very important in some epileptic syndromes. The syndromic diagnosis is derived from a list of accepted epilepsy syndromes and of the syndromes are still in development, although no contain some syndromes of recent description. Finally it is proposed an example of a classification of epilepsy syndromes, grouping the syndromes according to age at onset and etiology.</dc:description>
