<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION We present a new technique for the surgical treatment of haemorrhoids, consisting of the repositioning of haemorrhoid cluster, using a rotating Proctoscope called Hemor Pex System((R)) (HPS). This procedure is performed as an outpatient procedure, with minimal postoperative pain and rapid integration into working life. OBJECTIVES To present the experience with this technique during 3 years of follow up in two institutions in Genoa, Italy. PATIENTS AND METHODS from January 2003 to June 2006, 1112 patients with grade II, III and IV haemorrhoids were operated on using the HPS technique, in two different hospitals. Prospectively analyzed the following parameters: postoperative pain, incidence of complications and recurrence of symptoms. RESULTS A total of 1112 patients were operated, of whom 719 have completed the follow-up. The mean age was 47 years. In 92% of cases the intervention was performed under local anaesthesia. The average time of surgery time was 20+/-5min. A total of 97% of patients were discharged at 6h after surgery. The immediate postoperative pain, according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS): absent (0) in 38 cases, slight (1-3) in 431 cases, 218 medium and intense in 32 cases. CONCLUSIONS We believe HPS is a safe procedure, with a short learning curve for surgeons, and in particular leads to a great reduction in post-operative pain for the patient.</dc:description>
