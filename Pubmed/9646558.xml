<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of the study was to describe the seroprevalence against Parvovirus B19 in a random sample of blood donors in the Hospital Universitario de Salamanca. METHODS We studied the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies against Parvovirus B19 in 136 sera from asymptomatic blood donors by enzyme immunoassay methods. RESULTS From 136 samples tested, 88 (64.7%) had positive absorbance values for IgG. Forty eight samples (35.5%) were negative. IgM was negative in all cases. We did not find indeterminate results. DISCUSSION Parvovirus primoinfection usually happens in the childhood. Thus, we can expect a high percentage of general population to have antibodies against Parvovirus B19. Anti-Parvovirus B19 antibodies prevalence in blood donors was 64.7%. This failure is similar to data reported before (65%). Clinical importance of these viruses in currently related with hemathopoyesis diseases and with the possible role in theratogenesis. The presence of IgG seems to give protection except in some chronic infections recently described.</dc:description>
