<dc:description xml:lang="en">Three serological techniques for hydatid disease were compared using 60 human serum samples obtained from 29 patients with hydatidosis previously demonstrated by surgery, 15 apparently healthy individuals and 16 persons with different pathologies. The results obtained with these 3 techniques showed some differences that could associate with the anatomical location of the parasite and the biological stage of the hydatid cysts. The global sensitivity of the techniques was 96.6% for ELISA, 86.2% for IHAT and 79.3 for DD5. False positive reactions were observed with IHAT and ELISA in sera from patients with infection by Taenia saginata. ELISA also showed cross reactions in the sera of four patients with intestinal infection by Ascaris lumbricoides. No false positive reactions were observed with DD5 test.</dc:description>
