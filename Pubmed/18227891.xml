<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Hand Hygiene (HH) is the most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial infections. The objective was to evaluate the program for updating recommendations on HH that had been introduced. INTERVENTIONS between March-October/2005 realisation of updating sessions about when and how to realize HH and May/2006 distribution of an explicative three-part document to all healthcare workers reporting on compliance with the recommendations. Indicators: level of knowledge (LK) measured with a questionnaire of five questions that was given to those attending before and after sessions, responses were considered inadequate when three or more questions were not answered; consumption of alcoholic solutions (CAS) on ml/stay grouped into semesters from 2004-2006; compliance (CO) with recommendations on HH was measured by direct observation at two times (December/2005-February/2006 and October-November/2006); and infections prevalence (IP) and patients with infection (IPP) for EPINE studies 2004-2005-2006. RESULTS The frequency of inadequate answers for evaluating LK has fallen from 57.5% before to 18.9% afterwards (p &lt;0.001). The CAS for HH has passed from 3 ml/stay in 2nd semester/2004 to 17 ml/stay 2nd semester/2006 (p &lt;0.001). The CO with HH has risen from 31.0% to 55.6% (p &lt;0.001). The IP and IPP have risen respectively from 11.4% and 9.6% in 2004 to 9.4% and 8.9% in 2006 (N.S.). CONCLUSION The program is progressively achieving its objectives as the three process indicators (LK, CAS, CO) have improved in a statistically significant way, and the indicators of results (IP and IPP) have improved but without achieving statistical significance.</dc:description>
