<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION To evaluate if the association between the BODE index and deterioration in health-related quality of life is linear. To determine possible associations between the BODE index and health status evaluated by the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at all levels of disease severity in COPD. METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out on 253 patients from two Latin American respiratory centers (Brazil and Chile) with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, based on GOLD criteria. Assessment included the BODE index and the SGRQ questionnaire. RESULTS Patients had a BODE index of 3.1±2.0; FEV1 (%) of 49±19.2; BMI (kg/m(2)) of 24.7±5.1; 6MWT distance (meters) of 444±96. Significant correlations were found between the BODE index and SGRQ total scores (r=0.5; &lt;0.001), impact (r=0.45; &lt;0.001) and activity (r=0.5; &lt;0.001). From BODE score zero, HRQOL was already compromised in all SGRQ domains. SGRQ scores (total and domain) increased progressively for individual components of the BODE index, with the decrease in airflow limitation (&lt;0.05), BMI (&lt;0.002) and 6MWT (&lt;0.05), and with the increase in the Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) score (&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION There is an association between health-related quality of life, as assessed by the SGRQ and the BODE index within the entire spectrum of COPD severity. Even in early disease stages and BODE index zero, health-related quality of life is already impaired.</dc:description>
