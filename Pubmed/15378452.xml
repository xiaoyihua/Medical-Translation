<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Semantic verbal fluency (SVF) tests are often used in basic neuropsychological evaluation. They are not time consuming and are easy to apply, but the normative data have been validated mainly for the Anglo-Saxon population, which can lead us to make mistakes in classifying normality. AIMS To evaluate the category 'things you can buy at a supermarket' as a task for exploring SVF applied to a Castilian-speaking population of Spaniards with the aim of conducting a pilot normative test in our milieu. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The 'things you can buy at a supermarket' task was applied to a sample of 139 healthy subjects without cognitive impairment, whose mother tongue is Spanish. The subjects were subclassified according to their level of schooling in years, age groups and sex. RESULTS Total mean production (1 minute) = 20.1 +/- 8. No differences were seen in the comparative analysis according to sexes. By age: &lt; 50 years = 33 +/- 6; 50-59 = 24.6 +/- 6; 60-69 = 16.5 +/- 5; 70-79 = 15.5 +/- 6; &gt; 79 years = 13.5 +/- 6. By years of schooling: &lt; 10 years = 19 +/- 6; &gt; 10 years = 29 +/- 5. CONCLUSIONS Mean output of words is 20 in one minute, with a percentile distribution where the deficit criterion (p10) would be in an output below 10 words. Overall, greater output is observed in the first half minute. There are a number of socio-demographic factors, such as age and mean number of years of schooling, that have been proved statistically to exert an influence on semantic capacity in this test. No differences were observed according to sex. We present the mean results, as well as the overall percentile distribution and results according to age and schooling, because we think they can serve as preliminary normative data in our milieu.</dc:description>
