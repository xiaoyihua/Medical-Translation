<dc:description xml:lang="en">The analysis of the common bundle and of the ventrical filtered electrograms has incrased our knowledge of the intraventricular conduction following the simulation of the PVS as well as the different types or reciprocating that can be produced by premature beats. 2. The positive QRS complexes in V1 produced from PVD by St2 can be explained as a greater degree of incomplete recuperation of the right ventricular wall than in the interventricular septum. In contrast with what happened in the basal beats, where the front took longer to reach the TSVD than the VI. 3. The refractarines of the transitional tissues that serve as the phisiological banier was longer than the banal myocardium. The intraventricular propagation, and therefore the morphology and direction of QRS, depended of this one; while the moment of arrival of activation retrogradly to the common bundle was conditioned by the transitional tissues. 4. Episodes of ventricular taquicardies with QRS positive complexes in V1 can be due to a re-entry throught the bundle branches or in (or around) an area that has been recently injured.</dc:description>
