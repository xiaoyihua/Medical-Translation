<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The usefulness of the exercise test in evaluating patients with an acute myocardial infarction treated with fibrinolytics is controversial. On the other hand, the prognostic value of a patent infarct-related artery has not been clearly established. The objectives of this study were to assess the validity of the exercise test and to study the prognostic value of the artery patency after a myocardial infarction. MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied 99 patients with a myocardial infarction treated with fibrinolytics, non-complicated. An exercise test and a cardiac catheterization were performed in the first month. The patients were followed-up for 2 years, recording the major cardiac events (death and reinfarction) and the minor events (angina class (II, left cardiac failure class (II or maintained ventricular tachycardia). RESULTS On multivariate analysis with Cox regression, a workload &lt; 4 METS at the exercise test was the only independent prognostic factor of major events (RR 5.6; CI 95% 1.68-19). The independent prognostic factors of minor events were: multivessel disease (RR 3.36; CI 95% 1.56-7.24), anterior infarction (RR 3.15; CI 95% 1.3-7.6), abnormal exercise test (RR 2.98; CI 95% 1.46-6.09) and ejection fraction &lt; or = 40% (RR 2.48; CI 95% 1.07-5.74). The patency of the infarct-related artery was not a predictor of events. CONCLUSIONS The exercise test is useful in predicting the prognosis in patients treated with fibrinolytics. An occluded infarct-related artery was not an independent predictor of cardiac events in 2 years of follow-up.</dc:description>
