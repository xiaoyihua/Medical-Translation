<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to describe the characteristics of traumatic brain injury (TEC) in children seen at the Cayetano Heredia National Hospital from 2004 to 2011, a case study was conducted. 316, 14 year-old minors were included, the median age was 4 ± 3 years old. 63.9% were male. The main causes of TEC were falls (80.1%) and car accidents (10.4%). 42.4% (134/316) occurred in the afternoon. There was a higher incidence of falls at home (59.2%). The epidural hematoma (26.9%) was the most common intracraneal injury. Intensive care management and neurosurgical interventions were required in 15.8 and 14.2% of cases respectively. It is concluded that domestic falls were the main cause of accidents for TEC and epidural hematoma the most common intracranial injury where children under 5 were the most affected.</dc:description>
