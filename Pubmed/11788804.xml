<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The objectives of the present study were: 1) to determine the frequency of oral mucosa lesions and to analyze their relationship with toxic habits (tobacco and alcohol), and 2) to determine the prevalence of the oral pathology in patients who are denture wearers, to establish necessities for treatment and the opportune preventive measures. STUDY DESIGN The study was carried out in patients attending the Oviedo Stomatology School to receive treatment for periodontal or prosthodontic dental pathology; but not for oral mucosal disorders. 337 patients were examined (140 males and 197 females). The ages ranged from 30 to 85 years. A clinical protocol was elaborated which included lesions previously reported in epidemiological studies. RESULTS The number of patient with lesions was 198 (58,75%). The pathology diagnosed with more frequency was Melanin Pigmentation (n=83; 24,6%), followed by Frictional Keratosis (n=39; 11,5%), Linea Alba (n=34; 10,7%), Cheek Biting (n=23; 6,8%) and Traumatic Ulcer (n=16; 4,7%). In the patients who were denture wearers, the most frequent pathology was Hyperplasia (n=17; 5%) and Stomatitis (n=9; 2,6%). A statistically significant relation was observed between denture wearers and Traumatic Keratosis, Leucoplakia and Candidosis Pseudomembranous; tobacco habit and Leucoplakia presence, Frictional Keratosis and Melanin Pigmentation; and between alcohol habit and Traumatic Keratosis. CONCLUSIONS Our results have shown the necessity to periodically examine denture wearers, and to establish the opportune preventive measures to eradicate the pathology that this causes. The observation of the association between Traumatic Keratosis, and two factors related with the etiology and prognosis of oral cancer should awake maximum interest in its correct diagnosis and treatment.</dc:description>
