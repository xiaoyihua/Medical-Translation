<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Quantification of circulating levels of granulocyte elastase has been shown to be a reliable method to predict severity of acute pancreatitis. The ELISA method until now available is, however, not easily applicable to the clinical routine. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the present study we analyzed, retrospectively the clinical usefulness of an automated granulocyte elastase assay, the immunoactivation (IMAC) procedure, in predicting the course of acute pancreatitis, and we compared it with the ELISA method. PATIENTS Plasma samples from 39 patients with acute pancreatitis, 18 with mild episodes and 21 with severe disease, were analyzed for granulocyte elastase concentration by both automated and manual ELISA procedures, on admission and on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. RESULTS Automated elastase values did not differ statistically (Mann-Whitney test) from manual granuloma elastase values obtained by ELISA. Higher plasma elastase concentration was invariably found in severe pancreatitis when compared to mild cases. The optimal discriminating (severe vs mild illness) cutoff values were 200 micrograms/L on admission and 250 micrograms/L at 24 hours. Both assays showed similar prognostic reliability upper 90 per cent. CONCLUSIONS Automated procedures enable faster and simpler granulocyte elastase determinations and exploit the benefits of this early and efficient prognostic marker.</dc:description>
