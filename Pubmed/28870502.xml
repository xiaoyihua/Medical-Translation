<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyse the efficiency of nurse prescription of the health products inherent to their care work, in Andalusia, Spain, between the years 2009-2015. To also analyse the discussions by the Medical Colleges Organisation and the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality, before the draft bill on nurse prescription and their outcome. DESIGN Scoping review. DATA SOURCE Main bibliographic databases of Latin-American, Spanish, and foreign languages were reviewed, including, Fundación Index, Doyma, and Medline Library. Google Scholar was also used with the same search terms, adding to limit the search the term "Andalusia": "prescription nurse" AND "efficiency" OR "Andalusia". Another search was conducted in the grey literature using the same criteria in the Andalusian Health Service (SAS) web site. It was complemented with an interview with the care director of the SAS. DATA EXTRACTION A total of 617 articles were found, of which 20 were selected. In the grey literature, 52 documents were found, of which 4 were used. RESULTS Few studies were found on the efficiency in nurse prescription in Andalusia, although they are as strong as the data provided by the Andalusian Health Care Directorate on the health products inherent in their profession. After modification of Royal Decree 954/2015, and under pressure from the Medical Colleges Organisation, it leaves the competence of prescription nurse exclusively to the medical indication, who diagnoses and prescribes and eliminates it without argument scientifically endorsed. CONCLUSIONS We corroborate the incorporation of efficiency in the Health System through the nurse prescription, and the rupture with the Royal Decree 954/2015. The allegations of the Medical Colleges Organisation are without argument.</dc:description>
