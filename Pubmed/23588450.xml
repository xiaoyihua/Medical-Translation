<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Vitamin D and calcium play an important role in peak bone mass acquisition. Recent studies have suggested that vitamin D deficiency in children is widespread, mainly during infancy and adolescent years. However, the vitamin D status at others ages is unsufficiently investigated. OBJECTIVES To determine the vitamin D status in prepubertal, healthy South European girls, and to examine the relationship between serum vitamin D concentrations, sun exposure, physical activity and dietary intake. METHODS A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on 56 Caucasian; healthy and prepubertal girls aged 7-10 years. Dietary information, amount of sunlight exposure and activity were estimated. Blood samples were extracted in the first week of December. RESULTS Vitamin D intake was below the international recommended references. Mean serum vitamin D was 40.07 ± 10.49 ng/ml. No girl presented a level lower than 20 ng/ml; 25% had levels between 20-30 ng/ml and 75% above 30 ng/ml. We have not found differences in vitamin D levels from the girls who did sport and those who were sedentary. CONCLUSIONS Vitamin D status is suitable for prepubertal girls living in the South of Spain at the beginning of winter. However, it is necessary to follow-up girls and check and adequate vitamin D intake, as well as sufficient sun exposure.</dc:description>
