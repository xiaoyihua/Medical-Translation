<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic behavior of different members of a department of internal medicine towards some neoplasms, analyzing the study times, reasons for suspicion and the number of tests performed and their results. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective review of the clinical histories of the patients admitted from January 1, 1992 to June 30, 1994 whose diagnosis was a new neoplasm of the digestive tract, lung cancer, cancer of unknown origin or lymphoma was carried out. The total diagnostic study time and the different partial times were measured and confirmed. The causes leading to suspicion of the neoplasms were also analyzed by groups, and finally the efficacy of the different diagnostic tests; either non invasive, oriented at the decision of the definitive test, or invasive (biopsies and fine needle aspiration puncture). RESULTS The median total study time was 13 days with no differences between the groups. The median time until clinical suspicion was 0 days (interquartile range 0-2), being significantly greater in the digestive neoplasms. Less than half of the total study time corresponded to the clinical work itself (5 vs. 8 days). Suspicion of neoplasms in 49% of the cases arose from radiographic alteration and in 30% from clinical alterations. With regards to diagnostic tests, the value of thorax X-ray as the first exploration, mainly in the lung neoplasms (82.5% of the radiographies showed alterations), the elevated efficacy of computerized tomography, among the non invasive tests and fine needle aspiration puncture among the invasive tests were of note. Definitive diagnosis was achieved in 62% of the cases by biopsy and in 31% by fine needle aspiration puncture. CONCLUSIONS Not all the time spent in achieving diagnosis of neoplasms is attributable to clinical work, although this may be shortened. To do so, a faster and more adequate use of the tests of greater performance (thorax X-ray, computerized tomography and fine needle aspiration puncture) should be used and performed with greater coordination and cooperation among the clinical technicians and physicians of the different departments.</dc:description>
