<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In the management of mitochondrial diseases, it is most important to know what mitochondrias are, how they function and the pattern of inheritance present on the different conditions affecting them. DEVELOPMENT An overview of mitochondrial function, inheritance, clinical and biochemical classification is done, reviewing the different fatty acid oxidation, pyruvic metabolism and respiratory chain defects. Classification by age of onset is also done. Approach to diagnosis, clinical aspects, laboratory findings and available treatment is discussed. Some comments about the use of a neurometabolic database are discussed, where more than 150 conditions are described in detail. CONCLUSIONS By using the search capabilities of the software, a search by age of onset, symptoms, signs and laboratory findings help in reaching the most probable diagnosis in a given child, with its recommended current management.</dc:description>
