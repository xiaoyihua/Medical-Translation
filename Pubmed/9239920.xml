<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Maternal and infantile morbidity is closely related to the features of women's reproductive history. AIM To study the reproductive behavior of women hospitalized due to labor or abortion in a public maternity of Metropolitan Santiago. SUBJECTS AND METHODS One thousand women were interviewed about their reproductive behavior, 24 to 72 hours after pregnancy resolution. RESULTS Ages of interviewed women ranged from 13 to 47 years old. Eighty seven percent had three children or less. The proportion of single women with a first pregnancy was 62% and decreased to 9.3% in those with a second pregnancy. At the first pregnancy, 1.3% of women were using contraceptives, notwithstanding that 27% did not want to become pregnant. Most women had a birth spacing of 24 to 59 months. There was a low number of stillbirths in this sample. CONCLUSIONS This work shows that studied women have pregnancies at low risk ages and an adequate parity.</dc:description>
