<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the factors that lead to extubation failure among preterm newborns (PTN). MATERIAL AND METHODS Failure was determined when patients had to be reintubated during the first 72 hours. Critically-ill preterm newborns needing mechanical assisted ventilation at least during 24 hours were studied prospectively. Two groups were included: Group A, who failed in extubation for the first time and Group B, a control group who did not fail. Significance was set a p &lt;0.05. RESULTS Gestational age and birth weight showed significant differences in Group B (control group). Significant factors in the multivariate analysis were gestational age &lt; 32 weeks, caloric intake &lt; or = 100 calories/kg/day and mean airway pressure (MAP) &gt; or = [corrected] 4.5 cm H2O. CONCLUSIONS According to our results, an extubation should be planned whenever a patient is a PTN, has a gestational age of &lt;32 weeks, a caloric intake &gt;100 cal/kg/day, and its ventilator MAP is &lt;4.5 cm H2O.</dc:description>
