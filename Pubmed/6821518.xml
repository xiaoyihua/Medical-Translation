<dc:description xml:lang="en">One antimicrobial substance was obtained from the epicarp of the fruits of Paulownia fortunei and Paulownia tomentosa. Other parts of the fruits and leaves had no detectable antimicrobial activity. The substance was active in vitro for Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis while it had lower activity for Saccharomyces carlsbergensis and the lowest was for Escherichia coli. The active material was extracted with organic solvents (ether, ethanol and acetone). The activity "in vitro" was demonstrated by the method of dilution in nutrient agar media. The active substance looked as a resin and was insoluble in water at neutral or acid pH. It was very soluble in strong alkaline pH solution.</dc:description>
