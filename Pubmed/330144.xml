<dc:description xml:lang="en">To provide more information to participants in the Second Meeting of the Textbook Committee of PAHO/WHO for the teaching of the Morphological Sciences in the Medical Schools of Latin American, a survey was held of the departments of those sciences, in 150 Latin American schools to acquire updated information on the academic organization, the work schedule of the teachers, the levels of integration of the instruction, use of textbooks by students, and the degree of familiarity with the PAHO/WHO Testbook Program and its coverage. The results of the survey, presented in detail in this document, demonstrate the persistence of most of the problems discussed in the First Meeting of the Committee (1969), which makes it necessary to reconsider the integrated teaching of the morphological sciences and the strategies for attaining it. The document also analyzes the development of the morphological sciences and of integration in them.</dc:description>
