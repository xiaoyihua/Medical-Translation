<dc:description xml:lang="en">The uterine leiomyomas (UL) are tumors compound by smooth muscle connective tissue. Growth depends mainly of two basic mechanisms: hypertrophy of myometrial cells and connective tissue deposit. The quantification of the basic elements of the tumor permits to try its application as biochemical markers of disease, auxiliary diagnostic criteria, or in medical therapeutical monitorization, alternative that lately has become very important. In the present study 33 patients are included, in two groups. Group I women with uterine leiomyomatosis (n = 17) and Group II (n = 16) without UL. A prospective, double blind, transversal of cases and control study. Connective tissue concentration was evaluated based on collagen determination. The evaluation of muscular tissue was done by desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) measurement. The results showed a significant increase in connective tissue concentration (until 500%) and a significant diminution of cellularity (DNA) in women with UL, as compared with control group. The main biochemical and clinical implications of these findings, are commented upon.</dc:description>
