<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to find out genetic variability and its possible association with chromosomic damage, we studied the ABO, Rh and MN blood groups as well as the ability to taste PTC, ear lobe type and mid-digital hair, in 77 workers exposed to lead oxides. 23 people who worked near the source of lead (internal control) and 20 people not exposed to lead (external control). From each person a blood sample was taken for chromosome analysis in cultured lymphocytes and for lead determination, at the same time an urine sample was taken for delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) determinations; at the same time an urine sample increased chromosome damage, blood lead levels and urinary ALA, were found as compared with both controls. Differences were statistically significant. As for genetic marker frequencies differences were found only for the Rh factor, between the internal control and both the external control and exposed workers. No significant association was found between genetic markers and chromosome damage. Association was observed between blood lead levels, and urinary ALA with some genetic markers like ABO and MN blood groups and ear lobe type.</dc:description>
