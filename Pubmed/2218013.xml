<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this investigation is demonstrated that the nurse needs, in order to carry out a successful work, to learn about the composition of the population of the area under her care. In Patana, a Maisí municipality with 165 inhabitants, 93 male and 72 females, prevailing ninth grade school level and an initial low hygienic culture level, which is considered as regular at the present time, intestinal parasitism and malnutrition are the main diseases in the zone. It is well demonstrated that there is a wide relationship between hygienic conditions at home and community and the incidence of the fore-mentioned diseases and that the educational work performed by the nurse in the area under her care exerts a positive influence, but the support of grassroot mass organizations is required.</dc:description>
