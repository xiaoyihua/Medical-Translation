<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To examine the type and duration of antifungal prophylaxis provided during the postoperative period of lung transplant recipients, together with the most frequent complications during admission to Intensive Care Units in Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS A questionnaire was developed including demographic data on each transplant center, the type of antifungal prophylaxis used, its duration, and the most frequent complications. The questionnaire was distributed among the 7 Spanish national lung transplant centers, followed by analysis of the results obtained. RESULTS All 7 centers completed the questionnaire. All of them provided universal prophylaxis in lung transplant patients. Monotherapy was the most widely used protocol (5/7; 71.4%), with amphotericin B in liposomal or conventional form being the most frequent drug, administered via the inhalatory route. In the case of combination therapy, a great diversity of drugs was observed. The most frequently administered second choice drug was anidulafungin (3/7; 43%), followed by voriconazole (2/7; 28.5%). Antifungal therapy was maintained on an indefinite basis by 43% of the centers. Invasive fungal infection (IFI) in the postoperative period of transplantation during admission to the Intensive Care Unit was suspected in 5-10% of the cases but was confirmed in less than 5%. Among other complications registered in these patients in the Intensive Care Unit, the most frequent problems were respiratory infections (5/7; 71.5%). CONCLUSIONS Antifungal prophylaxis during the postoperative period of lung transplantation is provided on a universal basis, though consensus is lacking as to the drug of choice, the administration route and the duration of such treatment.</dc:description>
