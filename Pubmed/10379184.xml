<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To compare medical students' simulated learning of two different techniques of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). One was conventional external cardiac massage (ECM) and the other was active compression-decompression (ACD-CPR). MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group (group S) comprised 111 students enrolled in their fourth year of medical studies who had no prior experience of CPR. Group R, the control group, was made up of 32 medical residents in anesthesiology and post-anesthetic intensive care. Before the study, group S received 5 hours of theoretical classes on CPR and both groups saw a video explaining each technique just before performing the test. All subjects applied each method to an adult dummy for one minute. The variables evaluated were frequency of complete and effective thoracic compressions and the body weight of the resuscitator. RESULTS Each group performed similarly using the two techniques in terms of frequency of total compressions achieved. For each technique, the number of effective compressions achieved by group S (49.4 +/- 22.9 with ECM and 42.5 +/- 20.7 with ACD-CPR) was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) than the number attained by group R (71.2 +/- 18.6 with ECM and 58.8 +/- 12 with ACD-CPR). Group R's frequency of effective compressions was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) with CPR than with ACD-CPR. Body weight had no influence on the number of total compressions or efficacy in group R, whereas lower body weight in group S was significantly related to lower frequency of effective compressions with ECM p &lt; 0.05). Neither group achieved a frequency of 80 total compressions in one minute. CONCLUSIONS With the present teaching method, the medical students' performance was poor for both types of CPR and was affected by body weight. The residents' performance was less effective with ACD-CPR, a technique that was new to them, than with conventional ECM, with which they were expert and on which body weight had no impact.</dc:description>
