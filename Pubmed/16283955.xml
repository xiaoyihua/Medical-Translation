<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In recent years, surgical correction of esophageal atresia with distal tracheoesophageal fistula has become increasingly successful. However, there is still a group of high-risk patients with specific factors in whom the mortality remains appreciable. These associated factors include weight, gestational age, associated malformations and respiratory distress. MATERIAL AND METHODS This report analyzes the mortality in 80 newborn infants with variants of esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula who were treated from 1999 to 2003. Data were collected restrospectively from hospital and office records. RESULTS We observed 42 male patients, 69 patients were C variety, all had more than 12 h of postnatal life, 34 were preterm newborn, 41 were classified A or B according to Waterston, and 41 died. A logistic regression analysis and chi2 of the influence of each risk factor on mortality was performed. Relevant statistical significance was found in the studied variables. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality of esophageal atresia was higher due to identified risk factors.</dc:description>
