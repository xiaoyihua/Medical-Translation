<dc:description xml:lang="en">The literature contains a large number of published articles indicating a strong relationship between obesity and morbidity-mortality due to different cause. There are also various short- to medium-term studies demonstrating the benefits of a moderate weight loss on the control of obesity-related risk factors. Nonetheless, very few studies have attempted to define the potential medium- to long-term morbidity/mortality benefits associated with weight loss using conventional obesity treatment methods. This review attempts to weigh up the benefits and also the risks associated with the methods currently recognized for the treatment of this pathology. We also attempt to analyze the efficacy of these methods for controlling body weight in the medium and long term, as this is essential when it comes to advising the obese population.</dc:description>
