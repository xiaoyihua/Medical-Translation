<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this paper is to reveal the impact that our online methodology is having around not only in quality culture but also in health care training. In Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR) Health Sciences School, we have a great interest in offering professional training to meet society demands. Since 2014, several degrees related to quality health care have been developed. Online higher education is contributing significantly to the culture of quality. The concern for the quality in health care has been around for ages, as much as the own exercise of medicine, there are many variables involved (scientific and technical aspects such as diagnosis, treatment, prevention and rehabilitation). Our master degree in «Seguridad clínica del paciente y gestión de la calidad asistencial» provides practical training through virtual face-to-face workshops, improving professional skills in the field of public health and quality patient health care. Communication skills are developed for the management of teams in crisis, epidemiology studies and appropriate risk management measures are developed for implementation in different health organizations. The online teaching methodology is having a great impact in disseminating patient safety culture, being accessible to all health specialties and allowing for excellent access to information and knowledge, wich is constantly growing. In addition, the master degree in «Cuidados Paliativos Pediátricos» provides training in care to all pediatric patients, either in the terminal situation or with a deadly disease. These skills aim to improve care and quality of life for these patients (infants, children and teenagers) and their families, in a comprehensive and personalized way, guaranteeing respect for their dignity and the right to their autonomy. In these degrees, the purpose, besides the training in equipping health management tools for staff, is to focus medical and nurse training on care quality, understood as offering a comprehensive, personalized and rigorous service to achieve the objectives of Health. CONCLUSIONS: Our online higher education approach is having a great interest and impact improving health care and patient safety. The accessibility of this methodology and the closeness with teachers through virtual face-to-face classes and forums, combined with clinical practices, is postulated as a new teaching model to spread culture of quality in medical education. Seminars or day-conferences are held on specific topics to encourage professional relationships. Some health management models that are proposed are common to our degrees taught for international experts shaping a very specialized area of knowledge around the management of the health care quality (AU)</dc:description>
