<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dysmorphophobia, also known as Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), can become a serious illness that results in severe complications such as social isolation, self-mutilations, suicide attempts, and even suicide. Many authors currently include BDD among the spectrum of obsessive-compulsive disorders. There are two distinguishable variants of BDD: psychotic and non-psychotic. The current trend considers these variants as one same disorder characterized by an insight spectrum. However, the psychotic variant exhibits more severe symptoms. We present a case of dysmorphophobia with psychotic symptoms that required psychiatric hospitalization due to serious complications. We discuss the presence of tactile and propioceptive sensations in some BDD patients and their contribution to their distress. Finally, we discuss a great propensity of BDD patients to conceal their symptoms. Thus, it is important for the clinician to specifically inquire about these symptoms, especially in high-risk groups, to prevent occurrence of serious complications.</dc:description>
