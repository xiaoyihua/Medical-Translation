<dc:description xml:lang="en">This article analyses the use of healthcare services in Catalonia with reference to their variability and cross-territory healthcare flows. The coefficients of variation show a lower degree of territorial dispersion in acute-care and primary-care hospitalisation, and a greater degree in social-healthcare. In the territorial analysis of the penetration indices, five large attraction poles are salient. There is no significant association among healthcare flows between the specialised healthcare given in acute healthcare hospitals, mental healthcare and social-healthcare, whereas a strong association was observed between the set of services associated to the acute-care hospital structure (hospitalisation, outpatient service and emergency care) and also among the social healthcare internment services (medium and long-term stays). This would seem to suggest that the association between flows refers to services that are habitually rendered from one single healthcare mechanism, and not so much to a pattern of cross-territory relations.</dc:description>
