<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors reviewed all lymphoproliferative lesions involving the gastrointestinal tract diagnosed at the Centro de Salud Zenón J. Santillán Hospital, Department of Pathology, during the period (1963-1985). The histopathology of 16 lymphomas and pseudolymphomas have been studied, comparing the morphological and immunological findings. The lymphomas were reviewed by application of the Int. Working Formulation. The occurrence was 5 in the stomach, 3 in the small intestine, 4 in the large intestine and 2 in Waldeyer's Ring. In one necropsy case, multiple sites in the gastrointestinal tract were involved. In one other case the localization was only esophagic. In every case the various pathological forms of the associated mucosal changes, the localization and the depth of wall invasion were also recorded. In 4 cases (3 lymphomas and 1 pseudolymphoma) we were able to use the sections for immunohistochemical studies, which were found to be very useful as a complement to light microscopy.</dc:description>
