<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Our aim is to describe the environmental aspects of children between 0 and 24 months, who arrived in the Emergency Department of the Hospital General de Cataluña and Hospital Parc Tauli (both within Barcelona province), and were diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis from November 2010 to February 2011. METHOD A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on children of both sexes, with ages from 0 to 24 months, and diagnosed with bronchiolitits respiratory syncytial virus +. Data was obtained by completing a non-validated questionnaire, with information provided by parents and the medical history. RESULTS The most common features in the study were: a mean age of 3.8 months, most were males, with siblings of school age, mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy, were in a non-smoking environment in their home, and finally, less than 5 people living together in their home. CONCLUSIONS The most common risk factors n order of prevalence were, having siblings of school age, male sex, and living in smoking environment. It was observed that the majority of children had risk associated factors associated, with only 8.2% of samples not presenting any risk factors.</dc:description>
