<dc:description xml:lang="en">For several decades the study of hypertension has been the subject of special attention in the arterial hypertension units and there has been a continuous search for different organizational models in order to improve diagnostic and therapeutic efficiency. The duty assigned to the cardiologist in each health area, according to the new model regulated by the Spanish health authority, and as a result of new scientific developments, convert him into a principal health agent in the fields of hypertension and risk factors. According to our organizational scheme the treatment of the hypertensive patient is undertaken in the preventive cardiology outpatient unit in conjunction with other hospital medical branches and the Family physician. This is backed up by a nursing team that selects the patients on entrance and carries out routine post-therapy.</dc:description>
