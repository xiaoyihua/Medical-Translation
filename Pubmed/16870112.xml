<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION A solid perspective is the result of knowledge building and constitutes a stance of the teacher on education. OBJECTIVES To explore if there is a stance on education among professors in the health area and to investigate if teaching education has an influence on it, as well as if there is any relation-ship between stance and academic level in teaching. MATERIAL AND METHODS A census was made among teachers in the medical units of the health area in Guadalajara. The sample was constituted by 126 professors, who accepted to fill out the questionnaire. To explore the stance, an instrument was made from the passive and participative perspectives of education. The items were grouped in pairs: two statements that approach the same topic from opposing points of view. The criterion of obtaining an indiscriminate agreement of 0.50 or lower and a consequence of 0.50 or higher was established to consider the existence of a stance. Once the measurement was made, the professors' results were compared, taking into account the precedent of teaching background and academic level of educational practice. RESULTS no existence of a stance was certified in any of the individuals. The results did not show any significant differences in any of the contrasting events. CONCLUSIONS The predominance of the passive perspective shows an absence of a stance in the group. It is necessary to create educational spaces that bring about a stance in teachers that give greater consistence, scope and direction to their educational performance.</dc:description>
