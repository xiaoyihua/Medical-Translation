<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Positive results in infections of borrelia burgdorferi and Rickettsia conorii in human and canine population is studied in order to understand the situation of both in humans, and at the same time discover the importance of the dog as an indicator of these agents among those in the Health Area of San Andrés del Rabanedo, León. METHODS A study was made of 98 human serums and 95 canine serums (dogs of different breeds and capabilities) as regards B. burgdorferi (positive results 1/128 and 1/64, respectively) and 104 human serums and 84 canine serums as regards R. conorii (positive results at range 1/64 in both species) by means of indirect Immunofluorescence (IFI). RESULTS Positivity in both infections was discovered in both humans and dogs. With regard to B burgdorferi it was higher in humans than in dogs and with regard to R. conorii it was higher in dogs than in humans. In humans it was 4.08% as regards B. burgdorferi and 1% with respect to R. conorii: in dogs it was 2.10% as regards B. burgdorferi and 14.28% regarding R. conorii. The highest values were discovered in the Spring-Summer months except in the case of B. burgdorferi in dogs. Serum prevalence was greater in dogs used to guard other animals (sheep) than those involved in hunting and security. CONCLUSIONS The percentages of positive results discovered in our work, in humans as well as dogs, estimated in the territorial area of a geographical zone in a semi-rural León province, were equal or inferior to those discovered in other provinces, including ours. In dogs there were larger positive results regarding R. conorii than B. burgdorferi, which indicates that it is the most extended agent within our Province, as other authors have pointed out. The values discovered in humans as regards B. burgdorferi were higher than those in dogs; the existence of reactions crossed with other microorganisms may have influenced these results. For this reason, we consider it necessary to conduct more studies on the prevalence to these infections to obtain an appropriate epidemiological surveillance and control of these zoonosis, given their impact on public health.</dc:description>
