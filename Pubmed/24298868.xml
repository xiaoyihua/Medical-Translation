<dc:description xml:lang="en">Micronuclei are structures similar to a nucleus but small size and localized in the cytoplasm. A micronucleus contents chromosome fragments or whole chromosomes. The micronucleus test is considered a biomarker for early induced genetic damage. Micronucleus test with cytochalasin B (CBMN test) is used to evaluate genotoxic effects induced by physical and chemical environmental agents, and to estimate the genetic damage induced in population groups exposed to such agents. After the study of large groups of control population, it is estimated that CBMN test can be used as a marker of health status with ability to establish a cancer risk. Finally, recent studies about the onset of cancer, based on single catastrophic events able to originate a cancer, such as chromothripsis or chromoanagenesis, are going to understand through an anomalous replication of DNA within the micronucleus.</dc:description>
