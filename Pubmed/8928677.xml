<dc:description xml:lang="en">As years go by during the last quarter of the 19th Century, the number of Spanish specialists devoted to the "urinary tract" or to the "disorders of the genitourinary organs" increased gradually. The first generation of specialists (Martra, Suender and Rodríguez Viforcos, among others) are mainly professionals who studied in Paris or other European clinics and who preferentially use the techniques of transurethral surgery: lithotrity and litholapaxy, catheterism, dilations, uretrotomy, etc. as well as minor operations on the genitalia, occasionally performing some major procedures such as perineal dissection. Many of them also become experts in Dermatology and Syphiliography. Until progress of anaesthetics and surgical techniques in the last decade of the century, do not allow to conduct more risked procedures, urology surgery of greater substance will continue in the hands of general surgeons who retain a certain degree of specialization in the urinary tract. Only after the arrival to Spain of the second generation of specialists (Azcarreta, Lluria y Despau, Suarez de Mendoza, Mollá y Rodrigo, etc.), equipped with greater preparation and more advanced surgical training, the Spanish Urology will accomplish the desired position required for its ultimate segregation from General Surgery.</dc:description>
