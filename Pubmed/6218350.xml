<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thirty six patients affected of acne vulgaris, preferently inflammatory, graded from I to IV according to Plewig &amp; Kligman scale, were included in a double blind trial of erythromycin laurilsulfate (A-137) alcoholic solution versus only the vehicle, both for topical. The solutions were assigned after randomisation and both groups were found to be statistically comparable in what concerned to age, sex and length of the disease and initial number of the different lesions. The treatment has been carried over 8 weeks, the solution was applied 3 times daily and controls were made fortnightly. It was assessed: a) Individual count of lesions existing in one side of the face; b) Grade of severity (I to IV); c) Frontal and lateral colour pictures; d) Overall opinion of patient. The statistical analysis of results shows significant differences between both groups in behalf of A-137 in the following parameters: number of closed comedones in the 2nd week (P less than 0,05), in closed comedones (P less than 0,05) and pustules (P less than 0,005) during the 4th week, in the number of pustules (P less than 0,025) during the 6th week and in closed comedones (P less than 0,05), papules (P less than 0,05) and pustules (P less than 0,0,25) at the end of the 8 weeks treatment. The severity grade was equally lower (P less than 0,025) in the A-137 group on the 8th week. There were no intolerance phenomena reported nor any kind of unwanted side effects during the study.</dc:description>
