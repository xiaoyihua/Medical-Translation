<dc:description xml:lang="en">The transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap has been the most employed technique in autogenous breast reconstruction. It provides a new breast of adequate volume, ptosis and natural appearance, and does not require the implantation of prosthesis; a good symmetry with the contralateral breast is obtained, which lasts over time. The drawback of this technique is the morbidity of the abdominal wall. This flap sacrifices the muscle and the anterior rectus sheath which can result in consequences such as hernias and eventrations. To minimise this problem the microsurgical TRAM flap was developed, which only sacrifices a portion of muscle, significantly reducing the number of sequels. A drawback is the difficulty of the surgical technique, which requires mastery of vascular-nervous microsurgery. In conclusion, a new breast can be returned to the mastectomised woman in a completely autogenous way, with a volume, form and texture similar to the healthy side, which helps in short to recover lost self-esteem.</dc:description>
