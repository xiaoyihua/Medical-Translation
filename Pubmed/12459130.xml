<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM Burnout syndrome refers to a kind of occupational stress that can have psychosomatic, behavioral, emotional, familial, and social repercussions; it can also cause absenteeism and loss of efficacy at work. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of burnout among staff in a district hospital, as well as the personal and working characteristics associated with the syndrome. METHODS A cross-sectional study was designed in which a representative random sample of 300 workers, stratified according to professional group, was given the Maslach Burnout Inventory to measure the degree of burnout. This questionnaire has three subscales: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP) and personal achievement (PA). RESULTS A high degree of burnout was found for EE in 13.9% of the staff interviewed, in 11.1% for DP and in 6.6% for PA. None of the interviewees had high scores for all three scales while 27% had a high level of burnout in at least one of the scales. In the multivariate analysis, professional category and sex were statistically significantly associated with a high level of burnout. CONCLUSION The prevalence of burnout in Mataró Hospital (Spain) is relatively low and depends mainly on sex and professional group.</dc:description>
