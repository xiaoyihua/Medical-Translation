<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To identify the factors associated with growth and development monitoring (CRED) fulfillment for children &lt;1 year in Ministry of Health (MINSA) health centers in Amazonas, Loreto, and Pasco, Peru between January and December 2012. MATERIALS AND METHODS A paired case-control study was performed. A case was the child who did not complete 11 of the CRED checks until the age of 11 months and, as a control, that child with 11 CRED checks with the same age. The correlation among factors with CRED fulfillment was determined using the McNemar test (p &lt; 0.05) and odds ratio (OR) was used to determine the strength of the associations for paired samples (95% confidence interval [CI]). RESULTS After the control of various variables, seven factors had significant association with CRED monitoring fulfillment. The common factor in the three regions studied was that the child were not attended some time, which was associated, three to five times, with the chance of not fulfilling the CRED checks in Loreto and Pasco; in Amazonas, the opposite effect was observed (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.41-0.81). CONCLUSIONS The factors related to CRED fulfillment in children &lt;1 year of age varied among regions. One of the main identified obstacles is the multiple functions that must be performed by professionals working in CRED, owing to which, child care opportunities are lost. Hence, adequate staffing must be ensured while instilling ever-present proper patient treatment.</dc:description>
