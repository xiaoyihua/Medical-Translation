<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In Colombia, breastfeeding is inadequate and -especially in teenage girls- short. Given that adolescents are a social group with their own lifestyles, we need to know what meanings they have regarding breastfeeding, and also what the characteristics of their breastfeeding experience are, in order to identify issues that limit or facilitate this practice, which will produce the knowledge to improve breastfeeding promotion strategies. OBJECTIVE To characterize the experience of breastfeeding in nursing adolescents and identify strengths, limitations and perceived needs from their own perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a phenomenological qualitative study. We conducted 24 interviews and had three focal groups with female adolescents in different postpartum periods. Data collection was carried out in Bogotá, with women participating in a program of the Secretaría Distrital de Integración Social. The systematic process was developed in parallel with the analysis process. It involved the relationships between categories and the networks that form among them. RESULTS Teenagers do not breastfeed exclusively, identifying several difficulties in the act of breastfeeding. Complementary feeding includes unnatural foods. Maternity and breastfeeding are not consistent with the perception of being a teenager. CONCLUSIONS Adolescents recognize the benefits of breastfeeding for their children and for them; however, their breastfeeding experience differs from the recommendations to achieve exclusive breastfeeding and a healthy complementary feeding. Among the identified causes, we highlight the lack of accurate backing and timely support.</dc:description>
