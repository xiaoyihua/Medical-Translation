<dc:title xml:lang="en">Coral and the reasons of her heart: from addiction to creativity</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">The analytic process with, adolescents generally involves a pathway where experiences of immediacy, necessity and urgency are mixed with feelings of passivity. Consequently, one of the tasks will be to help the young person to think about his or her identity and a future that has meaning. However, when there has been an excess of paraexcitation, this can lead to a deficit in representation, so the experience of being alone becomes traumatic, or being together with the other is not possible without being glued to it. This paper presents the treatment of an adolescent over several years, during which time the patients need of various addictive objects and her need for containment through different channels may be seen: emails, telephone, sessions; as well as the progressive change by means of the representation and working through of traumatic situations linked to her infantile sexuality to possibilities for expression of her psychic life and emotional experiences, through the word and other means of artistic expression (AU)</dc:description>
