<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To measure the quality of life of asthmatic children and to find their social and health situation. DESIGN Transversal, descriptive study. SETTING Cadiz health centre with a population of 3680 children. PARTICIPANTS Fifty two children included in the asthma programme. MAIN MEASUREMENTS The data were collected in 2004 from the clinical histories of the Andalusian Health Service and through personal interviews using the PAQLQ quality of life questionnaire. Social-demographic, clinical, service-use, and quality-of-life variables were collected. Version 11.0 of the SPSS programme was used for the analysis. RESULTS There were more boys (65.4%). The social-demographic profile found that 80.6% were in nuclear families and 75% had absence of damp at home. The asthma background was 17.3% in fathers and 25% in mothers. Of active smokers, 57.7% were fathers and 42.3% were mothers. Mean annual consultations in primary care were 5.5+/-4.6 in total and 1.5+/-2.5 for asthma. The mean score on the quality-of-life questionnaire was 5.5+/-1.3, and in its various dimensions: restriction on physical activity, 5.3+/-1.6; symptoms, 5.5+/-1.3; and emotional aspects, 5.6+/-1.4. CONCLUSIONS The population of asthmatic children included in the asthma programme have a good quality of life, especially in the emotional dimension. The social and health situation, clinical status and the quality-of-life score are very homogeneous.</dc:description>
