<dc:description xml:lang="en">The research of the origin and development of the Medicalhyphen;surgical specialties in our environment has been, to my knowledge, limited. The aim of this work is to review it in reference to Urology, one of the first specialties developed in Mallorca during the second half of the XIX Century and the beginning of the XX century. Evidence acquisition has been performed through research of the archives of the Royal Academy of Medicine of the Balearic Islands (RAMIB) and the Medical College and the study of the Balearic Journal of Medical sciences. Furthermore, the biographies of the main precursors and pioneers of Urology in Mallorca have been reconstructed.</dc:description>
