<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Asthma is an inflammatory chronic illness, in which mastocyt cells, basophils, T lymphocytes, eosinophils and cytokines play a role. Its association with the production of TH2 cytokines is not well known, but it is considered an aberrant immune response, yielding the activation and recruitment of a number of effector cells (mastocyts/eosinophils) and the appearance of clinical symptoms. OBJECTIVE To determine the serum values of the interleukins 2, 4, 5, 6 and 12 and gamma interferon in relation to the severity degree of asthma and the time of immunotherapy in patients with stable chronic allergic bronchial asthma. MATERIAL AND METHODS Clinical records of allergic asthmatic patients from the external consultation at Servicio de Alergia e Immunología Clínica were reviewed in a period of 12 months (1st January 2002 to 1st January 2003) and those of healthy volunteers, forming three groups: Group 1, allergic asthmatics with immunotherapy less than 24 months; Group 2, allergic asthmatics with more than 24 months of immunotherapy, and Group 3, healthy volunteers (control group). Previous informed consent, a serum sample was taken of all subjects. RESULTS Ninety-two subjects were included: 41 (45%) allergic asthmatics and 51 (55%) healthy volunteers. Significant differences were found in interleukins 2, 4, 5, 6 and 12 levels between healthy volunteers and asthmatics without relating the immunotherapy time. In the total group gamma interferon levels were not found. A relation of interleukins Th2 levels with the severity degree of asthma was not found. Differences of serum interleukins Th1 and Th2 in allergic patients related to immunotherapy time were not significant; even though, irrespective of immunotherapy time, IgG levels were always high. CONCLUSIONS Patients with allergic asthma have a predominance of serum interleukins Th2 and, despite of the immunotherapy, in the maintaining phase, these continue high, which may be due to an immune system dysregulation maybe including other factors. Immunotherapy continues being one of the most useful specific treatments in allergic diseases, demonstrated by its satisfactory clinical response, reduced drugs' use and modification in severity and evolution of the disease.</dc:description>
