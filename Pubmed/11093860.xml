<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To review the clinical findings of pancreatic tuberculosis and to establish a differential diagnosis with pancreatic tumours. PATIENTS AND METHODS To describe three cases of pancreatic tuberculosis diagnosed in a 850 bed teaching hospital during the last two years. RESULTS In the three case the imaging procedures showed a pancreatic mass with hypodense area. One of the cases was erroneously initially diagnosed of a pancreatic tumour. In one case was diagnosed by a subcutaneous abscess puncture, in another by clinical suspicion and in third patient by laparotomy. Only one patient was immunosuppressed. All patients were cured with standard antituberculous therapy. CONCLUSIONS Pancreatic tuberculosis should be considered in patients presenting with pancreatic tumours.</dc:description>
