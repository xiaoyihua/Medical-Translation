<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Chronic cocaine users develop multiple potentially lethal ischemic vascular complications associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. AIM To assess biochemical and lipid profiles among cocaine dependent subjects in recent abstinence. MATERIAL AND METHODS A blood sample to measure blood count, biochemical and lipid profiles was obtained from 78 patients aged 19 to 53 years (78% males) who complied with DSM-IV criteria for cocaine dependency. Laboratory results were compared with a group of normal subjects. RESULTS All cases had positive urinary cocaine, with a mean consumption lapse of 7.6 years. The frequency of smoking was higher in cases. Dependent males had higher body mass index than controls. Compared to controls, dependent females had significantly higher triglyceride (TG) levels and lower HDL cholesterol. Therefore the relation total/HDL cholesterol was higher (p = 0.0365). Dependent males had higher TG levels than their normal counterparts. Dependent subjects consuming cocaine base-paste had higher TG levels. Total proteins, albumin, urea and blood urea nitrogen were lower in dependent subjects. Among males, serum creatinine was lower and blood urea was positively correlated with the daily amount of cocaine use (p = 0.03). After a month of strict abstinence, lipid profile was repeated in 27 patients and remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS Chronic cocaine use was associated with higher TG in both genders and lower HDL cholesterol in women when compared with a group of healthy counterparts.</dc:description>
