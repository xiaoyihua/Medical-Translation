<dc:description xml:lang="en">A study was made of the effect of rice chaff oil (ASA) on gastroduodenal ulcer (UGD) induced by different techniques: cysteaminium chloride, indomethacin, artificial gastric juices and stress (acidity, histamine, pepsin and volume of gastric juice were evaluated). For each technique the same protocol was followed: four days before the experiment 20 Wistar rats (180-220 g) were divided into a control group (0.2 ml/day of saline solution per os) and a treated group (0.2 ml/day of oral rice chaff oil). After quantitation of the ulcers and statistical analysis of the data, the ulcer index was found to be smaller in the treated group than in controls, both for stress ulcers (p less than 0.01) and for those induced by indomethacin (p less than 0.001) and artificial gastric juice (p less than 0.001). As for the cysteaminium chloride technique, an evaluation was made of the ulcer per se and the inflammatory halo; in both cases there were significant differences (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01 respectively) between the treated group and controls. No significant differences were found on comparing the values off histamine, pepsin and the volume of gastric juices, but there were differences in hydrogen ion concentration (p less than 0.05). An analysis is made of the physiologic aspects studied in each technique, emphasizing the possible implication of prostaglandins (PG) and alpha-tocopherol after treatment with rice chaff oil.</dc:description>
