<dc:description xml:lang="en">In 1954 the Postgraduate School of the University of Chile initiated the programmed training of medical specialists and continuous medical education. The National Health Service, in cooperation with the University, granted 2-3 year fellowships for medical graduates or for physicians who had previously worked 3 to 5 years in National Health Service hospitals around the country. In 1981, a new University law oriented to the decentralization of these institutions, established that postgraduate programs would be under direct control of each Medical School (6 in all). Since then, an increasing number of graduates, a decrease in the number of postgraduate training programs and a deterioration of training centers has been observed. Some continuous medical education and specialization programs are carried out/by independent organizations, not necessarily related to the medical schools. Moreover, important changes in health and economic policies have occurred in the country and financial resources for the specialization of physicians are limited. Urgent action of institutions with a responsibility for post-graduate training, with cooperation of private sectors, is needed to revert this critical problem.</dc:description>
