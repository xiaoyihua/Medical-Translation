<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Hypertension is an important public health problem in Colombia. One of the principal reasons for the poor effectiveness of interventions is the lack of knowledge and understanding of beliefs about this disease and its treatment. OBJECTIVE Profiles were determined for the atitudes, knowledge and beliefs of patients about antihypertensive drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS In a sample of 202 hypertensive patients from a private clinical center in Bogotá, Colombia, the beliefs, knowledge and attitudes about antihypertensive treatment was determined by the use of Morisky-Green test, and Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire. RESULTS Of these patients, 48% forgot to take the prescribed medication occasionally, 68% believed that if doctors had more time with patients, they will prescribe fewer medicines, and 40% did not know what physiological systems can be damaged by hypertension. CONCLUSION This study reinforces the necessity of improving the communication strategies of health professionals in the support of a positive clinician-patient relationship.</dc:description>
