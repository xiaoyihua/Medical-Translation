<dc:description xml:lang="en">Primordial germ cells (PGC) are a population of cells characterised by a positive reaction to alkaline phosphatase, usually present in the mouse embryo at 7.5 days post coitus (dpc). These cells migrate through various tissues before they become incorporated into the gonadal ridges. Hematopoiesis is a complex developmental system in which the hemopoietic stem cells (HSC) were experimentally shown to have been derived from a single multipotent stem cell. PGC, as well as HSC are regulated by a range of growth factors that control both proliferative and differentiative processes. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a cytokine that regulates the differentiation and the totipotentional phenotype of PGC. Recently, other growth factors, such as stem cell factor (SCF), macrophage growth factor (MGF), and forskolin (FRKL) have been proposed as the possible in vivo and in vitro regulators for PGCs and HSCs. Induction of hematopoiesis in an embryonic germ cell derived from PGCs indicates that germ cells acquire the potentiality to differentiate toward hematopoietic cells. The coincidental presence of both PGCs and HSCs at the sites where early hemopoiesis is established, together with similar growth factor requirements support the hypothesis that PGCs may also be considered hemopoiesis initiating cells.</dc:description>
