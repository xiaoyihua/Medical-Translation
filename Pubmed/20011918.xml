<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The objective of this study was to estimate the difference between perceived norms for drug use among university students and their peers, with ages between 18 and 24 years, and attending education and health courses. This cross-sectional study was based on a survey and an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS in total, 365 students participated. The rates for drug use over the last year were as follows: 43.6% for tobacco; 96.2% for alcohol; 8.2% for marijuana; and 2.2% for cocaine. The perceived norm for drug use over the last year was 78.9% for tobacco, 88.3% for alcohol, 35.4% for marijuana and 20.9% for cocaine. The consumption of alcoholic beverages and the perceived norm were very close, but it was overestimated for tobacco use. Regarding access to drugs being easy or very easy on campus, access to cigarettes and cocaine was underestimated, while marijuana was overestimated. CONCLUSIONS university students overestimate the use of tobacco, marijuana and cocaine by their peers and have a correct perception of alcohol use. Tobacco is the substance with the most overestimated use.</dc:description>
