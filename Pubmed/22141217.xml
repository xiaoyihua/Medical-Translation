<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Total knee replacement causes moderate to severe postoperative pain. The aim of this trial was to compare postoperative analgesia from a fascia iliaca compartment block to continuous epidural analgesia following knee arthroplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS Clinical trial enrolling patients in American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classes 1 to 3 randomized to 2 groups. One group received spinal anesthesia plus a fascia iliaca compartment block with 0.1% bupivacaine at a rate of 10 mL/h. The second group received combined spinal-epidural anesthesia plus epidural analgesia with 0.1% bupivacaine in continuous infusion at a rate of 8 mL/h. Postoperative pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and on movement was recorded every 3 hours for the first 24 hours. Use of intravenous morphine and the adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS Forty patients (20 for each group) were enrolled. The distribution of age, weight, body mass index, sex, ASA class, duration of surgery, use of morphine, and the incidence of adverse effects were similar in the 2 groups. Postoperative VAS scores at rest and on movement were also similar. The incidence of arterial hypotension was higher in the epidural analgesia group. CONCLUSIONS The fascia iliaca compartment block and continuous epidural infusion are similarly efficient in providing postoperative analgesia for patients after total knee replacement. The fascia iliaca compartment block is associated with a lower incidence of postoperative hemodynamic complications. Early, safe rehabilitation is facilitated by both analgesic techniques.</dc:description>
