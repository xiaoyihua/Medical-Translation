<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report one case of supernumerary testicle, a rare entity with around 100 cases published. METHODS 44-year-old male patient consulting for incidental discovering of a right scrotal mass. The diagnosis of polyorchidism was suspected after physical examination, ultrasound, and CT scan, and confirmed subsequently on surgical exploration and biopsy. Due to the absence of pathology and complete normal seminal lines decision was taken to not perform orchiectomy of the supernumerary testicle. RESULTS There are classifications for proper evaluation of polyorchidism, which state the relation between site of the testicle in relation to scrotum, existence or absence of independent epididymis and vasa deferentia for both testicles. CONCLUSIONS Although remotely, there is a possibility of malignant degeneration of these testicles, so that surgical exploration and excision of the supernumerary testicles when their biopsy is doubtful in terms of dysplasia or if they present carcinoma in situ or they are a source of pain.</dc:description>
