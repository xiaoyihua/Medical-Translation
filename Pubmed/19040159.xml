<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES This paper aims to evaluate the clinical and diagnostic usefulness of uro MRI, to show the study technique and to establish correlations of some of its results with conventional intravenous urography (IVU). Frequency and prevalence by age and gender of pathologies were evaluated. METHODS We studied a total of 58 patients, 31 females and 27 males, with an age range between 22-92 years. All patients underwent uro MRI between April 2003 and January 2005. We perform a double-blind study with those patients undergoing conventional IVU before uro MRI. RESULTS The total number of patients evaluated was 58, 35 of which present more than 1 concurrent pathology 17.2% (n=10) of the studies were normal, five males and five females, with an age range between 22 and 83 years, and a mean age of 46.1 years. IVU was diagnostic for 100% and 83.3% of A and B observers respectively; uro MRI was diagnostic for 50% and 0% respectively. Ureteral lithiasis showed a result of 50% and 100% for IVU; uro MRI had a 75% for both observers. In cases of double pyelocalyceal system both methods have a 100% accordance between both observers. In bladder cancer, uro MRI was diagnostic in 100% and IVU in 0% for both observers. CONCLUSIONS The most frequent concurrent pathology was cystic renal disease, and the second was urolithiasis with urinary tract dilation. Uro MRI was superior to see bladder and pyeloureteral pathologies, but in cases of renal lithiasis and urinary tract calcifications IVU is the test of choice yet.</dc:description>
