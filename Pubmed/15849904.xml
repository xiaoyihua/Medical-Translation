<dc:description xml:lang="en">A study of 404 women that attended the Microbiology Laboratory of Ramón Gonzalez Coro Gynecoobstetric Hospital, in Havana City, was conducted aimed at identifying species of yeasts isolated from Pap smears, registering the signs and clinical symptoms and determining the risk factors associated with infection. The isolated yeasts were identified by the filamentation tests in serum, production of chlamydoconidia and carbohydrate assimilation. It was found that 138 (34.16%) of women had yeasts in the vagina. 3 genera were identified: Candida (88.49%). Trichosporon (10.79%) and Rhodotorula (0.72%). Pruritus and heat showed statistical significance (p &lt; 0.01). Pregnancy, the use of IUD and the antibacterial therapy proved to be the most common risk factors in relation to the presence of Candida in the vagina.</dc:description>
