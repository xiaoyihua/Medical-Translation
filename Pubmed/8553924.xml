<dc:description xml:lang="en">The subject is discourse; such discourse is far from a simple point of encounter (or disencounter) between a language, a significant system, and a wild, virginal reality that is distant from any word. Farm from being a mere actualization of a group of signs used to indicate "things per se-, to represent a reality that now, beforehand, and regardless of the language describes it as such, has a mute sense that awaits the moment of its expression; far from being, I say, words, mere words that fall softly on things to me them, transform them, form them? it regularly constitutes what is spoken. Thus discourse is something more, it does more than indicate, name, translate, express ... it produces reality; moreover, of this is the case, in theoretical knowledge, theory is not neutral or disinterested contemplation, but productive power, poetry... Therefore, the effects of discourse rather than its causes are what are expressed and what interests this philosopher is the action of Foucault's discourse, inasmuch as its practice is characterized by a group of hierarchical rules.</dc:description>
