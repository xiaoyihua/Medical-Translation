<dc:description xml:lang="en">The life expectancy of patients with schizophrenia (SCH) is 11 to 20 years less than the general population. There is an association between SCH and various diseases and chronic conditions, highlighting the cardio-metabolic diseases. This association has been attributed to the use of antipsychotics, however, evidence has also shown intrinsic susceptibility of schizophrenic patients the development of chronic conditions. This review aims to update knowledge about chronic conditions such as cardiometabolic risk and sleep, bone and kidney disorders related to SCH. These patients have a high prevalence of risk behaviors, including smoking and poor diet. They have a worse metabolic profile than the general population and a greater likelihood of developing metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. SCH has also been associated with other chronic diseases such as osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease. The high prevalence of these comorbidities in schizophrenic population is not explained solely by the antipsychotic treatment, therefore intrinsic mechanisms associated to SCH are postulated to be associated with these conditions. This new information requires a change in the multidisciplinary medical approach for the study and management of schizophrenic patients.</dc:description>
