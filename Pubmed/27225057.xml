<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE We report two cases of patients with a previous diagnosis of hematologic tumor who present with testicular recurrence, and we carry out a review of the literature regarding the infrequency of this pathology. METHODS We present a retrospective review of the medical records of two patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies (acute myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma) with occurrence of relapse in the testicle. We reviewed the management and outcome after treatment with bilateral orchiectomy. RESULTS Case 1: The patient was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and treated with an allogeneic transplant. Two years later, the patient reported an increase in testicular size. The complementary studies lead us to suspect a testicular recurrence that was confirmed after orchiectomy. Currently, the patient awaits the start of a chemotherapy treatment prior to a new allogeneic transplant. Case 2: Patient with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma who started a polychemotherapy treatment without response and underwent allogeneic transplant. After five months with complete remission, there were signs of systemic recurrence, and a study for a new transplant was carried out. During the study, potential testicular recurrence was observed. After a batch of complementary tests, bilateral orchiectomy was performed and the diagnosis was confirmed. Currently, the patient is undergoing an allogeneic transplant protocol after radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment. CONCLUSIONS Currently the mortality rate in cases of relapse of hematologic malignancy in the testicle has declined despite the sharp rise in its incidence. This is because of, as in our case, early diagnosis and the combined use of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. This has been achieved through an interdisciplinary collaboration of urologists, hematologists, oncologists and radiotherapists.</dc:description>
