<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Although analyses have been done on the publishing of scientific articles on pain in Spanish, book publications in the field have not been studied. This article fills that gap. MATERIAL AND METHODS A bibliography of books with pain approached from a medical standpoint was compiled from ISBN CD-ROM database (updated for 1993). Books going into more than one edition were considered single titles. Multi-volume collections were considered single books. We analyzed type of book, subject, ISBN classification, year, language (of publication and original), publisher and place of publication. RESULTS Two hundred books were studied. Over 60% had been published within the previous 10 years. The year that showed the most books published was 1990 (19) followed by 1989 (16) and 1988 (16). Output has been rising steadily. One hundred ninety-eight books were published in Spanish and 2 in Catalan. The original language was Spanish in 114 cases, English in 51 cases, French in 21 and German in 7. By ISBN classification, most (146) covered pathology, disease and medical/therapeutic clinical practice. By topic, 51 books were general, 41 treated lumbalgia, sciatica or back pain and 35 covered headaches in general or migraine. Most of the books were issued by trade publishers. The cities most often involved were Barcelona and Madrid. CONCLUSIONS An increased number of books about pain are being published in Spain, coinciding with a rise in the publication of scientific articles on the subject.</dc:description>
