<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To examine the use of extra-hospital emergency systems in the urgent care of stroke patients in our region and their influence on the time required to reach hospital, the time needed to perform an urgent computerised axial tomography (CAT) scan and the delay in receiving attention from the specialist. PATIENTS AND METHODS Samples were collected from 232 stroke patients out of the total number admitted to our hospitals. Data about the stroke were collected prospectively, and included the arrival time, the time required to perform the CAT scan and the time the specialist devoted to attending the patient. Data were also gathered about the different extra-hospital transport and emergency systems. A statistical analysis was performed to determine the effect of using the extra-hospital emergency procedures on the different variables. RESULTS A total of 53.6% of patients arrived within the first three hours. 38.7% went straight to hospital, 25% visited extra-hospital Emergency Services first, and 18.5% made a prior visit to Primary Care. 51.5% found their own way to the hospital and 46.7% arrived by ambulance. Mean time taken to perform an urgent CAT scan: 190.4 minutes; mean time required for specialist attention: 25.65 hours. The only statistically significant relation was the use of extra-hospital emergency systems and health care transport according to the type of stroke: both were more likely to be used in cases of haemorrhagic stroke. CONCLUSIONS In hospitals in the Murcia region, the use of the extra-hospital emergency system and the means of transport utilised do not affect the time stroke patients take to reach hospital or the time needed to perform an urgent CAT scan or the delay in receiving attention from a specialist; the aetiology of the stroke does, however, influence the use of such services.</dc:description>
