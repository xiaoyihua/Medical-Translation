<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The frequency of congenital defects is not the same in different populations and ethnic groups. Genetic factors, as well as differences in socio-cultural aspects (such as the frequency of consanguineous couples) between the groups could be responsible for some differences in the prevalence of congenital anomalies. However, some groups are made up of populations which live on the fringe of society in which several circumstances and related factors could increase the risk for congenital defects. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 24,696 malformed infants were studied together with a similar group of controls, separated into the following ethnic groups: Gypsies, black, orientals, Arabic people and whites. Using different models of logistic regression analysis, controlling several factors related to the social-cultural level and with genetic aspects (such as consanguinity), we estimated the risk for 20 different congenital defects in the ethnic groups compared to the white population. RESULTS The analysis showed that some ethnic groups have an increased risk for some congenital defects and that this increased risk is due to their high level of consanguinity. Other defects are due to different factors related with the low socio-cultural level. However, in black and Arabic people there is a high risk for some congenital defects that is not attributable to those genetic or socio-cultural factors studied. CONCLUSIONS The results of the present study permit the estimation of the impact of congenital defects in these groups that have low socio-cultural level, as well as the need for health care. This is of great usefulness in establishing the necessary actions to provide proper assistance to prevent congenital defects in these populations.</dc:description>
