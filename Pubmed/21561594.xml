<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Succinic dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) is an enzyme belonging to the mitochondrial complex II. The aim of this study is to analyse SDHB expression in a series of Warthin's tumours, studying its relationship with oncocytic changes, constantly present in this form of tumour. MATERIAL AND METHODS In resection tumour specimens from a series of ten Warthin's tumours (all from the parotid gland), immunohistochemical expression of SDHB was analysed using a commercially-available monoclonal antibody. RESULTS The Warthin's tumours studied affected 10 men (mean age: 64.2 yrs, range 40-80), all with smoking habits, and 2 with metachronous bilateral involvement. Two patients presented associated urothelial carcinoma. Our SDHB study showed marked reactivity (++/+++) in all cases in the oncocytic epithelial component and also in striated duct cytoplasm (+) from non-tumorous parotid tissue. Expression was not influenced by age, smoking intensity or bilateral character. One of the tumours showed squamous metaplasia foci with SDHB-negativity at this level. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Due to the constant and intense SDHB reactivity in oncocytic cells in our observations, oncocytic changes are not considered to be associated with defective enzyme activity in the mitochondrial complex II. Strong SDHB reactivity is an additional marker of oncocytic changes in Warthin's tumour. Neither of these facts has been described previously.</dc:description>
