<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To describe the overall and disease-free survival at five and ten years after breast cancer diagnosis in women from a previous case-control study, and establish related prognostic factors. METHODS We followed up 202 patients diagnosed between 1996 and 1998 in three public hospitals in Granada and Almeria provinces in Spain. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan and Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazards model was applied to identify the most significant variables contributing to survival. RESULTS Mean age at diagnosis was 54.27 ± 10.4 years. Mean follow-up for overall survival was 119.91 months (95%CI 113.65-126.17); the five-year survival rate was 83.9% (95%CI: 78.13-89.66) and the ten-year rate was 71% (95% CI: 63.25-78.74). Mean follow-up for disease-free survival was 118.75 months (95%CI 111.86-125.65); the five-year disease-free survival rate was 81% (95% CI: 74.52-87.47) and the ten-year rate was 71.3% (95% CI: 63.33-79.26). The mortality rate of the study population was 33.17%. CONCLUSIONS Disease characteristics are similar in our population to those in other Spanish and European regions, while the overall survival is higher than the mean rate during the same period in Europe (5-yr rate of 79%) and similar to that in Spain (83%).</dc:description>
