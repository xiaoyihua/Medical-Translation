<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To validate an instrument to evaluate the clinic aptitude of the pregraduate intern in the integral attention of the diabetic patient with chronic complications at home. METHODS A comparative cross-sectional study; 114 pregraduate interns from five medical units were included to determine the clinic aptitude by an instrument with five real clinical cases of diabetic patients. Seven clinical indicators and 175 statements were used. The instrument was validated with two rounds of experts and the trustworthiness with a pilot group. Nonparametric statistics were used. RESULTS The consistency of the instrument was of 0.91. The clinic aptitude of the pregraduate interns was low and very low, except in a medical units that resulted intermediate. When comparing the five medical units, there were significant differences in the global qualification in six of the seven indicators. CONCLUSIONS The instrument fulfilled the requirements of validity.</dc:description>
