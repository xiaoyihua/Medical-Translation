<dc:description xml:lang="en">Diarrhea is a frequent and potentially severe complication of kidney transplantation. We describe here, in a cross-sectional study, the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of acute and persistent diarrhea in 52 inpatients with kidney and kidney-pancreas transplant in a hospital in Buenos Aires, 42 (80.8%) of whom had received a kidney and 10 (19.2%) a kidney-pancreas transplant. Diarrhea was the reason of admission of 34 cases (65.4%). The etiology could be studied in 50 patients: 25 (50%) had no etiological diagnosis of diarrhea and 18 (36%) had a specific infectious etiology: 3 (6%) cytomegalovirus disease, 6 (12%) diarrhea attributed to cytomegalovirus, 5 (10%) to rotavirus and 4 (8%) to Clostridium difficile. In 7 (14%) diarrhea was attributed to drugs (mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus). Patients with infectious diarrhea had recently received high doses of immunosuppressive therapy more frequently than the rest (p = 0.048). Those with diarrhea attributed to drugs were more frequently on mycophenolate mofetil than the rest (p = 0.039). Empirical modification of the immunosuppressive treatment was done in 16 (30.8%) and empirical antibiotic therapy was given to 47 patients (90.4%). Median length of hospital stay was 6 days. Seven patients (14.6%) persisted with diarrhea at the fifth day of admission. At hospital discharge all cases had complete resolution of symptoms and one third persisted with kidney failure. Information provided in this study can be useful as a starting point for improving preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic measures in these patients.</dc:description>
