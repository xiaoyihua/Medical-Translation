<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The last decade has seen tremendous growth of surgical robotics. Popularized for radical prostatectomy, robotic techniques are now increasingly being applied to radical cystectomy. Herein, we review the development and current status of robotic radical cystectomy (RRC) in contemporary urological practice. METHODS Between 1995 and 2007 published literature was reviewed using the National Library of Medicine database and the following key words: robotic, robot-assisted, laparoscopic and cystectomy Since the first report in 2003, nine published original reports were identified. These were evaluated with regards to the technique, advantages and disadvantages, perioperative and oncological outcomes. Our initial experience, as yet unpublished, is also described. RESULTS At this writing, all published papers on RRC are based on small number of patients with short-term follow-up. Nevertheless, they have demonstrated the technical feasibility of RRC with encouraging perioperative outcomes. Compared to open radical cystectomy (ORC), RRC appears to be associated with decreased blood loss, hospital stay and analgesic requirement. These advantages are also found with laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) and are a function of the minimally invasive approach. The operating time is longer, markedly so when the bowel work is performed intracorporeally. CONCLUSIONS RRC is in evolution. Technical feasibility has been demonstrated. Initial perioperative outcomes are encouraging. Oncological outcomes are awaited to identify the role of RRC in the management of bladder cancer. Multi-center prospective randomized trials comparing ORC with RRC and LRC are necessary.</dc:description>
