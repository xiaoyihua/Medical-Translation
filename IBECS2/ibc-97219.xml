<dc:title xml:lang="en">Chemical reconstruction of skin scars with 90% trichloroacetic acid or 88% phenol: a comparative study</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Introduction: Acne is a comon disease that affects the pilosebaceous unit and produces many cosmetic sequels, like scarring. Patients and methods: This study has been performed to evaluate the benefit of treating depressed acne scars with CROSS ( chemical reconstruction of skin scars ) technique versus 90% trichloroacetic acid (90% TCA) and 88% phenol. Acne scars in eight patients were treated by applying the chemical substances directly to the scars. We used wooden applicators to apply 88% phenol to the scars of the right hemiface and 90% TCA to the scars of the left hemiface. The procedure was repeated at monthly intervals for a total of five treatments. Results: The burning sensation that occurs at the time of application of both substances was more intense when using TCA. The erythema area that surges at the site of application is more evident and lasts longer with TCA. The reepithelization of the skin treated was slower with TCA. The majority of patients showed best cosmetic results at the hemiface where 88% phenol has been used. Discussion: In this study, the CROSS technique had good results but it required long time to produce clinical visible results. When both substances were compared, 88% phenol seemed to be more satisfactory than 90% TCA since it produced less pain, showed best cosmetic results and had faster reepithelization.
