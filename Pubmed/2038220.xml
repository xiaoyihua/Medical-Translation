<dc:description xml:lang="en">The first patient with myelopathy associated with T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus infection (HTLV-I) in Spain is reported. Although this condition is endemic in several areas from the Caribbean Sea, South America, Africa and Japan, some cases have been reported in European countries, generally in immigrant patients, residents in endemic zones or patients having received transfusions. In the present case the infection was probably acquired in a tropical zone through blood transfusion. The patient was a 60-year-old female who had been living in Peru during the last 25 years. In that country aortocoronary bypass was carried out for ischemic heart disease. During operation she received blood transfusion. One and a half year later she developed progressive spastic parapesia with impaired sphincter control. Other causes were ruled out, and the diagnosis was confirmed by HTLV-I antibody determination with ELISA and Western blot.</dc:description>
