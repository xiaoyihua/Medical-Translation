<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The structural and functional changes observed in the left ventricle in professional soccer players could cause alterations in ventricular rotation (Rv) and ventricular torsion (Tv). Our aim was to characterize the changes in Tv that occur in professional soccer players. METHODS In total, 17 professional soccer players and 10 healthy volunteers who had not undergone training (control subjects) were investigated by M-mode, B-mode and Doppler echocardiography. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic functional and structural parameters were measured. Basal and apical Rv, and Tv were determined using specially developed software (EchoPAC, GE Medical Systems). In addition, Tv was characterized in the time domain. RESULTS In all subjects, left ventricular structural and functional parameters were within the normal ranges. Both left ventricular ejection fraction and shortening were greater in soccer players (P&lt; .05). The magnitude of apical and basal Rv and the magnitude and velocity of Tv were all lower in soccer players (P&lt; .05). In soccer players, there were negative correlations between the maximum Tv achieved and left ventricular shortening and ejection fraction (P&lt; .05). CONCLUSIONS The magnitude and velocity of Tv were lower in soccer players. A reduction in Tv might take place under certain physiological conditions and could represent an adaptive response that contributes to increased ventricular efficiency.</dc:description>
