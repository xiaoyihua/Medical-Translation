<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To review the biography and scientific contributions of Dr. Angel Pulido Martin, fourth chairman of the Department of Urology at the Hospital Provincial of Madrid, and formerly at the Urology Clinic at the San Juan de Dios Hospital of Madrid. In addition, to show a panoramic view on how doctors who obtained scholarships to study outside Spain were trained in a specialty at the beginning of the 20th century. METHODS We reviewed memoirs books from Dr. Pulido Martin ("Medical letters", "Dr. Pulido and his time", and "Memoirs of a doctor"), his Ph.D. thesis and other works. We also reviewed biographic data obtained from his contemporaries in different publications. RESULTS We report his experiences as a student in the specialities of Urology and Gynecology, since he first thought about taking this last one. Main european urologic and gynecologic centers of that time are represented, as well as some of the main characters in these specialties. We appreciate his great working spirit, which was inculcated into him by his father Dr. Pulido Fernandez, his enterprising desire, and the great professional he was, creating departments of urology which were school and model for many urologists of his time. CONCLUSIONS A sincere clinician, Dr. Pulido Martin liked accuracy and daily self-improvement. He also was exceptional for his kindness treating patients and disciples. His publications on urologic topics were numerous; he also was fluent and entertaining as a non medical writer. He was an outstanding urologist in the early 20th century; he was member of the committee which elaborated the statutes of the Spanish Society of Urology, in which he was President for 11 years. He was also one of the founding members of the International Society of Urology and delegate of its Spanish chapter. He was official lecturer in several meetings, and also member of the Spanish Academy of Medicine and Surgery.</dc:description>
