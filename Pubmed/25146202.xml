<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Nosocomial infections (NIs) represent an important public health issue, being associated with high morbidity, mortality and costs. OBJECTIVES To identify risk factors of NIs in a cohort of hospitalized pediatric patients, with emphasis in children with special health care needs (CSHCN). PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied patients hospitalized in Sótero del Río Pediatric Hospital at Santiago-Chile, between September and December, 2009. Relative Risk (RR) was calculated between CSHCN-3 (children attended by three or more health care professionals) versus non CSHCN-3, and between children with medical complexity (CMC) versus non CMC, using log-binomial models. RESULTS 920 patients were included. Prevalence of NIs was 12.7%. The most frequent diagnoses were gastrointestinal and respiratory viral infections. Both crude and adjusted by confounders (age and sex), CSHCN-3 and CMC presented significantly higher risk of NIs compared to patients without these conditions (RR 2.91 and RR 2.16, respectively). CONCLUSION CSHCN-3 and CMC represent independent conditions associated to a 2-3 fold risk of NIs.</dc:description>
