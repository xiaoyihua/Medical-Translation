<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the neonatal morbidity and mortality in triplets. METHOD Retrospective study of 189 triplets born between January'98 and December'04. RESULTS Mean maternal age was 33 years. Of the pregnancies, 71.4 % were achieved using fertilization techniques, 84 % received antenatal steroids and 96.8 % of births were by caesarean section. The mean gestational age was 32 weeks (246-355), with a mean birth weight of 1,500 g (450-2,650). There 53.4 % were female neonates. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) at birth was not required by 82 %, 13.5 % required bag-mask ventilation and 4.9 % required advanced CPR. Low/moderate respiratory distress syndrome was observed in 27 % of the infants (oxygen/CPAP), and 19 % required mechanical ventilation and surfactant. 12 % showed patent ductus arteriosus was seen in 12 %, necrotizing enterocolitis in 4.2 %, sepsis (vertical and nosocomial), 17 %, grade III retinopathy in 1.1 % and 7.4 % had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Grade III/IV intraventricular haemorrhage was present in 4.2 %, and 3.2 % periventricular leukomalacia. Survival rate at discharge from hospital was 95.2 %. Of those, 10 % showed risk of serious sequelae defined as: grade III-IV intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, grade III retinopathy and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. There were no major complications in 64.5 % of the children. Despite a prematurity rate of 100 %, this large series of triplets shows an excellent survival and a relatively low serious associated morbidity. It is also important to point out the intensive perinatological follow-up to which these pregnancies are subject.</dc:description>
