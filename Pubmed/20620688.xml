<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the last decade, various studies have suggested that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could favor the development of ischemic heart disease. Several observational and case-control studies have confirmed that patients with COPD have a higher risk of cardiovascular disorders. However, this increased risk could be largely explained by a greater prevalence of classical risk factors. Currently, there are no data to indicate a causal relation between COPD and cardiovascular disease and the concept of systemic inflammation as a common pathogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Equally, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that some drugs, such as statins or inhaled corticoids, could decrease cardiovascular risk in patients with COPD by reducing systemic inflammation. Currently, these drugs should only be recommended if patients show specific indications for their use.</dc:description>
