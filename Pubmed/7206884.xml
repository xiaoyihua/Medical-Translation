<dc:description xml:lang="en">The hemodynamic findings of a group of 112 patients with a prior history of myocardial infarction have been reviewed. The patients have been classified in three subgroups: anterior (48 cases), posterior (43 cases), and biventricular electrical infarction (21 cases). There was only one female in the 112 cases. There was a good correlation between the electrical region of infarction and ventricular asynergy localized to the same territory (76.65, and 90 %, respectively), as well as significant involvement of the corresponding coronary artery (89.88 and 100 %, respectively). A high percentage of patients with significant lesions of the coronary artery opposite the infarction was found (48 % in anterior necrosis, and 76 % in posterior lesions). In five cases the coronary vessels had no abnormalities. Ejection fraction and postangiography end diastolic pressure were the parameters of ventricular function most constantly altered. From this study it appears particularly relevant that there is a low incidence of women: there exists a good correlation between the infarct, the zone of asynergy, and the affected coronary; the number of affected coronaries increases with age; there are significant lesions in the opposite coronary, and there is a greater alteration of ventricular function in patients with biventricular infarction, followed by patients with anterior infarction.</dc:description>
