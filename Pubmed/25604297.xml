<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To explore the information and counseling needs of a group of Mexican women during use of the HPV test. MATERIALS AND METHODS In 2011, 24 semistructured interviews were done with women upon receiving HPV test results in two municipalities in the state of Michoacan. Qualitative analysis of the interviews was done using constant comparison techniques. RESULTS During their use of screening services women received limited counseling; they felt anguish and confusion. Women were interested in receiving information and advice on HPV and cervical cancer, the meaning of test result, next steps to be taken in their healthcare use as well as information and emotional support related to the sexual transmission of HPV. CONCLUSIONS The design and implementation of policies are needed which instigate health education and counseling in conjunction with HPV testing.</dc:description>
