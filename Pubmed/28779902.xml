<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this article is to review possible indications and controversies about the most frequent uses of ESAs in the treatment of anaemia in elderly patients with oncological and non-oncological diseases. Using PubMed a systematic review was carried out on articles published from 1985 to September 2016, as well as a review of the main Spanish, European, and American consensus guidelines on each of the following diseases in which could pose the treatment of anaemia associated with ESA. A review was also carried out on the main Spanish, European and American consensus guidelines regarding the management of anaemia related to the diseases outlined in this article. It was found that there are limitations of its use in elderly patients with advanced disease, mainly due to the lack of uniformity and consensus in the recommendations, and the absence of large-scale prospective trials to determine the effectiveness of ESA in this population. There seems to be consensus in the use in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, individualised in patients with non-myeloid cancer on treatment without curative intent, and in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, still responders to space transfusional support. In the remainder, it should be individualised, since the risk of mortality and cardioembolic morbidity is clearly increased. It should not be the solution to treat anaemia, in cases of urgency or short-term transfusional need, which are often present in these patients.</dc:description>
