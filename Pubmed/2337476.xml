<dc:description xml:lang="en">Different types of delayed pectoralis major myocutaneous flap were studied in the rabbit. Four types of delayed bipedicle flaps were carried out in fifty animals, comparing the survival of delayed and undelayed flaps. The results showed an improvement of survival in the previously delayed flaps, being more profitable for the survival of the flaps the delay procedure in which more than one vascular pedicle was ligated. The beneficial effect of the delay method in the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap in the rabbit can be explained because the vascular anatomy of the flap in this animal, being the myocutaneous component secondary, as it has very few perforating musculocutaneous branches. On the contrary that occurs in men, the skin of rabbits is mainly supplied by axial arteries.</dc:description>
