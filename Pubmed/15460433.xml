<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Vulvovaginal candidosis is one of the most frequent infections of the female genital system. It is believed that 75% of women in reproductive life have suffered from vulvovaginal candidosis at least once in their life. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a clinimetric scale based on clinical characteristics and factors of risk to diagnose vulvovaginal candidosis and to establish the cut points. MATERIAL AND METHODS A questionnaire was elaborated by means of consensus, there were questions about symptoms and risk factors for the diagnosis. It was applied to women in reproductive age, besides the cervicovaginal culture. The resulting questionnaire was evaluated by means of the analysis of sensitivity according to the criteria of Feinstein. The determination of points of cut was made by means of curves ROC as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value. The univariable analysis was made by means of the test of chi2 and the exact test of Fisher. We used likelihood ratio for association of variables and the multi-variate logistic regression analysis was made to fit variable potentials. RESULTS One-hundred forty-two women answered the questionnaire, 39 (27%) had positive isolation to Candida. Vulvar edema (3.49 OR IC 95% 1.16-10.43 p = 0.02) and ardor (OR 2.40 IC 95% 0.88-6.51 p = 0.08) were significant. None of the risk factors were statistically significant. It was reported with sensitivity of 76%, specificity of 38%, VPP 32% and VPN 81% for the = 60 record. CONCLUSION The clinimetric scale is brief, valid and easy to apply. It can be used independently of the educative or cultural factors that limit the accomplishment of other forms of diagnosis, such as the vaginal flow exam and the cervicovaginal culture.</dc:description>
