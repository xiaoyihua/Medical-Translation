<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of personal appointments for increasing flu vaccine coverage in over-65s who showed no intention of being vaccinated of their own accord. DESIGN Controlled, intervention study, single-blind and with randomised distribution. SETTING Primary health centre. PARTICIPANTS Population over 65 in the municipality of San Cristovo de Cea (Ourense) who had not been vaccinated after three-quarters of the flu vaccine campaign had elapsed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS After three-quarters of the flu vaccine campaign, a randomised sample (n = 162) was taken from the over-65 population not vaccinated (N = 640). These 162 were sent a personal letter reminding them of the vaccination campaign, the personal risk they ran and advising them to be vaccinated. They were given an appointment time. During the remaining 14 days of the campaign, all the vaccinations continued to be monitored. Afterwards, the control group and those who had received the intervention were compared. 28 people were vaccinated, 19 from the intervention group (11.7%) and 9 from the control group (1.9%) (RR = 6.2; 95% CI, 2.9-13.5; FA = 84%). There were no significant differences between sexes. CONCLUSIONS Personal appointments were effective in increasing vaccine coverage, even among people at first reluctant to be vaccinated, the group at which the intervention should be aimed.</dc:description>
