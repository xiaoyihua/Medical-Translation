<dc:description xml:lang="en">Tracheal suctioning is essential to maintain permeability of the artificial airway. This procedure may be associated to risks for the patients. Thus, it is very important to know if the nurses perform it correctly and if the practice is based on scientific evidence. This investigations objectives are: evaluate practical competence of the nurses, as well as the scientific knowledge that they have on this procedures in a Polyvalent Intensive Care Unit and analyze if there are discrepancies between the practice competence and scientific knowledge. This descriptive study, performed in 34 nurses, analyzed the performance of tracheal suctioning by direct observation, using the data collection of a structured grid that included 19 aspects to evaluate, grouped into 6 categories. In the same way, knowledge on the procedure was analyzed, using a 19-item self-administered questionnaire, also grouped into 6 categories, which evaluated the same aspects observed. The total mean score obtained in the practice observation grid (P) was 12.09 for a maximum score of 19, while it was 14.24 in the knowledge questionnaire (Q). When analyzed by categories, discrepancies were obtained in the following aspects: in the need for hand washing prior to suctioning (P = 55.9%; Q = 97.1%), in cleaning of the suction catheter after each suctioning during the procedure (P = 0%; Q = 38.2%), in the correct performance of hyperoxygenation and hyperinsuflation, before, during and after the procedure (P = 11.8%; Q = 941%), in the correct selection of the size suction catheter in relationship with endotracheal tubes internal lumen (P = 0%; Q = 52.9%), in the maximum time the catheter remains in the trachea (P = 100%; Q = 23.5%), in the maximum number of times that the catheter should be introduced in each suctioning (P = 100%; Q = 73.5%) and in the non-instillation of saline solution (P = 29.4%; Q = 58.8%). When the total scores obtained were compared, both in practice and knowledge, with the years of experience in ICU, no statistically significant differences were found. It is concluded that the study nurses have scientific knowledge of the suctioning procedure that are better than their practice competence. Discrepancies between practice and knowledge were also found in several of the aspects evaluated, which orients towards the specific needs of training in this procedure.</dc:description>
