<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper is part of the "Southern cone countries multicentric study of primary healthcare: healthcare models, health system integration and intersectoral relations in urban contexts in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay". Its scope is to contextualize, describe and analyze the current state of the PHC strategy in Argentina and its potential for transforming the fragmented and segmented health system. The data-gathering methodology was review of the literature, study of documents, interviews with key informants and workshop discussions with stakeholders of the system. The dimensions of the data analysis were: (1) stewardship capability; (2) PHC financing; (3) provision, human resources and comprehensiveness; (4) integration and continuity. The transversal analytical categories in all the dimensions were the segmentation and fragmentation of governance and the health system. For this reason, the dynamics and actions of the social actors involved in the healthcare system and their position in relation to PHC were analyzed. The paper contains a theoretical introduction on the scope of current definitions of PHC and the description of the social, economic, political and epidemiological context of healthcare policies in Argentina. PHC based on the proposed dimensions is then analyzed.</dc:description>
