<dc:description xml:lang="en">From 1982 to 1994, 1.003 cases of surgical newborns have been retrospectively studied. Frequency and epidemiology have been evaluated, so as associated malformations. Prenatal diagnosis was made in 72 cases (7.1%). The most frequent entity was intestinal atresia, with 122 cases (12.1%), followed by necrotizing enterocolitis in 80 cases (7.9%), nevertheless this last one was the most frequent finding in preterm newborns. Esophageal atresia was found in 57 cases (5.6%). Association with other malformations was found in 127 cases (12.6%), and 32 cases of them (3.1%) constituted congenital malformations syndromes. The number of surgical newborns has increased in the last years, mainly due to ambulatory surgery. Global mortality of operated patients was 62 cases (5.9%); the highest mortality index was for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (33.5%), followed by necrotizing enterocolitis (28%). Mortality rate has decreased in recent years, due to improving in management and treatment of these patients, and the consolidation of surgical newborn units. Future efforts should be aimed for decreasing in mortality and improving the standard of life of these patients.</dc:description>
