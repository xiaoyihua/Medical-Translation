<dc:description xml:lang="en">Authors report six cases on Burkitt's lymphoma seen during the last 18 months. In all of them a large ileocecal tumor was present and five of them had a bone marrow involvement. The ascitic fluid was positive in all cases. Three of the patients had a marked jaundice at diagnosis. The immunologic markers study on two of the cases, made evident that they belonged to type B. One of these two cases showed a component M in serum of the IgM type. As soon as chemotherapy started two of the cases showed marked metabolic disturbances. Three of the cases died and the three others remain free of disease for as long as two, 26 and 21 months. This report arises a comment epidemiologic importance of the increased frequency of Burkitt's lymphoma during the last months, as well as the clinic features of the six reported cases as compared to series published in non endemic areas on this topic.</dc:description>
