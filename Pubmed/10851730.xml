<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report on a female patient with metachronous bilateral Wilms' tumor with a long survival. METHODS An 11-year-old girl underwent total nephrectomy when she was 4 years old for Wilms' tumor of the right kidney. She received cobalt therapy and chemotherapy, and the evolution was good for three years, at which time a control US scan detected a tumor in the left kidney that was diagnosed as Wilms' tumor. She underwent a partial nephrectomy at the Hospital Pediátrico de Centro Habana (Cuba) and received chemotherapy. RESULTS/CONCLUSION A recent US scan and a descending pyelogram showed completely normal findings and growth of the remaining renal parenchyma. The patient is alive and well 7 years and 8 months later.</dc:description>
