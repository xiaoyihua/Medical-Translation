<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Genetic studies indicate that nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate (NSCLP) has the characteristics of a complex genetic trait. Reports from different authors have suggested several candidate genes mapping in different chromosome regions. Association studies have suggested that a clefting locus is located on chromosome 6p. On these grounds we have investigated the possible association between five microsatellite markers located on 6p22-25 and NSCLP. AIM To test the hypothesis on the possible association of a clefting locus with microsatellite markers located in 6p22-25. PATIENTS AND METHODS The sample consisted of 54 unrelated case-parent trios that comprise 54 NSCLP probands and 108 parents. Five microsatellite markers spanning the region 6p22-25 were analyzed for each individual by means of polymerase chain reaction with fluorescent labeled microsatellite markers. Electrophoresis of the PCR products was performed on a laser-fluorescent DNA sequencer. Nonparametric ETDT and MCETDT programs, were used to analyze the genotype data. RESULTS The family based association study showed that for the genotype wise analysis, only D6S259 presented a significant p-value (0.03). Nevertheless no individual allele of this marker showed an evident preferential transmission from heterozygous parents to affected offspring. CONCLUSIONS The results of the present study do not show a clear evidence that a candidate gene for NSCLP may be located within or near the analyzed chromosome region in our sample. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that the genotype wise analysis shows a significant p-value for D6S259 marker.</dc:description>
