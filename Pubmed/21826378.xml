<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Studying the work-family relationships is important because it affects the personal and professional life. Women increases in medicine without redistribute domestic tasks and responsibilities. The purpose of this study was to create and validate a scale of work-family relations in women and men family physician (FP) in Andalusia. METHODS Cross sectional and multicenter study. The study population were FP of urban primary care centres, sample=500FP (50% by sex). We studied: sex, age, postgraduate family medicine specialty, care burden (2 variables), and family burden (7 variables). We design, and included in self-administered questionnaires, a scale of 13 questions on work-family relations. Bivariate analysis, exploratory factor and multiple regressions to test the convergent validity was performed. RESULTS The response rate was 73.6%. We identified two dimensions, Overloading and Family Support Deficit (OFSD) (5 questions), and Work-Family Conflict (WFC) (6 questions), in both, female FP score higher than their peers. There are more family variables associated with both dimensions in female FP, it expresses differences in the complexity of the causes of OFSD and WFC by sex. CONCLUSION The scale obtained is valid, reliable and gives two empirical dimensions of family-work relationships.</dc:description>
