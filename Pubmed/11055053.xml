<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the factors which affect the burden and quality of life in carers of patients with Alzheimer's disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS From a sample of 234 carers of patients in the Unit for Assessment of Memory and Dementia with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, according to the scale of National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCS-ADRDA), and of minimal or slight severity, according to the Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination (CAMDEX) criteria, we obtained sociodemographic variables and administered the following questionnaires: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Rapid Disability Rating Scale (RDRS-2), Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) and Burden Interview (BI). RESULTS The sex of the carers, the hours of attention to the basic activities of daily life (BADL) and the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOQ), Minimental State Examination (MMSE), QLQ, NPI and RDRS-2 scores were related to the BI score. Multiple regression accepted the scoring for NPI, RDRS-2 and QLQ in the model. The QLQ score was associated with male sex of the patient, the age of the carer, employment status, whether or not he lived with the patient, with the family relationship, the hours of attention to the BADL and the scores on CAMCOG, MMSE, RDRS-2, NPI and BI. The multiple regression model included the age of the carer, the BI score and the hours of attention to the BADL. CONCLUSION The non-cognitive symptoms, functional disability and poor perception of quality of life are factors affecting the burden and age of the carer, the hours of attention to the BADL and the burden affecting quality of life.</dc:description>
