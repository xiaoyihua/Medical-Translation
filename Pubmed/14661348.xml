<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES A national immunization day-NID, aimed at improving vaccination coverage, was carried out in Colombia in November 2001. The main objective of the study was to measure the proportion of children under 2 years either completing their immunization schedule or advancing through it by receiving doses during the NID. Besides, we also evaluated the proportion of lost opportunities for vaccination during the NID and the impact of the media (TV, ratio, newspapers, etc.) in advertising the NID. METHODS In order to evaluate the impact of immunization a cross sectional survey was carried out in Bogot치 in the waiting rows of the 30 randomly selected vaccination posts; 623 participants were systematically chosen. The outcomes were analyzed by age, socioeconomic level and type of health insurance-SSS. Only children holding a vaccination card were considered eligible for the study. RESULTS Most people become aware about NID through TV, 81%, followed by radio advertisements, 22%. After attending NID the proportion of fully vaccinated children, according to PAHO scheme, raised from 46% to 66%, a 43% increase. This increase was even higher among children aged less than 6 months (140% increment). There were no differences in the increment by social stratum or affiliation to the SSS. Among the children studied we identified a 24% of loss opportunities for vaccination that did not differ by socioeconomic level or SSS groups. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that, despite its high costs, NID might be useful to transiently overcome barriers for adequate access to health services.</dc:description>
