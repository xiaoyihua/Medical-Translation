<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The objective of this study is to determine the utility and reliability of endoluminal sonography transducer in the diagnosis and follow up after the treatment of partial ureteral obstruction. MATERIAL AND METHODS Ten healthy Large White female pigs, weighing 35-40 Kg, were induced a partial ureteral obstruction by laparoscopic approach. All the studied animals underwent the same three-phase procedure; inducement (phase 1), diagnosis (phase 2) and treatment of experimental strictures (phase 3), as well as, a month follow up. In all the stages of the study endoluminal sonography was used to diagnose the stricture and to assess the treatment, as well as, to measure the internal ureter diameter. RESULTS The endoluminal ultrasonography was able to assess, in all the cases, the affectation of all the ureteral layers. All the animals develop a ureteral stricture after a four weeks ligature and, except in one animal, they progress favourably after the treatment using the balloon rupture technique of the stricture ureter. The means of the ureteral diameter are: phase 1 (0.46 +/- 0.10 cm), phase 2 (0.30 +/- 0.17 cm), phase 3 (0.47 +/- 0.13 cm). CONCLUSIONS The use of the IVUS in the diagnosis of ureteral strictures results safe and useful, as well as, its application in the election and in the assessment of the treatment.</dc:description>
