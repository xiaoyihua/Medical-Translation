<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE [corrected] The Spanish postgraduate medical education system has made great contributions to the development of the National Health Service. Despite recent regulations on critical aspects of this education system, there still remains a need for a global assessment process. Hospital services evaluation by the residents should play a part in this process. METHODS Administration over three years in a general teaching hospital of a specific questionnaire devoted to measure residents' perceptions of tthe medical education provided by their own service or department. Only residents who had stayed at least one year in their service were allowed to participate. Multivariable analyses using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Automatic Classification (AC) methods were performed. RESULTS The overall response rate was 66.6% (325/488). 84,7% of the respondents deemed the overall education received as either adequate or excellent. The better scored aspects were patient management education, ethics education and residents' patient care supervision (more than 80% responses rating them as adequate/excellent). Performance of interdepartamental and bibliographic sessions along with research education were the worse perceived aspects by residents (less than 50% of responses as adequate/excellent). A factorial plane that explained 95% of overall response variability and allowed to rank the residents according to their assessment of education was obtained. Services with utmost ratings were found. AC results showed that were three different groups on the basis of overall peception of education received: The first group (18.2%) deemed it as excellent, the second group (61.5%) as adequate, while the thrid group (20.3%) considered it as inadequate. CONCLUSIONS The administration of this questionnaire to hospital's residents and the analysis of its results using specific multivariable techniques provides useful information in order to monitor postgraduate medical education programmes and detect areas of improvement.</dc:description>
