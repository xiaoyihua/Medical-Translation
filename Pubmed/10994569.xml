<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Due to the lack of existing data regarding urinary symptoms and quality of life secondary to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) in the active Spanish population, and with the objective to evaluate the QoL in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of BPH, we decided to conduct a national study which included 2,312 men employed by the National Railway Association (RENFE). SUBJECTS AND METHODS 14 cities were selected and clinical histories, physical examinations, IPSS-L questionnaires and prostate echographies were conducted following the diagnostic guidelines of the Third International Committee by the WHO. RESULTS Almost 20% of the men participating in the study had moderate or severe symptoms according to the IPSS and almost 15% were unsatisfied with their urinary situation. 3 out of every 4 men between the age of 50-65 years with moderate-severe symptoms have their urinary quality of life affected. The most prevalent symptoms were: filling, nicturia in almost 60% of the subjects, and emptying, the force and flow of the urinary stream diminishing in one out of every 3 participants. CONCLUSIONS With an increase in age there is a higher prevalence of symptoms as dimmed by the IPSS, a poorer urinary quality of life, and a larger prostate volume as measured by echography.</dc:description>
