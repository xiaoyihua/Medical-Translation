<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, in which participate many cells and cellular elements. OBJECTIVE To assess the utility of the zafirlukast, an antagonist of the receivers of the leukotrienes, in asthmatic children of our environment and to evaluate the grade of safety of the medication in the preventive treatment of the asthma. MATERIAL AND METHODS We selected 50 moderate-severe asthmatic children, between 12 and 16 years (of both sexes) with non satisfactory evolution, in spite of the conventional preventive treatment for the asthma. Zafirlukast were given in dose of 20 mg every 12 hours, far from the foods, during 12 weeks. We carried out laboratory studies, before and after the treatment, evaluating the hematic (Hb and Hto), renal (creatinine) and hepatic (TGP) functions. They were continued in allergy consultation at the 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment, to know their clinical evolution, the apparition of adverse reactions and the use of other asthmatic medications in the period of the treatment. RESULTS The 88% of the children improved clinically. The patients decreased the use of oral steroids and only 4 adverse reactions (8%) were reported, with total regression of the symptoms when suppressing the medication. The averages of the laboratory results, before and after the treatment, reflected values into the established normal limits, Hb: 12.4 (before) and 12.1 g/L (later), creatinine: 63.2 and 67.1 mMol/1 and TGP: 2.1 and 3.6 units. CONCLUSIONS We observed in our study that the preventive treatment with Zafirlukast is useful and well tolerated, representing a new expectation for the asthma, in pediatric ages.</dc:description>
