<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The principal feature of Hirschsprung disease is the absence of relaxation in the aganglionic segment. Currently, surgery can be performed during the neonatal period. MATERIAL AND METHODS We included patients from January 2000 to June 2004 who underwent endorectal transanal pull-through. Diagnosis was confirmed before surgery by histopathological analysis. RESULTS We included patients 10 patients, ages 1-17 years. Half were female, and one patient also had Down syndrome. Another two had had previous surgeries. Seven patients presented with a classical segment, two with short segments, and one with a long segment. Evacuations began at an average of 4 days after the procedure. One patient had dehiscence of the anastomosis, two patients had anal spasm and anal lesions, and one patient presented intestinal obstruction secondary to anal stenosis. Evacuations normalized 2 weeks post-surgery. CONCLUSION Abdominal vascular dissections and transanal resection of the affected segment with coloanal anastomosis is a good surgical option compared to other surgical techniques.</dc:description>
