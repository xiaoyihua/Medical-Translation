<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the process performed in Catalonia (Spain) to design an information system for monitoring new cases of HIV infection. METHODS A survey was used to evaluate perception of the need for notification of HIV infection by health care professionals (n = 106), as well as their opinions of the various possibilities for the implementation of the notification system. As a result of this evaluation, a specific technical report defining the objectives and technical characteristics of the new notification system was produced. The feasibility of the system in health centres was evaluated through discussions with health care professionals, health authorities and Non-Governmental Organizations, and a second survey was designed to evaluate the use of a personal identification code (PIC) from the individual health card (IHC). This process took plabe between 1998 and 2000. RESULTS A total of 84.5% of the health care professionals believed that HIV notification should be mandatory and confidential; 90.4%, were of the opinion that notification would enable identification of the epidemiological characteristics of infected individualos, and 75% believed that these individuals would have to be identified by name. Finally, 66% of the health care professionals believed that the use of the PIC from the IHC would be feasible as the personal identifier in HIV notification. A final proposal was draw up and 1 January, 2001 was set as the date to initiate the pilot phase of the new HIV notification system. CONCLUSIONS Most of the health care professionals surveyed expressed the need for notification of HIV infection, and for such notification to receive institutional endorsement. They also believed that, as with other diseases of individualized mandatory reporting, notification should be carried out with a single personal identifier. The information obtained from notification of HIV infection is essential for the optimal planning of preventive programs and the provision of health services. The main difficulties observed were that HIV infection has not been included among the diseases of mandatory reporting, as well as the low implantation of the PIC in the hospitals' clinical registries. All the sectors involved have an important role to play in creating the conditions necessary for the notification system of new cases of HIV infection to be feasible and useful.</dc:description>
