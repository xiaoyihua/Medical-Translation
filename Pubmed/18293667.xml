<dc:description xml:lang="en">Placenta chorioangioma is the most frequent non-trophoblastic tumor of the placenta. Its real incidence is unknown. This incidence is reported as 1% in microscopically examined placentas and counts with clinical evidence in approximately 1: 3,500 to 9,000 births. This tumor is not generally associated to maternal fetal complications, unless the tumor size surpasses a diameter of 5 cm or is near the place of umbilical cord insertion. When the tumor is big, it can complicate the pregnancy with hydramnios, postpartum bleeding, delay in the intrauterine growth, or congestive heart failure in the newborn. The clinic case belongs to a Korean female patient, aged 32, without important antecedents. A placental tumouration, 50.2 x 44.1 mm, was detected by ultrasound to this patient in her 37 1/7 week of pregnancy. She has a normoevolutive pregnancy whose was a term, she had an a eutocic delivery, getting a male whose weight was 2,850 g. The baby is still alive. The placenta histopathological study reported placental chorioangioma, which infracted partially, with multifocal calcification areas.</dc:description>
