<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Systematic review of the efficacy of calcium and vitamin D for the treatment of osteoporosis. MATERIAL AND METHOD Review of the database MEDLINE between 1996 and may 1998, by the key words: osteoporosis, calcium, vitamin D (and related terms) and randomized clinical trial. Review of the electronic versions of Best Evidence, The Cochrane Library, congress abstracts and references from two main textbooks. Ascending review of the literature. All the reviews were performed independently by two of the authors. Design parameters and main results of the primary publications of the identified trials were tabulated. Two independent observers carried out methodological scoring of the studies. Results were tabulated and a judgement made for the results. RESULTS Eleven studies on calcium, 8 of vitamin D and 12 about calcitriol and other hormone derivatives were included. Studies with calcium were mainly performed on non-clinical populations and in three anti-fracture efficacy was analyzed. Results were positive in population with low baseline intake and substantial supplementation. Trials on vitamin D were done in non-clinical and on institutionalized populations. Trials with calcitriol were developed mainly in osteoporotic fracture populations and reached poorer methodological validity scores. Heterogeneity of the studies precluded a meta-analysis of the different treatments. Studies on calcium showed clinical efficacy in a more consistent way. Inter-observer score was good (kappa = 0.81) and there were no significant correlations between sample size and effect in the different studies. CONCLUSIONS Calcium treatment is efficacious in populations with low intake receiving substantial supplementation. Vitamin D is efficacious associated with calcium mainly in deficient populations. Efficacy of calcitriol and other derivatives is more controversial.</dc:description>
