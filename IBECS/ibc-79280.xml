<dc:description xml:lang="es">Objective To improve the clinical management of postmenopausal osteroporosis, an intervention based on the implementation of a guideline agreed to between the Primary Care and Specialized departments of all centers at &#147;Mutua of Terrassa&#148; was carried out. Methods Descriptive and interventional study. The intervention consisted of the elaboration of a consensus guideline that was presented in all centers. Results were assessed from bone densitometry studies requested by family physicians over 1 year. Results 1.165 densitometric studies were requested, of which 689 were for the diagnosis of new patients. For the evaluation of the guidelines, details were obtained from 560. 502 studies (89,6% IC95% 87,1&#150;92,2) complied with indication criteria established in the guideline. Of the total of patients who received bisphosphonates and other drugs affecting bone metabolism (43 osteopenic and 167 osteoporotic), 83,7% (IC95% 69,3&#150;93,2) and 89,8% (IC95% 85,2&#150;94,4) respectively complied with drug recommendations. Drug consumption during the year 2007 was reduced by 152.745 euros (&amp;#8722;6,3%) although the number of patients increased in 565 (+4,9%) with respect to the previous year. 442 (78,9% IC95% 75,6&#150;82,3) densitometries presented a result in the osteopenia or osteroporosis category. There were statistically significant differences of the results according to the patients' age and the motive for the bone densitometry request. Conclusions Implementation of the guideline allowed for the effective management of the clinical process of osteroporosis in our field(AU)</dc:description>
