<dc:description xml:lang="en">Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva is an anatomical abnormality that is usually associated with myocardial ischemia and sudden death. Although this abnormality may coexist with obstructive atherosclerotic coronary disease, disease is not usually found in the anomalous course of the artery. When this coronary anomaly and obstructive coronary disease are both present, it is difficult to determine the cause of ischemic symptoms. We report a case in which three different diagnostic techniques were used to find the cause of ischemic symptoms in a patient whose left coronary artery originated anomalously in the right sinus of Valsalva and followed a course between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk and who had obstructive atherosclerotic lesions in the right coronary artery. The techniques were conventional angiography, which was used for the initial diagnosis, multislice computerized tomography, which was used to determine the anomalous course of the artery and its relationship with vascular structures, and exercise echocardiography, which was used to evaluate ischemia in the left coronary artery territory after treatment of the stenoses in the right coronary artery.</dc:description>
