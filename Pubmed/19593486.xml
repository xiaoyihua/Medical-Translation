<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES to determine the rate of malnutrition in patients with Crohn's disease in our area (Substudy A). We assess in long-term the response of malnourished patients to treatment of nutritional supplement with TGF-beta2 (Substudy B). SUBJECTS ninety-eight (51% females) patients with Crohn's disease without selection, ages: 39.2 +/- 15.19 years, range: 18-81 years were included in Substudy A. In Substudy B thirty-nine malnourished patients (52% females) were included with an average age of 36.41 +/- 5.2 years and range: 19-45 (Substudy B). METHODS the design of the Substudy A was an observational and cross sectional study. Whereas, the Substudy B was a longitudinal, open intervention study with active (historical) control. The variables were anthropometric parameters, electrical bioimpedance, biochemical measures, index of disease activity, subjective global assessment and the kind of treatment that every patient has received. MAIN RESULTS the malnutrition rate was 52%, being the most frequent the caloric malnutrition, followed by mixed malnutrition. Thirty four per cent of the patients had iron deficiency. Twelve months of nutritional therapy with supplement specifically enriched in TGF-beta2 improved the evolution of the disease determined by a decrease in CDAI. CONCLUSIONS The rate of malnutrition was similar to that of previous studies realized in Spain. Our study confirms the high rate of iron deficiency that the patients suffer with Crohn's disease. The response to the treatment is favorable, especially regarding the natural history of the disease.</dc:description>
