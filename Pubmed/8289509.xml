<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis is the most frequent congenital disease in Caucasian and is transmitted by recessive autosomic inheritance. It is characterized by affection of different glands of exocrine secretion, particularly the pancreas and the lung. The aim of this study was to analyze the degree of alteration of pulmonary and pancreatic exocrine function in a group of patients with cystic fibrosis in relation to the time of disease evolution. METHODS Twenty-one patients between 9 and 31 years of age were studied; 11 with an evolution of lower than or equal to 158 months and 10 with an evolution of higher than 158 months (median of the total patients). To study pancreatic exocrine function the BT-PABA test immunoreactive serum trypsin test were used. To evaluate respiratory function FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio and PaO2 were used. RESULTS The results obtained demonstrated that in the group with a lower time of evolution the diagnosis had been carried out at earlier ages (17 +/- 17 months versus 84 +/- 60 months; p = 0.002) and presented a significantly more altered pancreatic exocrine function (BT-PABA: 13 +/- 12% versus 35 +/- 23%; p = 0.013). However, respiratory function was altered in the group with longer time of evolution (FEV1: 68 +/- 20% versus 36 +/- 23%; p = 0.003; FVC: 74 +/- 9 versus 52 +/- 25%; p = 0.013; FEV1/FEV: 77 +/- 19 versus 50 +/- 9%; p &lt; 0.001; PaO2: 84 +/- 16 versus 58 +/- 11%; p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Pancreatic exocrine function is most intensely affected in patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at earlier and with shorter times of evolution while patients who have the longest time of evolution and who were diagnosed later in life presented greater changes in respiratory function.</dc:description>
