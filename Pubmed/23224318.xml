<dc:description xml:lang="en">Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a rare genetic disorder characterized by fibrotic tissue proliferation and calcification that affect body soft tissues, especially after minor traumas. Joint ankylosis and restrictive respiratory failure can be observed in the most extreme cases of the disease. Because of its rarity, diagnosis is often late and many medical actions, such as biopsy, can result iatrogenic and worsen the prognosis. Diagnosis in the neonatal period may be difficult. There is a little number of cases diagnosed at early ages. The following case concerns a child born from a mother with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva who had signs of the disease at birth. The presence of bilateral deformed and unusually large hallux, generally accompanied by a short and stiff neck, may help in the diagnostic process.</dc:description>
