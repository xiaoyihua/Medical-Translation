<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess the outcome in patients with lung cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospective study in 93 patients with lung cancer in 3 community hospitals. In each evaluation (4-6 weeks) the following results were obtained: a) questionnaire on the quality of life or performance status (QoL/PS), based on different instruments (Karnofsky Performance Scale [KPS], ECOG, QLQ-C30, and the Nottingham Health Profile [NHP], and b) a clinical questionnaire. Active follow-up was for 18 months and survival tracking was to five years. A descriptive analysis of the outcome variables and a survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) were done. The prognostic value of each instrument (Cox) and the correlation between the instruments (Spearman) were also evaluated. RESULTS The mean values recorded at the time of diagnosis between 60% and 70% of the maximum value possible. Mean survival was 12.4 months; accumulated survival was 30% to one year and 4% to 55 months. Only 17% of patients presented any disease-free period. Toxicity of treatment was almost always irrelevant. The correlation between the KPS, the QLQ-30 and the NHP was acceptable and their initial values were important prognostic factors. The QoL/PS scores for the survivors were similar to their initial values, but the global values were 11%. CONCLUSIONS The outcomes measures used in this study provide very useful information, although registration and analysis of the necessary data should be systematic. The KPS was comparable to the other QoL/PS indicators used, but it is shorter, more acceptable and easier to use. Better QoL/PS measurement instruments are needed to evaluate outcomes in the practice of clinical oncology.</dc:description>
