<dc:description xml:lang="en">Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an oral anticonvulsant drug, structurally similar to tricyclic antidepressants. It is preferred over other drugs because it has fewer adverse effects on behavior and alertness. However, hematologic toxicity is possible during therapy with CBZ. Patients should undergo routine monitoring of hematologic function. CBZ can make the skin more sensitive to the sun or ultraviolet light, therefore, dermatological effects of this drug also can happen such as, skin rash, urticaria, and erythema multiforme. The present study reports the case of a female patient that presented hyperchromic-concentric-pruriginous- spots on the skin of her hands after six months of treatment with CBZ. She came to the physicians of the Clinical Pharmacokinetic Service (Laboratory of Toxicology of IAHULA, Mérida-Venezuela) requesting a drug monitoring. The results showed a level of 8.51 microg x. mL(-1), which was found within the therapeutic range (4-12 microg x mL(-1)). Subsequently, the dermatologist diagnosed fixed pigmented erythema related to the ingestion of a specific medication which began disappearing after 15 days of CBZ free-treatment and with the aid of a dermatologic formulation.</dc:description>
