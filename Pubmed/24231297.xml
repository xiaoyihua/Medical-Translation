<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyze the outcomes, predictors of success and predictors of need for hospital admission in our series of patients who underwent ureteroscopy (URS) as a major outpatient surgery (MOS) procedure. METHODS We carried out a retrospective analysis of 402 patients who had undergone semi-rigid URS for ureteral calculi as a MOS procedure in our center between 2004 and 2012. Patients with previous DJ catheter were excluded. We classified the calculi according to their location (lumbar, pelvic, iliac), size (&lt; or&gt; 1cm) and number (single or multiple). Follow-up was done by plain X-ray of the abdomen and ultrasound one month after surgery. The procedure was considered successful when patients were free from the treated calculi or had ureteral fragments &lt; 3 mm one month after surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to identify the factors involved in success and hospitalization not being required. RESULTS A total of 269 patients were included. The majority of the stones were single (92.2%), &lt;1 cm in size (76.6%), pelvic (62.1%), and left-sided (57.2%). 89.6% of the procedures were performed as MOS and 82.2% were considered to be successful. In the multivariate analysis, left-sided (p&lt;0.001) and pelvic location of the calculi (p=0,01) were found to be independent predictors for the success of the procedure In terms of hospital admission, the only independent predictor was the presence of intraoperative complications ( p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS Left-sided and pelvic locations were the independent predictors for the success of the URS. A lack of intraoperative complications was the independent predictor for not requiring hospitalisation.</dc:description>
