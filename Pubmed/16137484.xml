<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hypertensive population. The aim of this study is to estimate the 10-year risk of a first stroke in Spanish hypertensive population using the Framingham scale. PATIENTS AND METHOD Cross-sectional multicenter study in primary care environment, on hypertensive patients aged 55 or more (10 consecutive patients each physician). Blood pressure (BP) was measured according to standardized rules. Stroke and coronary risk were estimated using the Framingham scale. RESULTS 16,129 patients (mean age 67.7 years; 57.1% women; 30.4% with diabetes mellitus; 26.6% with previous history of cardiovascular disease) were analyzed. 20.3% showed electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (more prevalent in males, diabetics, with systolic BP &gt; or = 140 mmHg; p &lt; 0.001). The goal of BP control was reached in 30.1% of non-diabetic patients and only in 5.9% of diabetics. The estimated 10-year risk of a first stroke (standard deviation) was estimated to be 19.9% (16.8), and the coronary risk 19.2% (14.0). While males had an estimated risk of coronary disease above the stroke risk, women had an estimated risk of a first stroke greater than the estimated risk of coronary disease. CONCLUSIONS The estimated risk of stroke among Spanish hypertensive population is high, and the main risk factors (age, systolic BP, diabetes and left ventricular hypertrophy) tend to aggregate. In women estimated risk of stroke in greater than estimated coronary risk. The risk of stroke must be taken into account in the assessment and treatment of hypertensive patients.</dc:description>
