<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The aim of this study is to analyse the costs of the treatment of a group of patients with severe injuries. The distribution of the costs between the different departments involved in the management of these patients is also investigated. MATERIAL AND METHOD The data from patients who suffered severe injuries, and recorded in the Traumasur data base, were prospectively gathered to be used in the study. The data from a total of 131 patients treated in the year 2008 were collected. Data obtained from the hospital finance office were also used, providing the overall cost as well as the separate costs of each of the departments involved in the treatment. RESULTS The injury severity score (ISS) and the new injury severity score (NISS) mean values were 31.8 and 39.4, respectively. The mortality rate was 17.5%. The overall costs of the patients was 3,791,879.3 €, with a mean cost per patient of 28,945 €. The mean percentage of the overall costs of the treatment incurred by the ICU and the ward was 62% and 12.7%, respectively. The cost of the ICU admission increased up to 68.4% in patients with an ISS&gt;40. Although the patients who died had more serious injuries, they had a lower cost in all areas. CONCLUSION Patients with multiple injuries represent a significant health cost, with the greater percentage being due to the hospital stay, particularly that in ICU. Other cost areas involve a lower percentage of the cost.</dc:description>
