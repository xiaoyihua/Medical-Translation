<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Although endemic goiter is an easily controlled chronic disease, it continues to be a serious global public health problem. AIM To study iodine nutrition in school age children from different areas of Chile. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Thyroid gland was palpated in 4181 school age children from Calama, Santiago, Temuco and Punta Arenas. Urinary iodine excretion was measured to 9% of these children and iodine concentration in salt for human consumption obtained in each of these areas was determined. RESULTS A 9% goiter prevalence in boys and 11% prevalence in girls was detected. The prevalence of goiter Ia was 6.5% and the figure in different geographic areas was similar. Iodine concentration in salt for human consumption was adequate according to Chilean legislation (82.6, 95.7, 96.8 and 93.2 micrograms ugI/g salt in Calama, Santiago, Temuco and Punta Arenas respectively). Urinary iodine excretion in boys and girls was 1695 and 1802 micrograms l/g creatinine in Calama, 680 and 732 in Santiago, 574 and 690 in Temuco, 570 and 528 in Punta Arenas. These values are well above recommendations. CONCLUSIONS Endemic goiter is no longer a problem in Chile. The importance of a continuous surveillance of iodine nutrition in Chile and the reduction of salt iodine concentration required by Chilean legislation is underscored.</dc:description>
