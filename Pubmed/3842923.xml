<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study deals with the development of a method to identify typical food dishes, successfully applied in the State of Sonora, Mexico. The State was divided into six regions considering the size of the territory and existence of different physical, economic and sociocultural conditions, and how they influence the consumption patterns. A list of 66 regional food dishes was prepared by interviewing housewives from different parts of Sonora who now lived in the city of Hermosillo. From this list, 47 dishes were identified as regionally consumed, and a State-wide survey was performed to determine their frequency of consumption. Based on the categories of "very frequently", "frequently" and "less frequently", a group of 15 dishes (2 per region, plus 3 dishes throughout the State) was selected. A questionnaire was used to obtain the different ways they had of preparing them. The "typical recipe" for each dish was also determined, using the mode as statistical parameter. Samples of these food dishes were prepared at the laboratory following the selected home recipes for proximal analysis and determination of their vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, phosphorus and iron content. The results showed that a portion of "gallina pinta" contributed more than 25% of the daily recommended intake established by the National Institute of Nutrition "Salvador Zubirán" (INNSZ) for an adult man for energy, protein, iron, niacin and 24.3% thiamine and 21.0% calcium. The "chivichangas de queso", for example, contributed 45.2% of the calcium requirement, and the "tamales de carne", 36% iron.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
