<dc:description xml:lang="en">Aspects of the growth and development were described for immature stages of Culex quinquefasciatus Say, 1826 (Diptera: Culicidae), an antropophilic mosquito species found frequently in Bogotá, Colombia. Two experiments were carried out during January-February and September-October of 2001 under ambient environmental conditions. Oviposition occured 5-8 days after blood ingestion. Females laid eggs in plastic containers filled with pooled water with high organic material content. The number of eggs per raft varied between 152 and 203. For the 2 trials, the hatch rate was 50% and 75%. The asynchronous egg hatch, the short duration of the pupal stage (11% of the total development time, and the high efficiency of adult emergence from the pupal stage (98.6%) were noted. In general, these development times were shorter compared to those reported by other authors. Moreover, the high percentages of hatch (83.6%), pupation (86.6%) and emergence (98.6%) under the average temperature conditions of 14.8 degrees C and 15.1 degrees C, and average relative humidity of 72.5% and 74.1%, respectively) demonstrated adaptation of C. quinquefasciatus to Bogotá's cool, high altitude environment. These characteristics, together with its vectorial capacity and the resistance to chemical control methods, could make this species become a risk for the health of human populations.</dc:description>
