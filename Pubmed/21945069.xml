<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of the 28/2005 Spanish smoking law on exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) in Barcelona. METHODS We performed a pre-post evaluation study. Two cross-sectional surveys were compared. Data were obtained from the Barcelona Health Surveys of 2000 and 2006. The prevalence of SHS exposure among non-smoking adults was analyzed by setting (home, workplace and leisure time) and sociodemographic variables. RESULTS SHS exposure in non-smokers significantly decreased between 2000 and 2006 (p &lt; 0.01). Odds ratios adjusted by sex, age and social class were 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6-0.8) for home and 0.2 (95% CI: 0.2-0.3) for workplace exposure in 2006 compared with 2000. In both settings, the decrease in exposure was greater in the higher social classes. After the implementation of the law, almost 50% of the population remained exposed to SHS during leisure time, younger people being the most exposed (83.5%). CONCLUSION After the implementation of the law, the prevalence of SHS exposure in non-smokers in Barcelona decreased significantly in workplaces and in the home. Nevertheless, nearly half of the population remained exposed to SHS during leisure time.</dc:description>
