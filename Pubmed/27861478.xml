<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mistreatment of medical students is an international problem that has been reported for decades in different countries, but its conceptualization and registration form are very heterogeneous. This review aims to identify the main features of this mistreatment from a systematic analysis of the literature published between 1980 and 2016. Using databases, 118 published papers were obtained under the selected criteria. Most widely accepted definitions are presented and structuring of the following categories: directionality, types, perpetrators, scenarios, vulnerable groups, consequences, complaints, and the way they justify mistreatment. Concluding, in order to bring down abuse in medical students, it is proposed to replace the verticality and submission by teamwork and collaboration among all, and promote strategies of complaint and admonition of the perpetrator.</dc:description>
