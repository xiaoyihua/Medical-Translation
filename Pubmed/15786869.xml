<dc:description xml:lang="en">Environmental mycobacteria (EM) constitute an important group of bacteria species found in the environment. They can colonize and occasionally produce disease in man. Sixteen thousand three hundred samples from 9300 adult symptomatic patients from the Hospital Regional of Tuberculosis in Cordoba were bacteriolocally investigated. The isolations were performed by culture on Lowenstein Jensen and Stonebrink culture media. The colonies of acid fast bacilli (AFB) were identified by biochemical and molecular tests. Among 716 culture positive cases, 684 (95.5%) were due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and 32 to environmental mycobacteria. Serial samples allowed the confirmation of the etiological agent in culture and correlated with consistent clinical and radiological abnormalities. Seventy-five percent of these patients were affected by M. avium complex, 15.6% by M. fortuitum, 3.1% Mycobacterium kansasii and 6.3% Mycobacterium chelonae. Among tuberculosis cases, 94.5% and 5.5% had pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease respectively.</dc:description>
