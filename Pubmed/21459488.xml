<dc:description xml:lang="en">PET-CT has the inherent methodological difficulty of having to report on two different diagnostic modalities combined and fused into one. Therefore, the PET-CT report may be very extensive and sometimes even confusing for the referring physicians. In order to make a clear and concise written transcription of the results, a standardized, formatted report ("PET-CT-compact-report") is proposed and discussed. In this way, better acceptance of the PET/CT report can be obtained from the referring physicians. This could also provide a positive influence on health administrators to make the decision to extend the use of PET-CT equipment to the majority of the hospitals.</dc:description>
