<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this study was to adapt and apply a battery of neuropsychological tests administered by computer. The study comprised three phases: 1) An existing system (NES-2) was revised and adapted (mainly in its Spanish version, since the structure and time intervals were the same). 2) A pilot group of 18 subjects was administered the five selected tests. 3) A comparative study of 36 exposed workers with 40 unexposed controls was undertaken. It was concluded that computer-administered tests are acceptable and economic. No significant differences were found between exposed. The possible reasons for the negative findings are discussed, as well as the types of future studies that need to be carried out.</dc:description>
