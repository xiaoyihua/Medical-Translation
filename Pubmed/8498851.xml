<dc:description xml:lang="en">Carcinoma of the prostate has been treated by monochemotherapy, polychemotherapy, intraarterial chemotherapy, combined chemo and hormone therapy and growth factor antagonists. Difficulties exist in evaluating the efficacy of chemotherapy due to the scant number of patients treated and the different criteria used to assess response. Monochemotherapy has achieved a response rate (complete and partial) of less than 20% in randomized studies and that obtained with polychemotherapy is only slightly higher. The studies that have been conducted comparing these two treatment modalities have not clearly demonstrated the superiority of the latter. The duration of response is short and is measured in weeks. There is no standard treatment. Adriamycin, fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide appear to be the most effective cytostatic agents. There is no evidence that chemotherapy improves survivorship, and in comparison to symptomatic treatment, the former has been superior. The combination of chemotherapy with hormone therapy as a first line of treatment can improve the response rate slightly and enhance survivorship, although further studies are warranted to determine this definitely. Recruitment with androgens increases the response, but may entail risks. The growth factor antagonists have extended the therapeutic possibilities in prostate carcinoma, but further studies are warranted to determine its true value.</dc:description>
