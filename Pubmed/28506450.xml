<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The supraclavicular island flap is a rotational pedicled flap and may have some advantages in head and neck reconstruction compared with free-tissue transfer when this kind of reconstruction is not affordable or recommended. MATERIAL AND METHODS We present our experience during the year 2016 in the application of the supraclavicular island flap in five cases as an alternative to microvascular reconstruction in several defects after resection of head and neck tumours. In two patients, the flap was used to close the surgical pharyngostoma after total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy. In one patient, it was used in lateral facial reconstruction after partial resection of the temporal bone. In one case, it was used to close a skin defect after total laryngectomy with prelaryngeal tissue extension. And in the last case to close a neck skin defect after primary closure of a pharyngo-cutaneous fistula. There were no flap complications, and the result was satisfactory in all cases. RESULTS The supraclavicular artery island flap is useful and versatile in head and neck reconstruction. Operating room time in aged patients or those with comorbidities will be reduced compared to free flaps. The surgical technique is relatively easy and can be used for skin and mucosal coverage. CONCLUSION The supraclavicular island flap could be a recommended option in head and neck reconstruction, its use seems to be increasing and provides a safe and time-saving option to free flaps in selected patients.</dc:description>
