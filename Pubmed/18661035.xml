<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The presence of family members during procedures is a controversial topic. Despite the widespread perception of its benefits, procedures are often carried out in places with restricted access. OBJECTIVES 1. To know parent s and caregiver s opinion about their presence during the performance of invasive procedures. 2. To determine the reasons to justify or deny their presence. Materials and methods. INCLUSION CRITERIA parents and caregivers of children admited to Hospital Municipal Materno Infantil de San Isidro "Dr. Carlos Gianantonio" and Sanatorio "Mater Dei". DESIGN transversal study. Anonymous survey. RESULTS One hundred and seventy eight surveys were delivered and 172 were recovered. The average age of respondents was 33.75 years, 80.81% were women, 98.84% had children. The relationship to the patient: mother 70.93%, father 18.02%, grandparents 6.4%, uncle 2.33% and sibling 2.33%. The desire to be present at the different procedures was always greater than 50%. There is an inverse relationship with the invasiveness of the procedure: endovenous access 88.95%, laceration repair (sutures) 78.49%, lumbar puncture 73.84%, endotracheal intubation 56.98% and cardiopul-monary resuscitation 58.72%. Similar results were obtained for unconscious child. The most frequently reasons to justify the presence are emotional containment of the child and procedure monitoring. CONCLUSIONS 1) The majority of respondents wanted to be present. 2) There is an inverse relationship between the desire of the family and level of invasiveness. 3) There are not significant differences comparing conscious or unconscious child.</dc:description>
