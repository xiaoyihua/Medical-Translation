<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES To determine whether adults in Madrid, Spain adhere to leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) recommendations and to identify factors associated with adherence. METHODS A telephone survey of 12,037 individuals, representative of the Madrid population aged 18-64 years, was conducted. The LTPA level was quantified in metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week from answers to a questionnaire on the frequency and duration of LTPA. This level was compared with the recommendation to engage in at least moderate activity &gt;or=150 min/week or vigorous activity &gt;or=60 min/week. Factors associated with adherence to the recommendation were identified using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The mean LTPA level was 17.3 MET-hours/ week (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.9-17.7 MET-hours/week) and 28.8% (95% CI, 28%-29.7%) adhered to the recommendation. The recommended level was achieved more frequently in men than women (odds ratio [OR]=2.41; 95% CI, 2.20-2.64). In comparison with younger individuals, adherence decreased gradually with age until 60-64 years, when the OR was 0.20 (95% CI, 0.15-0.25). Compared with less well-educated individuals, the university-educated were more likely to meet the recommendation (OR=2.28; 95% CI, 1.82-2.87). Obese individuals achieved it less frequently (OR=0.49; 95% CI, 0.40-0.61) than normal-weight individuals. Those whose job involved low-intensity physical activity achieved it more frequently than those with sedentary occupations (OR=1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.34). CONCLUSIONS The majority of adults in Madrid did not achieve the recommended LTPA level. Adherence was lower in women, older individuals, the less well-educated and the obese, while it was greater in those with a job involving low-intensity physical activity.</dc:description>
