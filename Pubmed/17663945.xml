<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Nasal polyposis with chronic rhinosinusitis is classified as a subset of chronic rhinosinusitis. The goal of this study is to assess the results of endoscopic sinonasal surgery at our hospital for nasal polyposis with chronic rhinosinusitis. PATIENTS AND METHOD In this review of 110 patients affected by chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps treated with endoscopic sinus surgery, we focus on symptoms, degree of involvement, sinus opacity (Lund-Mackay grading system), complications, rate of improvements, and recurrences. RESULTS Major complications did not occur. Minor complications occurred in 21 patients (19 %) with the most frequent being adhesion. Patients who suffered from asthma, aspirin intolerance, or both were related to a greater rate of recurrences. The endoscopic surgery of recurrences was not linked to a greater rate of failures. In our study, the complications rate was not related to revision surgery. The severity grading used in nasal endoscopy correlated well to the grading assigned by computerized tomography. CONCLUSIONS The presence of asthma, aspirin intolerance, or both adversely affect endoscopic sinus surgery outcome. In this review, the rate of complications is not related to revision surgery. The staging used relates well the degree of occupation shown by the nasal endoscopy to that given by computerized tomography.</dc:description>
