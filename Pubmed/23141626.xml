<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Patients with hip fracture (HF), due to their characteristics, require a specific support. The Acute Orthogeriatric Unit (OGU) has been shown to be one of the most beneficial. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the main variables of HF patients treated at an OGU and compare them with the previous referral model (RC). MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective observational study with retrospective control was conducted on 169 patients, split into two groups. In the RC group, patients were admitted to conventional trauma ward. In the OGU group, an early geriatric assessment was performed, and patients were simultaneously attended daily by the orthopaedic surgeon, nurse and geriatrician, and the surgery times, work load, discharge and destination, were planned in a weekly meeting with the rest of professionals. RESULTS A total of 71 patients were included in the RC group and 96 in the OGU group. The preoperative characteristics were similar, except for a slightly higher comorbidity in the OGU group. The OGU patients were operated on earlier (3.82±2.08 vs 4.61±2.5 days; P&lt;.32), and overall hospital stay was reduced by 28% (11.84±4.04 vs 16.46±8.4 days; P&lt;.001). The functional efficiency (Barthel Index at discharge-Barthel Index at admission/overall stay - stay before surgery) was higher in the OGU group (1.56±0.7 vs 2.61±1.1; P&lt;.05). There were no differences in functional status, mortality or discharge location. CONCLUSIONS The OGU is a level of care that provides effective medical care in HF patients in general hospitals.</dc:description>
