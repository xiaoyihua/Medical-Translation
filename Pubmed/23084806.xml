<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular causes in patients with schizophrenia is higher than in the general population, a fact that has been observed more since second generation anti-psychotics came into general use. OBJECTIVES To determine the incidence of metabolic syndrome in patients with a previously untreated first psychotic episode, as well as the prospective changes in the parameters that define the criteria of metabolic syndrome. METHOD An observational study with a prospective cohort design including patients who were admitted to the Acute Unit of Donostia Hospital. RESULTS A total of 21 patients were included in the study, of which 19 completed it. Just over one-quarter (26.3%) of the patients developed a metabolic syndrome at six months. Statistically significant differences were observed in the following parameters: 1) abdominal perimeter measurement with an increase of 14.6 cm at six months (P=.001); 2) triglyceride levels with a mean increase over the initial measurement of 48.99 mg/dl (P=.039); and 3) fasting blood glucose levels with a mean increase of 10.72 mg/dl (P=.001). CONCLUSIONS Significant changes were observed in metabolic parameters in a short period with the subsequent risk of associated cardiovascular events in a group of young patients. Actions are required directed at ensuring appropriate monitoring of these patients in order to measures to minimise the risks.</dc:description>
