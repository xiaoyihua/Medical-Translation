<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To find in our population with diabetes mellitus (DM) the prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, as well as their degree of control. METHOD A cross-sectional study was carried out in 15-82 years population of our health coverage area, by means of a mailed survey sent to a simple random sample composed of 33,022 individuals, and a interview with collection of exploration and analitic data to a 495 people sub-sample. RESULTS Among patients with DM 47/ have history of hypertension, and 58/ blood pressure =140/90 mmHg. Only 33/ have values &lt;130/85 mmHg, and the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure is significantly inferior between the women. There is history of hipercholesterolaemia in 45 210 / of diabetic patients versus 19/ of non-diabetic population; in the former group the total and LDL cholesterol levels are significantly lower. Smoking affects equally to both groups, while obesity and central obesity are more frequent between diabetic patients, although only in the case of women. CONCLUSIONS In our diabetic population blood pressure control is limited: two third parts of the patients show values above recommended. This fact forms a contrast with a high degree of dyslipidemia control. We should pay a greater attention to hypertension treatment in patients with diabetes, mainly in women, and promote smoking cessation interventions essentially in males.</dc:description>
