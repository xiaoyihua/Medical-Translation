<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the results achieved with vacuum devices in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. METHODS A telephone survey was conducted on 150 patients undergoing treatment with a vacuum device. Of these, 89 responded; 79 of which were considered valid for the study. The duration and frequency of use, side effects and degree of patient and partner satisfaction were analyzed. Mean follow-up was 59.5 months. RESULTS There were 14 dropouts early in the course of treatment. The remaining 65 patients used the device for a mean duration of 34.6 months, 3.7 times monthly. 63.3% of the patients achieved erection in more than half of the attempts. The most frequent side effects were pain (27 patients) and ecchymosis (7 patients). Forty-eight patients discontinued treatment at 10.8 months' mean follow-up. The most common causes for discontinuing treatment were lack of efficacy, refusal of the partner and pain. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of erectile dysfunction with the vacuum constriction device should be utilized as an alternative to intracavernosal drug-induced erection therapy when oral therapy fails or is contraindicated. A male with a stable partner and impotence arising from venous leakage or mild cavernous artery insufficiency is the ideal candidate.</dc:description>
