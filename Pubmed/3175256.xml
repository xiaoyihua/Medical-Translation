<dc:description xml:lang="en">The body growth and the onset of puberty in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in normotensive controls (WKY) have been studied. In female rats the onset of puberty was determined by both the age and the body weight at which the vaginal opening and first estrus appeared, as well as the ability of estradiol and progesterone to induce pituitary LH release. For this purpose females were injected with estradiol benzoate (0.1 mg/kg) and progesterone (1 mg/rat). Control animals received only oil vehicle. In male rats, puberty was assessed by studying the age and body weight at the time of balano-preputial separation. In another experiment, SH and WKY rats were decapitated on day 30 to determine FSH, LH, PRL, GH and testosterone plasma levels in males and FSH and LH in females. The results obtained show: a) A greater body weight, at all the ages studied (every 4 days between days 28 and 92) in SHR animals. b) A delay in vaginal opening and first estrus presentation in SHR females. c) Absence of spontaneous LH peaks in WKY females. d) Advancement in balano-preputial separation in SHR males and e) Higher plasma FSH levels in SHR males than in WKY males, without differences in other hormones.</dc:description>
