<dc:description xml:lang="en">The advent of biological therapies has revolutionized the management of rheumatoid arthritis, demonstrating effectiveness in controlling clinical and radiological damage. However, 20 to 40% of the patients will not respond to these therapies, which are associated to a very high cost. In addition, non-responder patients are exposed to possible adverse effects. For these reasons, we need to identify predictors of response to these treatments. These predictors are reviewed in this evidence-based paper and classified into genetic and non-genetic. Despite extensive search, nowadays there are no predictors powerful enough to be used in regular clinical practice. Serum factors, the presence of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, are the only factors currently being used to predict the response to specific biological therapy. In the future, probably thanks to new technologies based on genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, it will be possible to identify genetic predictors of response to biological drugs that will allow us to select suitable patients for a specific biological therapy.</dc:description>
