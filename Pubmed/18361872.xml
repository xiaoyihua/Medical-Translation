<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe trends in lung cancer mortality in Spain between 1980 and 2005. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data on deaths from lung cancer during the study period were obtained from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics. Global and truncated (35 to 64 years) age-specific and gender-specific mortality rates were calculated and expressed as rates per 100,000 person-years. Trends were analyzed using joinpoint regression models. RESULTS In 2005 in Spain, 16 647 men and 2471 women died from lung cancer, accounting for 26.6% and 6.6%, respectively, of all cancer deaths. In men, truncated mortality rates initially increased in the 1980-1992 period (3.1% per year; P&lt;.05) but began to decrease in the 1992-2005 period (-0.8% per year, P&lt;.05). Starting in the 1990s, age-specific mortality rates showed a statistically significant decrease in patients aged less than 85 years. For women, after an initial stable period, truncated mortality rates increased significantly from 1992 onward by 6.3% per year. The analysis by age groups showed that the rates increased in all age groups, except for patients aged 25 to 34 years and patients aged 75 to 84 years, in whom they remained stable. CONCLUSIONS While lung cancer mortality began to decrease slightly among Spanish men 15 years ago, it increased significantly among women during the same period.</dc:description>
