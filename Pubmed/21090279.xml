<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dietary fiber and antioxidants are food constituents and functional ingredients that are generally addressed separately. Nowadays there is scientific evidence that primary characteristics of DF assigned to non starch polysaccharides and lignin (resistance to digestion and absorption in the small intestine and fermentation in the large intestine) can be extended to other indigestible food constituents that are resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine with complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine. The antioxidant dietary fiber concept was defined as a dietary fiber concentrate containing significant amounts of natural antioxidants associated with non digestible compounds. Hibiscus sabdariffa L flower shows in its composition an important percentage of dietary fiber and high antioxidant capacity. The infusion obtained by decoction of flowers, had been extensibility studied due to the healthy properties. In this work the principal nutritional aspects from Hibiscus sabdariffa L and its use as a possible antioxidant dietary fiber source had been considered.</dc:description>
