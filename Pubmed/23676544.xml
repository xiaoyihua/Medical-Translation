<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The basaloid carcinoma of the prostate (BC) is a rare malignant neoplasm arising from the basal cells of prostatic ducts and acini. We report a case and review the literature. METHODS A 76-year-old man presented with symptoms of lower obstructive uropathy, the IPSS score was 29 and prostate specific antigen (PSA)of 0,924 ng /ml. Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) was performed in September 2008, histopathological diagnosis was BC. In February 2009 laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was performed. RESULTS Histopathological examination revealed a BC with adenoid cystic growth pattern, perineural infiltration and focal involvement of the left seminal vesicle. Immunohistochemically, the cells were negative for PSA, stained and were strongly positive for specific monoclonal antibodies anti-cytokeratin 34βE12, p63 and BCL-2. The patient has 23 months of follow-up, with complete continence and no evidence of tumor recurrence. CONCLUSIONS The BC is an extremely rare subtype of malignant tumors of the prostate, where immunohistochemistry plays a fundamental role in diagnosis.</dc:description>
