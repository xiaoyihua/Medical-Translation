<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The excess of pediatric emergencies going to hospitals has been the subject of many studies in Spain and, on some occasions, this problem has attributed to the inefficiency of pediatric primary care. Our main objective was to evaluate whether or not our community health center is an efficient filter for hospital emergencies. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a prospective one year long study of all pediatric emergency demands within our normal office hours (workdays, from 08:00 to 21:00 hours). RESULTS The total number of emergencies amounted to 1,294, with an average of 5.78 per day. The largest inflow occurred in September and the lowest in August. Most of the emergencies were between 16:00 and 19:00 hours. Fifty percent of the patients were under 4 years of age. We made 86 different diagnoses according to the WONCA classification. Only 10 diagnoses came with a frequency superior to 3%, and 60% of the emergencies were related to one of these 10 diagnoses. Of all pediatric emergencies, 94.7% were completely resolved by us. Only 60 patients (4.6%) were sent-on to hospital emergency services. Among these patients, 40 required traumatological or surgical attention, 5 ophthalmological care, 3 otorhinolaryngological care, and only 12 exclusively needed pediatric attention. In 55.7% of the cases there was no reason to use the emergency channel. CONCLUSIONS During our office hours, our community health center is an efficient filter for hospital pediatric emergencies.</dc:description>
