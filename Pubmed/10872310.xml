<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS The exercise-induced bronchoespasm, also called asthma for exercise, it corresponds to a frequent clinical entity that commonly accompanies the asthmatic patient. Their frequency is of around the 80 to 90% for the patients with asthma; it is presented among 40 to 50% of the children with allergic rhinitis, in the athletes 14% and in the population's 12% in general. OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of a heating routine like preventive agent of the exercise-induced bronchoespasm. METHOD 30 patients were included of between 10 and 16 years of age, asthmatic and with exercise-induced bronchoespasm by diagnosed by means of challenge test to the exercise. All the patients carried out an exercise routine with duration of 20 minutes during which movements of elasticity, calisthenics and light activity were made directed to the exercise to develop, taking as objective parameter 60% of the frequency heart submax. Did all the patients carry out challenge at once, again to the exercise, in which a band numberless was used, with speeds that were increased progressively from 1 to 8 km/h and with inclination of 0? 10 0. The spirometrics registrations was made before the challenge and at the 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 60 minutes after the same one. RESULTS The average of the patient's age was of 12.8 +/- 2 years with size of 157 +/- 10 cm. CONCLUSION The heating in children with broncoespasmo induced by exercise acts as a protective agent against the decrement of the VEF-1. Although the heating can be a good control method in the asthmatic patient, it is necessary to keep in mind that not all the patients have a benefit of this protection. This can only be used in patient with programmed physical activity, since in the preschoolers it is not possible to implant a heating routine for the characteristics characteristic of their activity.</dc:description>
