<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The hematuria, one of the main motives of urologic consultations, is produced by an extensive number of urinary pathologies from infections to cancer. The management of hematuria can require the action of Interventional Radiology in those cases in which the pathology is outside of surgery therapy. This is an approximation less invasive for the management of this pathology. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective review of 6 cases of supraselective embolization of bladder arteries with micropaticles in intractable macroscopic hematuria with associated anemia. Short and extensive monitoring. RESULTS Four patients had a favorable evolution, with disappearance of macroscopic hematuria at 48 hours of the procedure. In two cases it was necessary a second endovascular procedure (coils) one week later. The patients did not present complications related to the intervention during the period of current monitoring. CONCLUSION In ineligible patients for surgical resolution of hematuria or in those with failure of habitual processing, the selective embolization seems to be a viable alternative and without immediate complications for the management. Studies with greater number of cases and more prolonged monitoring are required to test this hypothesis.</dc:description>
