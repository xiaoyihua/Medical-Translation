<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two hundred and twenty-nine patients operated for genuine stress urinary incontinence by two surgical techniques, were studied. Risk factors were analyzed: age, gesta, para, and added gynecological pathology. They were placed in two groups. Group I formed by operated patients with Pereyra's technique (136), and Group II operated by Burch's technique (93). There were no differences as far as general characteristics of patients in both groups. More frequent added pathologies for Group I were pelvic statics changes, and for Group II, uterine myomatosis. Technically there were no advantages for one technique as compared with the other one, independently of indications for each one.</dc:description>
