<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic surgery requires a long training period of time in which the complexity of the training is increased. GOALS The technique presented in this paper has been developed in order to find an experimental model that allows us to improve the learning of the vascular suture. Our main goal was to evaluate this technique as an experimental model for the vacular anastomosis, not to obtain a functional autotransplant. In this regard, here we summarize our experience during the first two cases performed. MATERIAL AND METHODS Laparoscopic renal autotransplant was perfomed in female lab pigs weighing 15-20 kg. International Experimental Animal Care rules were accomplished. RESULTS After sacrifizing the animals, only one case of vascular thrombosis was observed. The other cases showed normal arterial and venous flow. CONCLUSIONS Experimental Renal Laparoscopic autotransplant constitutes a good surgical model. We are trying to implement the technique in the clinics in the next future.</dc:description>
