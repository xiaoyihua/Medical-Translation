<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the casuistics of left atrial myxoma with emphasis on results and follow-up. METHOD We reviewed the clinical records of patients operated in the Hospital Cardiac Myxomas South Central High Specialty (HCSAE) of PEMEX in the last 7 years, with an emphasis on results and follow-up. RESULTS The analysis showed 10 patients, of whom 60% were female and 40% male, with ages from 12 to 76 years, with a mean age of 50 years. In the clinical characteristics of patients predominated dyspnea in 90%, followed by fatigue (80%) and chest pain (60%). The incidence was 90% for the left atrium and 10% for the right atrium, had tumors less than 3cm to up to over 10cm (average of 6 to 7cm). The pathology report was myxoma in the 100% of cases, the morbidity and early mortality was 0%, with a mean hospital stay of 6 days, and a patient of 12 years of age recurred and underwent surgery five months later. The 5-year survival was 100%. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of myxomas is well known for rare presentation, the experience in this national medical center is one patient for every 350 operations, one case per year with no mortality and excellent survival.</dc:description>
