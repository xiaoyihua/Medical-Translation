<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mothers with autoimmune diseases (AID) may have exacerbations of their disease during pregnancy and postpartum period, with fetal implications and neonatal complications. The aim of this study was to describe miscarriages during pregnancy and postpartum problems among mothers with AID and associated neonatal pathology. Retrospective data was recorded from 2004 to 2010. 29 mothers with AID were analyzed, 65% of whom had lupus erythematosus (SLE). There were 52 pregnancies, which resulted in 39 newborns. There were 10 instances of maternal complications (25.6%) during the pregnancies, including 1 with digital vasculitis, 1 with pancreatitis, 1 outbreak of glomerulonephritis, 1 case of gestational diabetes, 2 patients at risk for preterm birth, 3 with preeclampsia and 1 with eclampsia. During the postpartum period, there was one case of SLE exacerbation. Among the newborns 20.5% had low birth weight and 4 exhibited the transplacental passage of maternal antibodies with one case of neonatal lupus. Among complications beyond the neonatal period, 8 (20.5%) children developed asthma, one presented negative ANA oligoarthritis and another presented immune thrombocytopenic purpura. In our hospital, the rates of miscarriage, prematurity and LBW among the newborns of mothers with AID are similar to those reported in the literature. The observation of a case of NL with the transplacental passage of anti-Sm is remarkable.</dc:description>
