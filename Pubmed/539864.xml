<dc:description xml:lang="en">A radioimmunoassay procedure for testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in blood and semen plasma was developed using antisera against both androgens. The method utilized 0.5 ml and 1.0 ml volumes of blood plasma and semen respectively, and satisfies the recognized criteria of reliability. Determinations of T and DHT were performed on 33 healthy male unmarried subjects, aged 21-25 years old, and then compared to the sperm count. The T/DHT blood ratio was 7.8 and the correlation was r = 0.50, P less than 0.01, while the T/DHT semen ratio was 0.42 and the correlation r = 0.55, P less than 0.01. The T/DHT, blood/semen ratio was 10.8. No significant relationship was observed either between blood plasma androgens or semen plasma androgens and sperm concentrations.</dc:description>
