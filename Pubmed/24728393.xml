<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND HIV/AIDS is a chronic infection that transcends the biological domain and affects social relations, mental health, financial aspects and quality of life. The objective of the study was to assess the perception of Health Related Quality Of Life (HRQOL)) in people with HIV / AIDS. METHODS Systematic review with meta-analysis. We applied a research protocol in four multidisciplinary databases: Pubmed, Science direct, Lilacs y Scielo; with search terms WHOQOL-BREF, WHOQOL-HIV-BREF, WHOQOLBREF-HIV. Quality assessment of articles was done by two researchers to ensure the completeness and reproducibility. HRQL was measured on a scale of 0 (worst outcome) to 100 points. The analysis was based on frequencies, summary measures, confidence intervals, and Student t test. RESULTS The study included 19 studies with 3,348 people from 11 countries. The average of hrql was between 59 and 64 points, the lowest score was the environmental dimension with 59 points and the greater psychological health with 64 points. In the sensitivity analysis we found changes of 0 and 5 points between overall score and the observed data by excluding each individual study. We found good convergent validity on the dimensions common to both instruments evaluated, with differences of less than 3 points. CONCLUSION hrql scores in people with HIV/aids were good (greater than 50) which implies that proper management can reduce the negative effects on the physical health, psychological health, socials relations, the environment, independence level and spirituality.</dc:description>
