<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To relate knowledge about AIDS to the worry and fear caused by normal everyday situations, in which someone seropositive or with AIDS is involved, but when the virus cannot be transmitted. To find the discrimination that exists towards HIV carriers and people with AIDS. DESIGN A basically descriptive crossover observation study. SETTING Educational centres in the city of Castellón. PARTICIPANTS 628 adolescents found by multi-stage conglomerate sampling. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS A self-filled questionnaire was used. The items involving behaviour through which the virus was not transmitted, and for which the knowledge, worry and fear generated were evaluated, were described analytically. Items concerning discriminatory attitudes were analysed. Although we detected a lack of knowledge, the worry and fear generated by each situation was greater. In over 75% of those polled we observed discriminatory attitudes. CONCLUSIONS We detected important divergences between knowledge about paths of non-transmission, and the anxiety and fear generated. Perhaps the preventive campaigns have contributed knowledge about the paths of contagion, but it is clear that they have not helped to modify discriminatory attitudes towards people with HIV or AIDS.</dc:description>
