<dc:description xml:lang="en">CONTEXT Bladder cancer is the cause of more than 150,000 deaths per year. The overall rate of survival is approximately 45%, with a 10-year recurrence-free rate of 50-59%, with no changes in the last decade. OBJECTIVE Due to a lack of agreement on the follow-up of cystectomy or on a uniform treatment when faced with the various types of recurrence, we have analysed the most recent literature in an attempt to unify the criteria for the diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer. ACQUISITION OF EVIDENCE Review of Spanish and English publications in the medical literature in the last 10 years, highlighting the most significant series in terms of the number of patients, follow-up time, as well as the existing meta-analyses. SYNTHESIS OF THE EVIDENCE Recurrence after cystectomy can occur in the urinary apparatus (upper urinary tract or distal urethra) and local (cystectomy bed) and/or distant metastases. Despite strict control, more than 60% of the relapses are discovered based on symptoms and not by the routine follow-up test. Locoregional and distant relapses are more common the more advanced the stage at the time of cystectomy, going from 11-21% in pT2N0 to 52-72% when there is lymphocytic N+ involvement. Recurrence in the urethra and/or upper urinary track has other prognostic factors such as multiplicity, the presence of Cis and involvement of prostatic stroma. There are various treatments for tumour relapses. Increasingly, the patient's comorbidity is considered when deciding on the therapeutic strategy. Treatments are typically multimodal and include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. CONCLUSION The follow-up of patients who undergo cystectomy should be individualised, taking into account the prognostic factors of recurrence and the patient's comorbidity, assuming that in some cases, multimodal treatment is indicated.</dc:description>
