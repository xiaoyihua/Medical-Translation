<dc:description xml:lang="en">Registries estimate that one third of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are "resistant" to of TNF-alpha blockers. Therefore, the search for new approaches to treatment of this disease may be justified. Currently the treatment options that have proven effective are associated with inhibition of the T cell costimulatory pathway (abatacept and alefacept) and blocking the P40 fraction of IL-12 and IL-23 (ustekinumab). A novel pathway inhibition, which deserves special attention is offered by apremilast. This molecule inhibits phosphodiesterase IV, responsible for hydrolyzing cyclic adenosine monophosphate to adenosine monophosphate, which causes an increase in cAMP. This metabolite is associated with decreased TNF-alpha. It has a modest efficacy (ACR 20 response of 43%), and subsequent studies have shown an improvement in visual analog scale and the SF36 compared to placebo. Currently there are five clinical trials in phase III to assess its effectiveness in parameters of inflammation and radiographic progression. The spectrum of possibilities before treatment failure with anti-TNF alpha, is augmented by the appearance of several reports that show efficacy with the individual use of CD20 inhibitors and IL-1. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the effectiveness of molecules that inhibit signal transduction of cytokines (Anti-JAK) has been proven, so it is possible that in the future they may be used in patients with PsA.</dc:description>
