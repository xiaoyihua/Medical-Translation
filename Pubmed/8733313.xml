<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To assess prospectively the effects of a controlled program of inspiratory muscle training program and nutritional support in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD). PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-three patients with COPD were randomly assigned into four groups. Group I received a 1000 kcal/day nutritional supplement, given as a casein based enteral nutritional formula; group III was subjected to inspiratory muscle training, using an inexpensive pressure threshold load valve constructed according to the Appropriate Technology principles of the WHO, adjusted at 30% of Maximal Inspiratory Mouth Pressure and received also the nutritional supplement; group IV was trained but did not receive the nutritional supplement and group II was not trained nor supplemented. Patients were studied during three months and monthly, inspiratory muscle function, exercise capacity and anthropometry were measured. RESULTS A significant improvement in exercise capacity, maximal inspiratory pressure and inspiratory muscle endurance was observed in the four groups throughout the study. Trained subjects had greater improvement in their inspiratory muscle endurance, compared to untrained subjects. Nutritional support had no effect in inspiratory muscle function or exercise capacity. No changes in anthropometric measures were observed. CONCLUSIONS The pressure threshold load valve used in this study, improved inspiratory muscle endurance and nutritional support had no effect in patients with COPD.</dc:description>
