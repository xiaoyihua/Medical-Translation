<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Strokes are the leading cause of epileptic seizures in adults and account for 50% of seizures in those over the age of 65. These patients present certain specific characteristics with respect to the remaining population, which makes it necessary to look for medication that are suited to their particular case. AIM To describe the effectiveness and safety of levetiracetam (LEV) in monotherapy in elderly patients with post-stroke epileptic seizures. PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective evaluation was conducted of a series of cases consisting of patients over the age of 60 years who had suffered a stroke and had had at least one epileptic seizure in the late post-stroke phase (more than two weeks). Demographic data and the characteristics of the epilepsy and the stroke were collected. Patients began treatment with LEV in monotherapy, underwent check-ups at one and six months of treatment, and the effectiveness and safety of the drug were evaluated. RESULTS The sample consisted of 25 patients with a mean age of 75.2 +/- 7.6 years. They presented an average of 3.2 +/- 5.6 post-stroke seizures and the time elapsed since the stroke was 38.3 +/- 81.8 months. After six months' follow-up, 76% of the patients were still receiving treatment with LEV. Of the patients under treatment, 89.5% were free from seizures. Side effects that could be attributed to LEV were noted by 28% of patients, but did not compel them to stop treatment. CONCLUSIONS LEV in monotherapy can be a safe, effective therapeutic option for elderly patients who have presented epilepsy following a stroke.</dc:description>
