<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To investigate the predictive ability of "core addiction-related beliefs" and "craving-related beliefs" on the desire to take drugs based on the cognitive model of addiction. In addition, we analyzed more in depth the influence of duration of abstinence on the degree of identification of participants with these beliefs and the intensity of craving. METHODS We used three different questionnaires in order to measure: the intensity of the craving experienced by participants, and the degree to which they identify with "core addiction-related beliefs" and "craving-related beliefs". The sample was made up of 130 drug abusers with different main drugs of choice, course of addiction, duration of abstinence and gender. RESULTS The "core addiction-related beliefs", together with clinical variables such as the main drug of choice and the duration of abstinence, significantly predicted the intensity of craving experienced by participants. The intensity of craving and the degree to which participants identify with "core addiction-related beliefs" and "craving-related beliefs" differed significantly as a function of duration of abstinence; this effect was due to the fact that patients with shorter abstinence periods were more likely to endorse these beliefs. "Core addiction-related beliefs" can significantly predict not only intensity of craving but also the degree to which participants identify with "craving-related beliefs". CONCLUSIONS "Core addiction-related beliefs" constitute the best predictor of intensity of craving across treatment, and may therefore be highly relevant for difficulties in controlling craving, as proposed by the Beck cognitive model of addiction. This association may help to explain why some patients have a persistent desire to take drugs even after protracted abstinence, when a lack of desire for drugs would be expected.</dc:description>
