<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Cell cultures provide a good model for studying lung diseases but they are difficult to reproduce and the number of cells obtained is limited. The aim of this study was to develop a way to increase the production of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) in primary cultures. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 12 samples (9 from surgical specimens and 3 from endoscopic biopsies) were processed on plates coated with type I collagen with growth medium supplemented for BEC. When cell proliferation started, the explants were removed for successive subculturing. The remaining cells were left to proliferate and were trypsinized after 50% confluence. We recorded the number of cells obtained, cell viability, and the percentage positive for cytokeratin 7. RESULTS The total number of cells obtained by this method was 3-fold the number of human BEC obtained with simple primary cultures. The maximum number of subcultures was 5, mean (SD) cell viability was 91.9% (11.7%), and the percentage of cells positive for cytokeratin 7 was 30.71% (10.68%). CONCLUSIONS The described method for expanding primary BEC cultures increases cell production.</dc:description>
