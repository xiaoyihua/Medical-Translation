<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE to compare the fatigue in a stress test at high temperature and humidity in eight healthy volunteers. METHODS the time of pedaling on the ergometer cycle was measured to know the exercise's efficiency at 30 km/h until the volunteers presented exhaustion or their heart frequency increased to &gt; 160 beats/min. A basal test in the tunnel's ventilation of the Naica mine at 37.5°C and 40 % humidity was done. We repeated the stress test at the entrance of the cave, where temperature was 44°C and 80 % humidity. We compared using the protector equipment with ice and cold air breathing suit. RESULTS the stress test al 44°C and 80 % humidity with the protector suit was interrupted in 75 % of participants because of an increase in the heart frequency (&gt; 160 per minute) The exercise time was duplicated in 62 % and was increased in 100% of the participants with an average increase of 2.25 times and a rank of (1.12-3.3). Using the statistical Wilcoxon test the differences between the times of stress test with and without equipment at 44°C and 80 % humidity had a Z of 2.52 and a p of .012 was done.</dc:description>
