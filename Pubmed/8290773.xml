<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Evaluation of ventricular septal defect with two-dimensional echocardiography and color flow Doppler. PATIENTS AND METHODS We had studied by this method 180 patients; 97 males and 83 (mean age 1.5 +/- 1 years) diagnosed of a VSD. Cases with a complex cardiopathy were excluded from the study. The VSD was classified according to its location and relation to the tricuspid anulus and semilunar valves in perimembranous VSD, muscular VSD and subarterial double committed defect. The colour Doppler identified one or two areas of low through the ventricular septum with a zona of proximal acceleration throughout systole. Every group can be evaluated in different views but they all have a selective echocardiographic view except for muscular trabecular VSD. RESULTS Seventy-six patients had perimembranous VSD (30 inlet, 26 trabecular and 20 infundibular-outlet), 102 had muscular VSD (3 inlet, 97 trabecular and 2 infundibular-outlet) and 2 had a subarterial double committed defect. A ventricular septal aneurysm was associated in 20 patients with muscular or perimembranous defects. Six patients, 2 of the perimembranous trabecular VSD, 2 muscular-trabecular VSD and 2 subarterial were initially misclassified. In this last 2 cases the turbulence created in the pulmonary valve was wrongly interpreted as pulmonary valvular stenosis; subcostal view for both tracts is necessary to avoid such mistake. In conclusion, color Doppler flow mapping is very useful to differentiate the various types as VSD and aids identification of multiples ventricular septal defects.</dc:description>
