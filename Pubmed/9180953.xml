<dc:description xml:lang="en">The colorectal neoplasia is the second cause of death from neoplasia in our country, and in international statistics, blaming for this, the dietetic habits of industrialized countries having a high content of satured fat, cholesterol, refined carbohydrate, red meat, and with few dietetic fibers. In the last years special attention has been focused to the action of the total biliar acids (TBA) primarily the secondary ones, over the colon mucosa, showing evidences of cancerous effects. Recently, American authors have published the favoring action of the cellulose fiber over the TBA through a catalytic reaction and their polysterification, inactivating them in their aggressive action over the colon mucosa. Through these experiences and willing to prove the action of the product, we have treated with microcrystalline cellulosa (Microcel Lab. Blanver, Brasil) 20 patients of the Institute of Gastroenterology of Havana City, who showed high figures of TBA in stools for 2 months, compared with the 5 g. dose per day. Another group of 20 patients also with high figures of TBA in stools being treated with corn fecula same dose, same time by equal time, making every month determinations to both groups, determining that in the first group the figures of TBA in stools were normalized in 95% the first month of treatment and in 100% the second month. The second group had only an answer of 65% the first month and of 80% the second month, which shows evidently the high efficacy of Microcel in reducing the TBA in stools.</dc:description>
