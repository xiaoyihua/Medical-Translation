<dc:description xml:lang="en">There is no clear explanation for the known fact that peripheral levels of T lymphocytes are decreased in alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis. Cellular immune deficiency in cirrhosis has been attributed to this phenomenon. In order to confirm this observation and clarify its cause, the different lymphocyte populations of the peripheral blood of 52 patients with alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis and of 30 control subjects were studied. Absolute lymphocyte counts were decreased in cirrhotic patients (p less than 0.05) due to a marked reduction of T lymphocytes (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, T lymphocytes and, to a lesser degree, B lymphocytes, but not the remaining lymphocyte populations (referred to as "other lymphocytes" in this study), were decreased in relation to the existence of portal hypertension. Thus, a significant reduction of T and B lymphocytes (p less than 0.001) exists in cirrhotics with portal hypertension with respect to those without portal hypertension. The sequestering action of the hypertrophic spleen in patients with portal hypertension could be responsible for this phenomenon.</dc:description>
