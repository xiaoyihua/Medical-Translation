<dc:description xml:lang="en">Glycemia and insulinemia in rat blood samples have been determined at different times before and after administration of glibenclamide, PGE1, glibenclamide and PGE1, glibenclamide and glucose, PGE1 and glucose, and glibenclamide, PGE1 and glucose. PGE1 led to a partial inhibition of glibenclamide induced insulin release, with and without glucose administration, but a total inhibition did not occur. The inhibitory action of PGE1 on insulin secretion was also reflected on the glycemia curves. Defects in insulin release in diabetes could be due in part to an excessive production of PGs, that involve a failure in the beta-cells to respond to glucose signals. The present paper shows that glibenclamide secretory action was not cancelled out by PGE1. These results could explain the availability of glibenclamide in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.</dc:description>
