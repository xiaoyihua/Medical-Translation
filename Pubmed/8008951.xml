<dc:description xml:lang="en">We wish to find out the quality of the diagnostic test commonly used in epidemiological studies to detect hypertension, and in so doing, we study the validity of epidemiological criteria in the detection of hypertension (diagnostic test) and compare the diagnostic thresholds of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint National Committee (JNC). Two methods of detection for arterial hypertension are used in this study of 674 people. One is population-based (mobile unit), and the other is opportunistic sampling. (systematic measurements of blood pressure in medical consultations). As a test of certainty, clinical confirmation is performed. The methodology of Haynes and Sackett is used in the validation study. The epidemiological criteria obtains a sensibility of 90.4 percent and a specificity of 94.4 percent with the diagnostic thresholds of WHO, and a sensibility of 97 percent and a specificity of 81.2 percent with those of JNC, which are defined as effective methods of screening in the detection of hypertension. The excess prevalence of HBP obtained using the diagnostic criteria of WHO is 4.5 percent (that is to say of 12.2 percent of the cases of hypertension found by the epidemiological criteria, that figure decreases to 7.7% percent with clinical confirmation). With the JNC criteria, it is 14.5 percent (from 34.1 percent, it goes to 19.6 percent). This excess can be used to adjust numbers found in epidemiological studies to their real values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
