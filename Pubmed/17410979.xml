<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To study the characteristics and evolution of the epidermoid penis tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS It was carried out a retrospective study on the epidermoid penis tumours treated in our center between 1981 and 2005. RESULTS 16 tumours penis epidermoides were diagnosed. The average age of the patients was of 71.7 years (interval between 54 and 90 years). In 80% of the cases they are diagnosed in advanced stadiums (T3 and T4). The most habitual presentation forms are the ulcerous lesions (53%) and papilar (33%). The average diameter of the lesion was 2.3 cm, and the most frequent localization the glands (53%) and balano prepucial (33%). They were carried out 7 local scissions, 8 partial penectomies, one total penectomy, and an local scission pluslocal treatment with 5-fluoracile. With a follow-up of 24 months 5 relapses took place, mainly in patients subjected to local excision of the lesion (p = 0.06 log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS The epidermoid carcinoma of the penis is a tumoral lesion characteristic of advanced ages that is diagnosed later and treated in not very aggressive way. Therefore it is frequent the advanced stadiums and the tumour relapses.</dc:description>
