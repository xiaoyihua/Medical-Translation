<dc:description xml:lang="en">For the nursing profession, the practice of minor surgery means the recovery of an activity which possesses a long historical tradition in our profession and an experience for nurses to provide a specific service in health care. The incorporation of minor surgery as one of the services offered by Primary Outpatient Clinic Care is taking place slowly but surely, especially in light of the advantages it provides. For several years now, some health professionals, nurses and doctors belonging to the Andalucian Health Services, have been actively working on the development and implementation of Minor Surgery Programs inside the Health Clinics of our community. One of our lines of work has been the development of protocols for the treatment of the most habitual lesions by means of minor surgery. Among these are cutaneous cysts whose protocol we present in this article.</dc:description>
