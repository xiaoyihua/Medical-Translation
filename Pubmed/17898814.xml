<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The health organisations have moved from being centred on the professionals and are now centred on users and their expectations. The new health institutions want to know patients' perception of the quality of the care received, with particular respect to the information received, consent and decision making. It is necessary to have available measuring instruments that explore the different components of the process of information, consent and decision making. BACKGROUND To identify the dimensions related to the process of information, consent and decision making of most importance to patients and susceptible to evaluation by questionnaire. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Adult persons who have been hospitalised for at least two days. Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. RESULTS The participants wish to be informed and to participate in decision making; they do not know the meaning of the charter of patients' rights; they wish to share the whole care process with their family; written information is incomprehensible to them; and they feel that their pain and discomfort do not receive appropriate attention. CONCLUSION It would be convenient to include the following dimensions in the questionnaires on satisfaction: a) the possibility of clarifying doubts; b) real knowledge of the rights and duties of patients; c) participation by the family in the care process; d) continuity of the same informer throughout hospitalisation; d) degree of understanding of the written information; e) involvement in decision making; and f) attention to pain and discomfort.</dc:description>
