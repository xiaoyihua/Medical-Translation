<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder, with frequent relapses and a poor prognosis. This study analyzes response to treatment and prognosis in a series of MCL patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD Retrospective study of MCL patients diagnosed in a single institution between 1996 and 2013. The cohort was divided according to the treatment received. RESULTS Forty-five patients were included (32 male) with a median age of 66 years old. Twenty-one received intensive chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy (based on high-dose cytarabine), 13 semi-intensive (without high-dose cytarabine), 8 not intensive and 3 did not require treatment. Overall response rate was 85% in the intensive and 77% in the semi-intensive treatment groups. In multivariate analysis, intensive treatment was correlated with a longer progression-free survival (hazard ratio 9.8 [95% CI 2.7-35.5], P=.001) and overall survival (4.5 [1.2-17.8], P=.03). CONCLUSIONS In this retrospective series of MCL patients, intensive treatment was correlated with better outcomes than the other treatment modalities.</dc:description>
