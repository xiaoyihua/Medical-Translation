<dc:description xml:lang="en">The practice of Medicine is exposed to everyday's ethical ventures that, even though not fundamental in a philosophical scope, are most crucial given its incidence and consequences to accessibility and equity in health care. A very special perception must emerge to allow us looking for those situations where moral conflicts are prone to raise, since they are usually involved in the gleam of modern medicine with all its scientific and technological cohort. Medicine is a social right; however is far from standing equally accessible to every one and a number of privileges are seen in its delivery. Being a person-to-person commitment it is usually dephased out of its objective and retained as a disease centered endeavour. Instrumentalization, superspecialization, inappropriate management of patients and problems, and overuse of technology, are some of the characteristic ethical transgressions addressed because of its overwhelming impact on health care costs and abusive patient-doctor relationship. A sound rectification of these aberrant conducts is mandatory to get a dignified renewal of medicine.</dc:description>
