<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cell-free homogenates of submandibular gland of 10 to 90 days old female rats, when injected in 90 days old female rats, previously treated with isoproterenol, produced a stimulatory or an inhibitory effect on the DNA synthesis. By filtration on Sephadex G-100 it was possible to separate protein or proteins presenting such an effects. The stimulatory effect was found in glands of 10 to 30 days old rats, while the inhibitory one was present in the 60 to 90 days old rats. It seems that there is a coincidence between the appearance of acinar cells and the presence of the inhibitory factor.</dc:description>
