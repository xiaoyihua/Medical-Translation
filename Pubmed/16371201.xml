<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Introduction and objectives. Intracoronary Doppler guidewire measurement provides information about the state of the myocardial microcirculation. Our aim was to assess the relationship between the pattern of coronary flow and myocardial viability. Patients and method. The study included 19 patients who had had a recent myocardial infarction (&lt; 1 month), who underwent percutaneous revascularization of the responsible vessel, and who agreed to angiographic follow-up. Patients were divided into two groups according to the extent of the akinetic area observed at follow-up responsible (149 [40] days) in the myocardial region supplied by the responsible artery: one group (n=11) had preserved regional contractility (i.e., an akinetic area less than 30%); the other group (n=8) had impaired regional contractility (i.e., an akinetic area equal to or greater than 30%). Coronary flow in the artery was responsible assessed after revascularization and at follow-up using the Doppler guidewire method. RESULTS After revascularization, patients with preserved regional contractility had a higher diastolic deceleration half-time than those with impaired regional contractility (628 [188] ms vs 376 [131] ms, P=.02). At follow-up, the difference in coronary flow between the groups had disappeared. Patients in whom regional contractility was preserved demonstrated a significant increase in coronary flow reserve at follow-up (1,8 [0,5] vs 2,3 [0,5], P=.01). CONCLUSIONS After timely revascularization (within one month) of the vessel responsible for a myocardial infarction, the pattern of coronary flow observed in patients with viable myocardium differed from that in those with non-viable myocardium. The differences disappeared during follow-up.</dc:description>
