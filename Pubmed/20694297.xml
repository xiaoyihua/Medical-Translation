<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To compare the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects of two enteral feeding formulas with changes in the origin of protein (casein and isolated soy protein) in hospitalised elderly patients. METHOD A cross sectional survey was done among a sample of elderly patients carrying nasogastric tube admitted to the Reina Sofia General Hospital (Murcia) during a period of 6 months. A formula based on casein or soybean protein was randomly assigned. The variables studied were: age, sex, cause for indication of EN, duration of the EN and maximum amount of EN administered per day. Nutritional status at admission and discharge, mortality and gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhoea, constipation, vomits or regurgitation) were also collected. Statistical analyses were performed with the Student's T and chi 2 tests, with a significance of 95%. RESULTS Sample conformed by 50 patients over 65 years (48% casein, 52% soybean) without statistically significant differences in age nor cause of indication of the EN. Either there were no differences in the nutritional status at the admission and discharge in both groups. Significant differences were observed in the incidence of diarrhoea (C: 45.83%, S: 7.69%, p = 0.009) and vomits (C: 41.66%, S: 15.38%, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS A significant reduction in the incidence of gastrointestinal complications, a reduction in the incidence of ulcers by pressure and less mortality occurred on the group that took formula based on the soybean protein. The individualized nutritional evaluation must be performed routinely when the patient is admitted to the hospital for detection and treatment of early signs of malnutrition.</dc:description>
