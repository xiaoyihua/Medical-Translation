<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Surgery and anesthetic method have immunomodulating effects on hemodynamic response and stress. We compared the effects of 2 intraoperative analgesic regimens on patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a randomized double-blind trial in ASA 1 and 2 patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy under balanced anesthesia. Twenty-nine patients were randomized to 2 groups. One group received analgesia by infusion of remifentanil plus morphine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as rescue medications; the other received conventional analgesia with bolus doses of fentanyl according to changes in hemodynamic variables. We measured levels of proinflammatory (interleukin [IL]-6) and antiinflammatory (IL-10) cytokines, cortisol, and C-reactive protein preoperatively, at incision, and at 1, 4 and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of the markers studied at baseline. In each group, however, there were significant changes from baseline at the various points in time. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were significantly elevated (P &lt; .05) at 4 hours. The changes in cortisol levels were significantly different at 1 and 4 hours. Finally, there were significant increases in C-reactive protein at 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS Unlike other clinical trials, our study detected no differences between the 2 techniques in response to surgical stress evaluated by analyzing concentrations of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, cortisol, and C-reactive protein.</dc:description>
