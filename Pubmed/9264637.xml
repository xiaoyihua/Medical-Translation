<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To verify the influence of the weather on suicides. DESIGN A retrospective descriptive study. SETTING County of Cartagena. PARTICIPANTS All the suicides recorded in the Anatomical Forensic Institute of Cartagena between 1986 and 1993. INTERVENTIONS Creation of a data base with the essential features of each suicide and all the relevant bioclimatological variables of the exact moment they happen. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A statistical description of each variable was made. The relationship between the different variables was defined by the Pearson chi 2 test and residual analysis. The sample data were compared with the population data (Neyman-Pearson and Pearson chi 2 tests), p &lt; 0.05. 149 suicides were recorded. These suicides occur during the day, Monday and Saturday being the days with the highest number of them. Distribution throughout the month was homogeneous: July was the month with most suicides. There was an age band in the second and third decades of life and a peak in elderly people. Our sample had 77.9% men. Retired people and housewives predominated. CONCLUSION Suicides are generally influenced by meteorological factors.</dc:description>
