<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The clinical profile of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who have reinfarction (REAMI) during their stay in the intensive cardiologic care unit (ICCU) is not well known. The aim of this study was to identify factors predictive of REAMI, as well as its global incidence and mortality. PATIENTS AND METHOD All patients with AMI admitted to the ICCU of 17 hospitals in the Comunidad de Valencia (Spain) in the period 1995-2000 (PRIMVAC Registry) were included. Differential characteristics between patients with or without REAMI were determined, and odds ratios (OR) for possible predictive factors were estimated with their 95% confidence intervals by logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 12,071 patients were included. Mean age of the patients was of 65.5 years, the percentage of women was 23.8%, and the incidence of REAMI was 2.8%. The REAMI group was significantly older than the non-REAMI group. Female sex was significantly more common in the REAMI group. More diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were carried out, more drugs were used and there were more complications in the REAMI group. Mortality was significantly higher in the REAMI group (37.8% vs 12.6%). Only age, diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction and the appearance of Q waves in the electrocardiogram were independently associated with the presence of REAMI. CONCLUSIONS REAMI in the ICCU was associated with high mortality. Some clinical factors present during the first few hours after AMI were associated independently with the appearance of REAMI.</dc:description>
