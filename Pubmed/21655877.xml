<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Epicardial fat has been associated to the presence of significant coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the association of lipomatous infiltration of the atrial septum and fat infiltration of the right ventricle remains uncertain. None of these parameters has been thoroughly studied in Hispanic patients. OBJECTIVE To determine the association between epicardial fat, lipomatous infiltration of the atrial septum and fat infiltration of the right ventricle with the presence of CAD. METHODS Two hundred and fifty Hispanic patients (86 women and 164 men, mean age 61.5 ± 8 vs 62 ± 10 respectively), undergoing their first invasive coronary angiography (ICA) were studied. The day after the ICA, parameters of cardiac fat deposition were evaluated using 2D-echocardiography. Clinical (age, sex, personal antecedents of smoking habit, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, as well as clinical presentation of CAD) and anthropometric (waist circumference and body mass index [BMI]) variables were also collected. RESULTS Epicardial fat (OR 1.27 p = 0.009), as well as fat infiltration of the right ventricle (OR 2.94 p = 0.027), had a significant and independent association with the presence, but not the extent (p = 0.516) and clinical presentation (p = 0.153) of CAD. The extent of epicardial fat deposition showed a proportional and significant association (p = 0.001) with the presence of CAD. CONCLUSION Epicardial fat and fat infiltration of the right ventricle were both significant and independent factors associated to the presence of CAD, which was proportionally increased according to the extent of cardiac fat deposition.</dc:description>
