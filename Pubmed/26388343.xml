<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Due to the lack of evidence, the objective was to show the inequalities in mortality by educational level in Navarra and the contribution of the main causes of death to the magnitude of inequalities in mortality from all causes of death. METHODS All citizens aged 25 years and older residing in Spain in 2001 were followed during 7 years to determine their vital status. Level of education was used as socioeconomic status indicator. It was estimated the age-adjusted total mortality rate and mortality rate from cause-specific mortality by educational level. Then it was calculated the relative difference (ratio) and the absolute difference in rates between the lowest and highest levels of education and the contribution of the main causes of death to the absolute difference. RESULTS The rate ratio for all causes of death was 1.37 in men and 1.23 in women. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (25.84) and unintentional injuries (3.78) are the causes of death with higher rate ratio in men and diabetes (4.92) and HIV (4.38) in women. Cardiovascular diseases were the leading causes of death that contribute most to the absolute difference in mortality: 26% in men and 48% women. CONCLUSIONS The mortality rate in the Navarre population shows an inverse gradient with educational level, except in some cancer sites. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death that contributes most to the absolute inequalities in mortality, while other causes of death that show significant relative inequalities, contribute little to the absolute inequalities.</dc:description>
