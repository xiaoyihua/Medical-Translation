<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Currently there is a need for specific training and special dedication to pediatric urology (PU). Nevertheless, we lack of a continuous education program, which must be specific and multidisciplinary. OBJECTIVES To create a complementary training program in PU with the following differential characteristics: 1) University postgraduate, 2) internationally accredited, 3) multidisciplinary, 4) theoretical and practical, 5) through virtual teaching, 6) with on-site support, 7) academically directed and mentored, 8) based on individual and group self learning, 9) with international faculty and alumni 10) objectively evaluable. METHODS We developed two original projects of virtual training courses with practices in PU, Master and Expert following the International University of Andalucía (UNIA) regulations and with the support of the Medical College of Malaga. The Master has a general content one year duration and will be repeated yearly. The Expert course has monographic character, half-year duration and will be repeated yearly with different topics. They are credited 60 and 30 ECTS credits respectively. The course has 3 parts well differentiated in objectives and development: 1. Virtual training 2. On-site hospital practices and, 3. Final work. The alumni answered a questionnaire to evaluate the master at the midpoint. RESULTS The UNIA has considered viable and approved all 3 projects presented: I PU MASTER (2014-2015), II PU MASTER (2015-2016) and Expert Course on pediatric incontinence (2015-2016)First PU MASTER data.- Registration applications: 60 alumni. Admitted alumni 40; mean age 37 years; 8 nationalities, 57% Spanish, 43% Foreigners. Specialities: Urology 14(35%), Pediatric Surgery 24 (60%), Pediatrics (Pediatric nephrology 1), General Medicine 1. Mid term Master evaluation by the alumni (0-100). Difficulty 60. Quality of the topics 92; complementary materials 90; faculty 90; UNIA virtual Campus 89. CONCLUSIONS The demand of registrations demonstrates the need and interest of a pediatric Urology training program, through Master and Expert Courses. Virtual Training, e-learning, within the Virtual Campus of the UNIA is viable. This self-learning model is being highly valued by the international alumni. We offer an interesting supplement for continuous education in PU.</dc:description>
