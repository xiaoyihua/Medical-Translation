<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cluster condyloma is currently one of the sexually transmitted diseases of higher incidence. The most common sites for condyloma in males are the balanopreputial sulcus, frenulum and the glans' mucosa. Associated to penis condyloma there can be urethral lesions in 5% of patients which in 80% of cases develop less than 3 cm from the meatus. This paper presents a series of 14 cases of cluster intraurethral condyloma managed by transurethral electrofulguration. The technique consists in the introduction of a coagulation probe through the urethrotome and the application of electrofulguration to the condyloma base. Results have been satisfactory although relapse has occurred in 2 cases (14%), and in one of them the procedure had to be repeated up to 3 times. There has been no complications such as stenosis in the loop resections. The authors conclude that due to the difficulties in the medical management of these lesions, the use of invasive techniques, of which transurethral electrofulguration of the condyloma base with endoscopic urethrotome is the choice because of its simplicity and effectiveness, is justified.</dc:description>
