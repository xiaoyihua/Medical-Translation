<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Previous studies have provided evidence of the existence of differences in preoperative assessment practices and have questioned the usefulness of generalized testing for all patients. The objective of this study was to determine the attitudes and opinions of anesthesiologists and surgeons about their application of preoperative assessment procedures and their knowledge of the scientific principles underlying their practice. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A questionnaire was mailed to 227 specialists in anesthesiology and postoperative intensive care, general and gastrointestinal surgery, orthopedic surgery and traumatology of all hospitals in Catalonia (Spain) with active operating theaters. RESULTS The overall response rate was 61% of the surveyed population, with 86% of the Catalan hospitals represented. The medical literature supports the routine performance of a chest x-ray and an ECG in the opinion of 17 and 26% of the respondents, respectively. Those two procedures are always ordered by 43 and 37%, respectively, even if they believe that the medical literature does not support generalized application. Legal protection was given as the reason for routine ordering of preoperative tests in asymptomatic patients, and 89% believed that a protocol for selective preoperative assessment procedures would improve efficiency. CONCLUSIONS This study reveals a discrepancy between the opinions of professionals involved in preoperative assessment and their real practice in Catalan hospitals, probably influenced by perceived need for legal protection.</dc:description>
