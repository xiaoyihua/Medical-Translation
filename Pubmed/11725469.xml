<dc:description xml:lang="en">Chronic hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) is a disabling complication of chronic liver failure and porto-systemic shunt. The pathogenesis of CHE remains unclear but increased levels of ammonia are a basic feature. Several clinical and experimental observations support a role for manganese (Mn) in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Increased blood levels of Mn have been described in patients with CHE and this could lead to its accumulation on the basal ganglia and characteristic hyperintensities of basal ganglia as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. We report on the clinical features and characteristic radiologic findings of a patient who presented with the neurologic syndrome of CHE and who had very high blood levels of Mn in the absence of an occupational exposure to this metal. Our report supports the hypothesis that Mn has a role in the pathogenesis of CHE and also suggests that brain MRI is a useful marker of the brain metabolic repercussion due to CHE.</dc:description>
