<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common disease and may be due to psychological or organic causes. It might point to a silent disease and its value could not only be in life quality but also directly resolving the health problem laying beneath. The evaluation of ED begins with sexual records and physical examination which have been reported to have a 95 percent sensitivity, and a 50 percent specificity. Additional diagnostic tests are needed to maximize specificity. Sexual impairment in general Internal Medicine patients has not been sufficiently studied yet. PATIENTS AND METHODS Unselected ambulatory and hospital admitted patients were interviewed during 2003 using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) ad the Sexual Health Interview for Men (SHIM). The cut-off point was 21. RESULTS A total of 51 male patients were interviewed, middle age was 65 years old (30-88). Of these, 27 denied sexual activity (group I). Middle age in this group was 64 years old. In the 24 patients with sexual activity (group II) middle age was 61 years old. The IIEF score was less than 45 in 11 patients (groups I and II of erectile dysfunction) The SHIM middle score was 26 points. The score was &lt; 21 in 10 patients (41.6%). Concordance between both test was 90.9%. Risk factors included: tobacco (12 patients), alcohol (9), hypertension (8), and diabetes (7) among others. CONCLUSION Our investigation seems to show that a great number of patients attended by Internists have sexual impairment (41.6%). None of these were under specific therapy nor consulted for this disease. Middle age is lower among patients with sexual activity as compared with the group without sexual activity. This assessment should be included in the medical interview with the aim of prescribing specific therapy to improve patient's quality of life.</dc:description>
