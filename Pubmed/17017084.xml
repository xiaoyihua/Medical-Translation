<dc:description xml:lang="en">The history and evolution of the bioprostheses is revised, above all the stentless. According to the international literature these were the first prosthesis that were established to cardiac level with very good results in the haemodynamic aspect, but that to lack an adequate preparation to diminish its antigenicity, to enlarge its resistance and to avoid the deterioration by calcification, less lasting than the mechanics did them. Nevertheless, it given that the real valvular area is much better than in all the other prostheses, their magnificent haemodynamic performance, the not mandatory use of anticoagulants, they do it a good offering for the patients with valvulopathy, above all the aortic. That international experience, now also shows how the use of anticalcification has improved even more the performance of these prostheses, to enlarge considerably its useful time of long-term life, reasons these by that are being utilized in form increasingly more extensive, above all indicating its use in patients more young, which before was almost prohibitive. Finally the initial experience with these bioprotheses in the National Institute of Cardiology of México is mentioned.</dc:description>
