<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Elastofibroma dorsi has been described in the literature as an unusual tumor or pseudotumor. However, autopsies and imaging studies have revealed that it is a non-negligible finding. PURPOSE The aim of this study has been to illustrate and become familiar with this type of lesion in order to prevent misdiagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS From 3 December 2008 to 5 January 2010, 1,751 patients were evaluated with (18)FDG-PET/CT. Of these, 29 cases of elastofibroma dorsi were recorded as an incidental finding. A retrospective and descriptive analysis was performed on this study series. RESULTS The study showed a prevalence of 1.66%. Out of the 29 findings, 22 (75.86%) were females and 7 (24.14%) males. Seventeen (58.62%) cases were bilateral, 12 (41.38%) unilateral and the SUVmax ranged from 1.4 to 3.2. These lesions were reported as soft tissue density images with mild or moderate diffuse metabolic activity. CONCLUSION The elastofibroma dorsi is a relatively common finding in PET/CT that should be known in order to avoid making wrong diagnoses.</dc:description>
