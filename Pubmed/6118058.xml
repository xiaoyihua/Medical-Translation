<dc:description xml:lang="en">The bronchodilator effects of PGE-2, isolated by semisynthetic procedures from the plexaura homomalla of the insular platform of the Cuban archipelago, was studied. Fifty bronchial asthma patients were evaluated by spirometry, before and after inhalation of an aerosol of PGE-2, in alcohol solution. The patients were divided into 4 groups, each group being tested spirometically at different moments before and after aerosol administration. The results obtained within each group were compared. Systemic blood pressure (T.A.) and heart rate (F.C.C.) were recorded simultaneously in order to detect any secondary effects on the cardiovascular system. In parallel with this study, asthmatic patients were divided into 2 control group with whom the same study was done using a different aerosol composition. In one group, a placebo of ethyl alcohol was administered, in the same proportion as the PGE-2 would have been. In the other, the aerosol contained isoproterenol and ethyl alcohol. These tests were planned to determine the significance of the initiating effect of the alcohol. The significance of the difference in the results obtained was determined statistically in all cases. Finally, the PGE-2 aerosol was used by asthmatics during acute crises, with similar methodology. Results indicated that the product tested has initiating effects on the respiratory tract mucosa, lacks a significant bronchodilating capacity and has no secondary effects on the cardiovascular system.</dc:description>
