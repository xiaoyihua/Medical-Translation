<dc:description xml:lang="en">During the last 3 years the National Academy of Medicine, the School of Medicine and the Ministry of Health have analyzed several global health issues with local impact. The group of articles presented in this symposium is focused on the health systems. The Mexican health system has evolved through the years facing different challenges and showing its strengths as well as several inconsistencies, flaws and limitations. The subjects analyzed deal with several alternatives to face the health challenges. All health systems are under constant change and financial resources as well as conceptual clarity, human resources, coordination, and leadership are needed.</dc:description>
