<dc:description xml:lang="en">Extragonadal teratomas are more frequent in the mediastinum and sacrococcygeal region. In this work, two cases of mature mediastinal teratoma, that simulated infection processes are reported. These cases appeared during the last semester of the year 2000 and represent the casuistry of the University Hospital of The Andes (IAHULA) between 1996 and 2005. Two patients, one ten-year-old and the other eight-month-old were admitted at the hospital with a diagnosis of bronchopneumonia and pulmonary abscess with clinical manifestations of cough, dyspnea and chest pain. During surgery, a multicystic tumor composed of fat, sebaceous and mucinous materials, hair, mineralized elements and blood was found in both cases. A histological examination revealed the presence of neoplastic cells derived from more than one germinal strata. Teratomas are infrequent, but the diagnosis must be considered in children with respiratory symptoms. A full histological examination was required to reach a definitive diagnosis. The histological diagnosis was easily performed by conventional light microscopic examination. No additional techniques were necessary. Surgical resection should thus be the first choice for treatment. Four years later, there is no evidence of tumor recurrence.</dc:description>
