<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE It is necessary to deepen in the knowledge of the Basic Minimum Set of Data (CMBD-RSS) of patients with chronic pathology associated and frequent hospitalisations (the subacute care). The aim of this study was to analyse the sanitary information of these patients, once initiated the subacute program. METHODS We used data of 660 patients hospitalised in the subacute care unit at the Santa Caterina Hospital, sanitary region of Girona, from October 2013 to December 2014. The CMBD data base was analysed using SPSS Statistics 15.0. We verified the relationship between variables i.e. length of stay and age; origin of the patient admission and length of stay (Mann-Whitney U Test); main diagnosis and length of stay (Kruskal-Wallis). We also studied the relationship between origin of the patient admission and main diagnosis (Chi-square test and Cramer's V). RESULTS The average age of patients was 83 years old, and mainly female profile (55%). Five illnesses concentrated 80% of all patients' diagnosed diseases (mental health problems, nervous system diseases, circulatory problems, respiratory system problems and genitourinary infections). Patients admitted from hospitals had a shorter length of stay (8 days) than patients admitted from home (9 days). 80% of cases patients come back home after the hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS People with chronic pathology associated and frequent hospitalisations are an important group of risk. Elderly and clinical decompensations add complexity to these cases. The evaluation of these patients at the admission and discharge procedures optimise the use of the resources.</dc:description>
