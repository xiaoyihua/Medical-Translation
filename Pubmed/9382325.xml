<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine the usefulness of magnetic resonance in the diagnosis and follow-up in congenital heart disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 1992 and 1994, we have evaluated 250 patients (between 1 day-22 years of age) with congenital heart disease. We used a Philips-Gyroscan 0.5 Tesla set-up and the studies were made with ECG-gated multislice sequences with the time of repetition adapted to the cardiac frequency. The slice thicknesses were 3-10 mm and the field of view was 100-400 mm. Three axes were used: axial, oblique coronal and 30-60 degrees oblique sagittal. Three groups were made: A) Patients in whom MR imaging was the elected technique for establishment of the diagnosis; B) Patients were MR imaging was an alternative technique; and C) Patients were MR imaging was complementary to other techniques. All patients underwent a Doppler echocardiographic study or an angiocardiogram. RESULTS Group A) One hundred and fifty-one patients were included with the following conditions: Eighty-two with coarctation of the aorta or aortic arch interruption, 12 with vascular ring, 5 with truncus arteriosus in order to evaluate the pulmonary branches, 28 cases operated for Fallot or transposition of the great vessels for the evaluation of the pulmonary branches, 16 with single ventricle for the evaluation of the bulboventricular foramen, 5 with complex congenital heart disease and 3 with pericardial agenesia-herniation. Group B) Sixty-five patients were included in this group with the following diagnoses: Ten with aorto-pulmonary colateral arteries, 13 with anomalous pulmonary drainage of the systemic veins, 38 with tronco-conal anomalies and 4 with supravalvular aortic stenosis. Group C) Thirty-four patients with the following conditions were included in this group: Ten with common atrioventricular septal defects, 6 with tricuspid atresia, 6 with atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordance and 12 with other anomalies. CONCLUSIONS MR imaging can replace other techniques in the diagnosis and follow-up of some congenital heart diseases and in a non-invasive way.</dc:description>
