<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study was conducted to evaluate usefulness of the physiologic stability index (PSI) in a pediatric intensive care Unit (PICU) of a University based hospital at Santiago, Chile. Subjects include all patients (n = 152) consecutively admitted to our PICU between april 1987 and august 1988. The PSI system was applied during the first four days from admission. The age of the patients ranged from 10 days to 15 years. Scores obtained from survivors and non survivors were compared using an analysis of variance. For maximum PSI, survivors had significantly lower scores (9.39 points) that non survivors (21.71 points). Multiple logistic regression was used to display associations between mean obtained scores and probability of death and a curve was plotted which is similar to that obtained in previous experiences from other countries.</dc:description>
