<dc:description xml:lang="en">From March, 1987 to July 1990, 1,568 surgical procedures, were done at Oncological Gynecology Service; 206 of them (13.1%) were considered as "non-gynecological" surgical procedures; 182 (88.3%) were secondary to a malignity diagnosis, being the most frequent one ovarian carcinoma (54.4%). As to benign lesions, 11.7% caused "non gynecological" surgery, most frequent were severe pelvic adhesions, 41.6%, and severe endometriosis, 25%. "Non-gynecological" surgical procedure carried out most frequently was pelvic lymphadenectomy. Morbidity was 3.8%, and mortality, 0.48% due to acute myocardial infarction. The acceptance for oncologic gynecologist is justified in this series, based on survival and morbi-mortality, which permits the participation in a multidisciplinary team.</dc:description>
