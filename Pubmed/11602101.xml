<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To describe cardiovascular morbidity of a hypertensive patients cohort and relate it to the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), LVH geometric patterns, other cardiovascular risk factors (CRF), previous pathology (PP) and a range of variables. DESIGN Prospective study of the cohort visited in a from 1993 to 1998. Place. Downtown primary care center. PATIENTS A random sample of 267 hypertensive patients under 80 years old was used. Method and procedures. The presence of universals of CRF, PP and a range of variables such as age, sex, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), heart rate, body mass index (BMI), left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and Cornell and Sokolov-Lyon electrocardiographic criteria were registered. Also cardiovascular events (CE) were recorded: heart failure (HF), coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, arrythmia and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Then the association between these variaables and CE appearance was studied. MEASURES AND RESULTS The total amount of CE was 60, with an accumulated incidence of 22.5% (confidence interval 95% from 19.4 to 25.7%).HF was more frequent among patients with a higher BMI (p = 0.05). The patients with HF showed a stronger smoking habit as CRF and a higher PAS (p = 0.05). The PVD was more common among hypertensive patients with smoking habit as CRF (p = 0.05).EC was highly observed in those patients either with LVH or CRF, especially in those cases such as HF (90% had LVH), stroke (87.5%) and arrythmias (83.3%). However, it was less observed in those ones with PVD (66.7%) and HF (60%). No relation was found between the patterns of LVH and EC. CONCLUSIONS The HF was more frequent among the hypertensive patients with a higher LVMI, the HF among the smokers and a higher PAS and PVD among the smokers. The LVH is strongly related to the HF, stroke and arrythmias. The differences among the populations with cardiovascular epidemiology as well as the short span of follow-up may have contributed to obtaining such results.</dc:description>
