<dc:description xml:lang="en">Case crossover studies are considered as a variant of case control studies, and they have been included in the scientific literature since approximately eighteen years ago. They have also been used in epidemiological research on acute or intermittent exposures that may lead to a number of events including heart attack or cardiac arrest, injuries, asthma, etc. Application of this particular study design requires defining concepts such as: triggers, induction time, case period and control period. Its use is limited in studies on chronic exposures. On the other hand, this type of design may reduce selection and misclassification bias, confounding, and overmatching. Another advantage is that it requires a small sample size because the same case can be used as its own control in one or several periods. Nevertheless, sample size calculation must be assessed as a matched case-control study. This is a type of study in which theoretical principles are accomplished in a sui generis manner.</dc:description>
