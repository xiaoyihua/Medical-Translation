<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE This study was aimed at determining anti-human T-lymphotropic virus I/II (HTLV I/II) seroprevalence amongst blood-donors at the Clínica Reina Sofía in Bogotá, Colombia between 1999 and 2004. METHODS All people donating blood at the Clínica Reina Sofía were selected for anti-HTLV I/II testing; a survey was carried out which focused on risk factors. All blood donations were screened by using enzyme immunolinked assay (ELISA); repeatedly reactive serum samples were confirmed as being HTLV I or HTLV II by using Western blot (WB). RESULTS 8,913 blood donors, 5,883 (66 %) males and 3,030 (34 %) females having a mean age of 37 were included in the study; 26 (0,3 %) were repeatedly reactive in ELISA tests, 6 (0,07 %) of whom were confirmed by using Western blot (WB). Our findings revealed 0,07 % HTLV seroprevalence amongst blood-donors, in line with other European and South-American countries. CONCLUSION Although our findings suggest low HTLV I/II seroprevalence, blood-donors should be routinely screened to minimise transmission due to occult HTLV I/II infection in Colombia.</dc:description>
