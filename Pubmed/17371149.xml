<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hereditary activated protein C resistance (aPCR) has been identified as an important risk factor for the occurrence of thromboembolic events. It is most frequently hereditary, and caused by a point mutation in factor V, named Factor V Leiden (FVL), which renders it resistant to the anticoagulant action of circulating protein C. However, aPCR can also be found in absence of FVL (acquired aPCR), associated to lupus anticoagulant, pregnancy or neoplasms. We report a case of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in a 54 year-old woman, with no digestive symptoms and negative screening for biochemical tumor markers, who presented with DVT from FVL-negative aPCR, one year before being diagnosed of colonic adenocarcinoma. Once complete remission of the carcinoma was reached, aPCR returned to normal values. In thrombophilia screening studies, the finding of aPCR may be caused by acute-phase reactants or neoplastic processes, and therefore require evolutive evaluation and genetic search for FVL.</dc:description>
