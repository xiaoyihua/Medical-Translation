<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Although the possibility of developing cervical node metastases (CNM) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx (SCCL) depends on the site of tumor origin, other factors may be associated, even in glottic tumors. The objective of this study was to determine factors associated with CNM. METHODS We carried out a retrospective analysis of a series of patients with SCCL. We analyzed the following variables: T-staging, tumor site, and arytenoid-mobility/fixation. and correlated them with histopathological node status. Statistical significance was assessed using chi2 tests. RESULTS 91 patients were included 82 were male and 9 female; median age was 66 years. The most frequently affected site was the glottic-subglottic region (38) followed by the glottis (22). The most frequent T stage was T3 (46%) followed by T4 (25%); 81% were NO and 19% N+. 76 (83%) had arytenoid fixation. Factors associated with CNM included glottic-supraglottic infiltration (65%) and arytenoid fixation (17% vs. 0, p = 0.048). None of the patients with arytenoid mobility had CNM. Tumor infiltration to thyroid gland was observed among 14% of patients studied The most important risk factor was subglottic extension (17%; p = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS Lack of mobility of the arytenoid cartilage is a factor associated with CNM among SCCL patients. A subglottic tumor is a risk factor for thyroid infiltration</dc:description>
