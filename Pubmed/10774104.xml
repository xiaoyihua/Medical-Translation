<dc:description xml:lang="en">A total of 58 women with severe preeclampsia between 28-33 weeks of gestation were studied during the period from 1 October 1996 to 1 October 1997. Twenty-four women (42%) developed maternal or fetal indications necessitating early delivery within 48 hours, meanwhile the other 34 patients (58%) received expectant management. The average pregnancy prolongation period in the conservative management group was 6.4 days (range 3 to 18). The primary indications for delivery in this group were maternal indications 16 (47%), fetal compromise 13 (39%), 34 weeks of gestation 3 (8%), abruption placentae 1 (3%) and preterm labor 1 (3%). The mean birth weight and Apgar score at 5 minutes were 1520 +/- 310 g and 8, respectively. Expectant management was not associated with fetal death or maternal complications. The only neonatal death was related with sepsis and prematurity. The women in the early delivery group totaled two stillbirths and three neonatal deaths.</dc:description>
