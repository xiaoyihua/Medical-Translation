<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Seroepidemiologic studies carried out in different countries show that the prevalence of markers for infection by hepatitis A (HVA) is progressively decreasing in relation with improvement in the level of health care. The prevalence of anti-HVA in Catalunya and the factors related with infection by HVA were studied in order to obtain bases for designing prevention strategies adequate for the epidemiology of this infection. METHODS Anti-HVA was determined by a method of enzyme immunoassay in a randomized sample of the general population in Catalunya. Investigation of the influence of socio/demographic variables in the prevalence of HVA infection was carried out. RESULTS The global prevalence of anti-HVA was of 36%. In the population from 6 to 14 years of age it was of 13% and that of those over the age of 15 it was 86%. The prevalence of anti-HVA increases with age and is related with the social level of the families, the level of education and the place of birth. The incidence was higher in children of the lowest social class, in adults with the least education and in those born outside Catalunya. These factors constituted independent risk factors of HVA infection. CONCLUSIONS The present study confirms the association between HVA infection and socio-economic factors and demonstrates that the infection is not commonly found in infancy, an increase in the number of susceptible adults is foreseeable.</dc:description>
