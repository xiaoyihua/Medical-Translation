<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to evaluate the perception of mothers on the care given to their hospitalized children, a survey was specially designed and carried out with 100 mothers on the day of their child's discharge. Hospital care was rated excellent or good by a 96%, regular or bad by 4% of surveyed mothers. Most (74%) mothers saw at least one member of the caring team acting affectionately with their children; only 2% complained that her child was reprimanded or punished. Lack of equipment or human resources and comfort facilities were frequently perceived by mothers but quality of care was generally considered to be satisfactory. This kind of studies is probably useful to improve community's health services.</dc:description>
