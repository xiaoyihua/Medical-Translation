<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE There is no consensus on the treatment of chronic low back pain of disc origin in the medical literature. The few prospective, randomized, controlled studies evaluating the effectiveness of caudal epidural steroid injections (CESI) have obtained contradictory results. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of CEI in reducing pain and improving the associated disability. MATERIAL AND METHOD This is a prospective, randomized, case-control study of a group of 46 patients with chronic low back disc pain. Patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups to either receive fluoroscopy guided CESI (CESI-group), or oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID-group). All patients were clinically evaluated at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, and according to the indications of the Spanish Society for Study of Diseases of the Spine (GEER). RESULTS Lumbar pain, measured by the visual analog scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (ODQ), did not improve significantly during follow-up in any of the two study groups (P&gt;.05). Younger patients, women, patients with shorter duration of symptoms, low physical job demand, without leg pain, and sport-active, included in CESI-group showed a trend towards better results, but none reached statistical significance (P&gt;.05). CONCLUSIONS The present study has not demonstrated the superiority of CESI over NSAIDs in treating chronic low back pain of disc origin. While CESI could show some improvement in patients with degenerative lumbar disc disease, we consider it should be used with caution, informing patients about realistic expectations on the success of treatment.</dc:description>
