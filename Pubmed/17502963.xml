<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Neiva (a southern Colombia city) is endemic for dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever. Neiva has suffered outbreaks of dengue, that in 2004 being the latest one. This study was designed to characterise epidemiological and clinical data from that outbreak of dengue. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a descriptive, retrospective study of children aged less than 13 years who were admitted to the University Hospital and fulfilled the WHO's clinical and laboratory criteria for dengue or dengue haemorrhagic fever. Demographic, clinical and paraclinical data were recorded and analysed using Chi square (chi(2)) bivariate tabular test. RESULTS 105 children were diagnosed as suffering from either dengue haemorrhagic fever (87.6%) or dengue fever (12.4%); 67% of them were aged less than 5 years. Girls were more frequently affected by severe clinical manifestations. 83% of the children were admitted during the first six days of the disease; dengue shock syndrome was diagnosed in 20% and 76% presented clinical complications (chi(2) 29.53, gl 6, p=0.0000). Aminotransferases were 3 to 5 times above normal levels. There was a statistical correlation between low platelet count (less than 20 000 per mm(3)) and shock during admission (chi(2) 20.65, gl 4, p=0.0004). Complications arose during clinical evolution in 32% of the cases (13% myocarditis, 19% hepatitis or encephalitis and 2% sepsis). CONCLUSION The clinical and epidemiological characteristics observed in this cohort evidenced differences in age, gender and organs affected compared to data described in the literature; there was a high incidence of myocarditis.</dc:description>
