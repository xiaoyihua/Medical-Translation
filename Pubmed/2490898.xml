<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper deals with the incorporation of bean flour (Phaseolus vulgaris, var. Tórtola) (BF) made at laboratory scale in bread enrichment, by substituting 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% wheat flour by bean flour. First, wheat and bean flours blends were prepared to study the farinological properties of these combinations. Then, breads containing bean flour in the above-mentioned proportions were made. At the 6, 8 and 10% levels, a deterioration in farinological properties of the blends, such as water absorption, developing time, weakening and W value were evident. Baking tests showed that no significant changes occurred with respect to water absorption, mixing time, weight and volume of breads, and color and texture of crumb in BF levels of 2, 4 and 6%. However, overall qualities of the breads were significantly impaired at the 8 and 10% levels.</dc:description>
