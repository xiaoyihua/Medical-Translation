<dc:description xml:lang="en">The author starts with a definition of continuing education as a system of educational activities organized with some continuity over extended periods and directed at in-service health personnel for the chief purpose of complementing their initial training and thereby improving or extending health coverage. This definition encompasses all categories of health personnel. It is noted that education today faces two challenges: attainment of the goals of health for all by the year 2000 through the strategies of primary care, and the revolution in information technology. Continuing education is a possible response from the education field. It is stated, however, that in many cases the socioeconomic and health systems of countries hamper the development of continuing education programs.</dc:description>
