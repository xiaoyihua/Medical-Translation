<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Nosocomial bloodstream infections occur frequently in Neonatal Intensive Care Units and are associated with recognized and unrecognized risk factors. Little has been published regarding risk factors for bloodstream infections in low birth weight neonates. OBJECTIVE To investigate risk factors for bloodstream infection in neonates &lt; 1,500 g admitted at a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. METHODS A prospective study was undertaken in low birth weight neonates (&lt; 1,500g) during a 22 months period. Bivariant, and logistic regresion (stepwise procedure) analysis was used to determine the significance association of bloodstream infection and perinatal and nosocomial risk factors. RESULTS A total of 72 patiens with nosocomial bacteriemia and 147 non bacteriemic patients were studied. Independent risk factors associated with bloodstream infection were birth weight, persistence of umbilical catheter &gt; 7 days and persistence of peripheral arterial catheter &gt; 1 day. CONCLUSIONS The uses of umbilical catheter &gt; 7 days, peripheral arterial catheter &gt; 1 day and birth weight &lt; 1,500 g were significant determinants of nosocomial bloodstream infection risk. Because of the importance of invasive procedures as a source of nosocomial bloodstream infections, the lines duration needs to be reviewed with the aim of reducing the incidence of blood stream infection.</dc:description>
