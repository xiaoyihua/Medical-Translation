<dc:description xml:lang="en">Several clinical variables from a series of 101 patients with acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) operated on during the period 1979-1989 were compared with those from another group of 43 patients who were operated on during the period 1987-1989. Twenty-seven patients (26.7%) in the earlier period and 15 (34.8%) in the later one were younger than 40 years. The difference was not significant. There was a higher proportion of patients, 41 (40.5%), in the earlier period (1979-1982) who had traffic accidents than in the 1987-1989 period, where trauma was the mechanism in 15 patients (38.8%). However, the difference was not significant. Seven patients (6.9%) from the earlier group and 18 (41.9%) from the later group had a lucid interval. This difference was significant (p less than 0.001). During the 1979-1982 period 80 patients (79.2%) were comatose on admission as compared with 27 (62.7%) during 1987-1989. The difference was significant (p less than 0.05). A small group of 11 patients (10.8%) from the earlier series were operated on by means of craniotomy or trephine; by contrast, this approach was used in 35 (81.3%) patients from the later series. The difference was significant (p less than 0.001). Seventy-nine (78.2%) and 26 (60.4%) patients died in the periods 1979-1982 and 1987-1989, respectively. The difference between the mortality rates of both groups were significant (p less than 0.05). Our data suggest that the earlier diagnosis and the use of wider surgical procedures have contributed to the reduction in mortality.</dc:description>
