<dc:description xml:lang="en">We analyzed the two dimensional echocardiograms (2D echo) of 41 patients with infective endocarditis (IE). The diagnosis of endocarditis was based on typical clinical findings, positive blood cultures or anatomical findings at operation or necropsy. Age ranged from 21 to 73 years. Endocarditis was localized in a native valve in 30 patients (aortic 18, mitral 11 and tricuspid 1), a biologic prosthesis in 9 (mitral 4, aortic 4, unknown 1) and a mechanical valve in 4 (aortic 3, mitral 1). The echocardiogram showed vegetations, valve rupture or abscess in 83% of IE in native valves, 56% of IE in biologic prosthesis and 25% of IE in mechanical valves (p less than 0.05, native vs prosthetic valves). The sensitivity of 2D echo was studied in 27 subjects with known anatomical findings. It was 79% for vegetations (mitral 91%, aortic 72%, NS), 53% for valve rupture (mitral 83%, aortic 33%, p less than 0.05) and 70% for abscess. Specificity was over 89% for all lesions. Systemic embolism occurred in 41% of patients with vegetations and in 25% of those without (p = 0.07).</dc:description>
