<dc:description xml:lang="en">This is a retrospective study carried out in a group of 30 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (age at diagnosis equal to or less than twenty years old). The aim of the study is to evaluate outcome after 131I therapy. Patients were classified into three groups on the basis of initial surgery, pathology and scintigraphic results: group I (thyroid extent), group II (locoregional extent), and group III (distant metastatic disease). Clinical parameters, 131I scans, serum thyroglobulin determinations and 131I therapeutic administered doses were evaluated in the follow-up. Some other complementary techniques such as chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests are also described. Scintigraphic absence of thyroid tissue has been observed in 83% of the cases; high thyroglobulin level is still detectable in 34% of the patients as a single evidence of disease, and 21% remain without any abnormal clinical, scintigraphic or analytical findings. Total doses administered have increased in groups I, II and III respectively, and have also been inversely proportional to the extension of lymph node surgery. At present, all the patients are alive and in good general condition. According to the results obtained, we conclude that children and young adults with DTC should undergo periodical 131I therapeutic doses in case of positive scans (once total thyroidectomy has been realized, with or without lymph node resection depending on the extension of disease). In our experience, the use of radioiodine is effective and safe in the follow-up of children and youngs with DTC.</dc:description>
