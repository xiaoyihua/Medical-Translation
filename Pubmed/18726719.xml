<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The high demand for electrophysiological studies (EP studies) in paucisymptomatic patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) creates overloads in neurological examination departments. Most of these requests in the referenced section of our hospital come from primary health care, however it also comes from other specialists. Many EP Studies for CTS are normal or have minimal alterations so that no change in the therapeutic attitude is required. Thus, it is not clear whether EP studies are cost-effective for suspected CTS without clinical evidence of axonal degeneration. METHODS A decision-making and economic evaluation model was made to compare three strategies: option A (EP Studies for all patients with suspected CTS), option B (prior selection by neurologist and EP studies only if axonal CTS was suspected) and option C (prior selection by neurologist and EP studies only if CTS, axonal or otherwise was suspected). The study was conducted over a two month period on patients referred to the neurology department with suspected CTS. EP studies were considered to be the proof that established the final diagnosis. The consequences were determined in terms of correct diagnoses, cost and cost/effectiveness ratio for each strategy. A total number of 188 studies were performed, option C being the most cost-effective, but also the most expensive. CONCLUSIONS When there is neurological screening, the cost-effectiveness ratio is better but it is also more expensive. It is recommended to favor option A with intermediate cost and an acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio. However, this also generates great pressure on bud- 45 gets and care facilities which means that CTS diagnosis and criteria for referring patients to the neurological examination departments must be improved.</dc:description>
