<dc:description xml:lang="en">A male patient from Peru presented a nodule localized in the left costal region. All other clinical and laboratory data were normal. Upon biopsy, an helminth parasite emerged from the subcutaneous tissue, which presented a marked eosinophil infiltrate. The helminth was classified as a plerocercoid larva of Spirometra; the species was not determined. Since Spirometra are not common in Argentina, it is presumed that the patient was infested during his two year sojourn in the peruvian forest. Some epidemiological aspects are discussed. As far as we know, this is the first case of subcutaneous sparganosis and the second of sparganosis reported in Argentina.</dc:description>
