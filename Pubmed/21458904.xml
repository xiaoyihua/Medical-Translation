<dc:description xml:lang="en">Obesity, well known as a cardiovascular risk factor, can also lead to significant respiratory complications. The respiratory changes associated with obesity extend from a simple change in respiratory function, with no effect on gas exchange, to the more serious condition of hypercapnic respiratory failure, characteristic of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. More recently, it has been reported that there is an increased prevalence of asthma which is probably multifactorial in origin, but in which inflammation may play an important role. Hypoventilation in the obese subject is the result of complex interactions that involve changes in the ventilatory mechanics and anomalies in breathing control. Two other conditions (COPD and sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome [SAHS], often present in obese patients, can trigger or aggravate it. The prevalence of hypoventilation in the obese is under-estimated and the diagnosis is usually established during an exacerbation, or when the patient is studied due to suspicion of SAHS. Ventilatory management of these patients includes either CPAP or NIV. The choice of one or another will depend on the underlying clinical condition and whether or not there is another comorbidity. Both NIV and CPAP have demonstrated their effectiveness, not only in the control of gas exchange, but also in improving the quality of life and survival of these patients.</dc:description>
