<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The cytotoxicity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with lateral amyotrophic sclerosis in cell cultures that include neurons may be considered as a diffusion mechanism of the disease, due to the proximity of the CSF to the spinal column. DEVELOPMENT Various literature studies suggest that the motor neurons are more susceptible to cytotoxicity compared to other neuron cells, including glial, in cell cultures. The review of the composition of CSF in lateral amyotrophic sclerosis gives few clues on how this mechanism causes pre-apoptotic and apoptotic changes on the addition on CSF to the cultures, although it could be associated with the glutamate receptors, to a greater extent in those that respond to AMPA/kainate, and have a role in ion channels. CONCLUSIONS The cytotoxicity of CSF is a peculiarity of lateral amyotrophic sclerosis, which could explain some aspects of how the disease progresses. More studies are required in order to understand more about this mechanism, including better identification of patients from whom samples are obtained, as well as their characteristics, differentiating them into familial or sporadic.</dc:description>
