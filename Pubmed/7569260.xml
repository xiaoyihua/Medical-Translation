<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM The purpose of this study was to analyze the evolutionary changes of lipoprotein (a) levels occurring in heart transplant and to evaluate the possible relationship between the plasma concentration of this lipoprotein and the immunosuppressor drugs normally used in this type of transplant. METHOD 17 patients undergoing heart transplant and with no history of dyslipemia or dysglucemia were studied. Patients with metabolic alterations after the transplant were excluded (except when these alterations occurred during the first week), as well as those who showed intercurrent processes near to the determinations. These were performed before the transplant, and 1, 2, 4 and 6 months later. RESULTS An increase of lipoprotein (a) was observed after the transplant, with a subsequent progressive decrease. Significant differences were found between the levels prior to the transplant (9.18 +/- 8.66) and 6 months later (7.53 +/- 8.86), with no differences found between the previous concentrations and the determinations after one month (10.29 +/- 7.58), two months (8.06 +/- 7.90) and four months (8.82 +/- 7.84). Differences were also observed between the values of the first month in relation to the subsequent months, as well as between the 4th and the 6th month. No relationship was noticed between the levels of this lipoprotein and those of cyclosporin (r = 0.10), azatioprine (r = 0.17) and deflazacort (r = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS The lipoprotein (a) levels increase after heart transplant, with a subsequent gradual decrease even below the previous figures. These levels bear no relationship with the dose of immunosupressors normally used in heart transplant.</dc:description>
