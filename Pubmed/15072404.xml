<dc:description xml:lang="en">An 18-year-old woman pregnant at 37 weeks gestation and with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection was admitted with a clinical picture of pyelonephritis that responded favorably to antibiotic treatment. After 2 days, cervical ripening was induced with prostaglandin E2 gel and labor was induced with oxytocin. The patient requested epidural analgesia. Six hours after induction, cesarean delivery was indicated owing to risk of fetal distress. The operation was carried out under epidural anesthesia with 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine without a vasoconstrictor. After delivery, uterine atony was treated unsuccessfully with oxytocin and methylergometrine maleate; the obstetrician then gave an intramyometrial injection of 0.25 mg of 15-methyl-prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha). After 5 minutes, SpO2 fell to 89%, accompanied by dyspnea and sinus tachycardia of 130-140 beats/min, with normal cardiorespiratory sounds. The patient was transferred to the postoperative recovery unit, where a chest radiograph led to a diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema. Treatment to reduce edema was successful. PGF2alpha and its analogs are useful for treating uterine atony that does not respond to other drugs, but side effects are not unknown. Caution in prescribing PGF2alpha and care in monitoring the patient's reaction are therefore recommended during and after anesthesia. Unnecessary overhydration should be avoided.</dc:description>
