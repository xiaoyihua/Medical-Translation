<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cardiorespiratory arrest and the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation can occur anywhere, both in the out-of-hospital and in-hospital settings. Therefore, all healthcare centers (hospitals, primary care facilities, out-of-hospital emergency services) must be prepared to initiate life support procedures in children and to treat other life-threatening emergencies. To achieve this objective, adequate material including a full crash cart or resuscitation trolley is essential and must be available in all healthcare centers. Specific items contained in the trolley can vary according to the characteristics of the facility and the most probable type of resuscitation needed (for example, neonatal resuscitation). At least one resuscitation trolley must be available in primary care centers, pediatric intensive care units, emergency departments, out-of-hospital emergency services, and pediatric wards. The trolley must be located in an easily accessible site and must contain only indispensable material. It is essential to include instruments in several sizes, covering children of all ages, as well as enough spare instruments and medications that could be required during resuscitation. The material must be checked periodically and all the staff (physicians, nurses, and auxiliary personnel) must be familiar with the trolley's contents and the location of all material and drugs.</dc:description>
