<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Laparoscopic technique has been developed with the aim to decrease the morbidity of the open radical prostatectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS From january 2002 to may 2002, 8 patients were treated for prostate cancer with laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Unilateral linfadenectomy has been carried out in only one patient. We usually employ the transperitoneal technique published by the Montsouris Institute, with some modifications. RESULTS The main surgical time was 356 minutes (540-240). Transfusion wasn't needed in any case. Intraoperative complications were: 2 bladder injuries, 1 bleeding of the epigastric artery. Postoperative complications were: 1 ileus, 2 compressive neurapraxia, 4 anastomotic fistutas. All complications were treated conservatively. No patient were converted to open surgery. Surgical limits were negatifs in all cases, and the PSA rate was less than 0.1 ng/ml in the first month follow up. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is a difficult technique, but we think that, the learning curve is getting lower and lower than in the first series. Oncologic results with this technique is similar to the open one. However, laparoscopic approach shows us some benefits such as less bleeding, less time catheterisation, less hospital stay, better continence, better sexual function, better stetic result, less postoperative pain, and finally an earlier back to work.</dc:description>
