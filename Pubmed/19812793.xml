<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to estimate the rate of use, costs and details of psychotherapeutic treatment in general population of suburban Buenos Aires along with patient demographic characteristics. METHODS A survey was conducted between September and November 2007 among 899 inhabitants of 11 districts in greater Buenos Aires. RESULTS During the previous month 14,2% of the population received psychotherapy treatment. Lifetime prevalence of psychotherapy was 42,8%. Use of psychotherapy was higher among women, the widowed, middle aged individuals and persons with higher socioeconomic status and levels of education. Almost 40% of the individuals in psychotherapy at the time of the survey reported receiving psychoanalytic treatment, 10% reported receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy while 41% was not aware of the type of psychotherapy received. Treatments were conducted mainly by psychologists (85%) and the majority consisted of individual psychotherapy in a private practice setting. Mean duration of a psychotherapy session was 52 minutes. A positive correlation was found between the duration of a session and its cost . There were no overall differences in the rate of use of psychotherapy between different areas of greater Buenos Aires, nor between these areas and previous estimates of prevalence in the city of Buenos Aires. CONCLUSIONS Psychotherapy use in greater Buenos Aires is higher than in other countries. However, the rate of use is lower for certain socioeconomic and age groups. Further research is needed to determine whether the treatments observed are appropriate for the mental health needs of this population.</dc:description>
