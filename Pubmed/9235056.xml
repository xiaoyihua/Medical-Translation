<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND We present two outbreaks of trichinosis occurred in the last two years in Navarre. METHODS After the detection of the initial case, an epidemiological study of all people presumably infected was carried out. We used the latex agglutination and ELISA tests to detect specific antibodies. We studied the characteristics of the infested meat, as well as the clinical symptoms, eosinophil counts and serologic status of the subjects. After three and twelve months those items were again monitored. RESULTS 71 subjects who had ingested the infected meat were detected. Of them, 67 (94.3%) were enrolled in the study, 34 being involved in the first outbreak and 33 in the second. 15 (22.5%) of the 67 cases had symptoms suggestive of trichinosis, 30 (44.7%) had hypereosinophilia, and 25 (38%) had positive serologic test results. 25 subjects (38%) were diagnosed as having trichinosis. Two groups were made according to the characteristics of the meat consumed: 34 subjects (50.7%) had ingested thoroughly cooked meat (group A), whereas 33 (49%) had ingested poorly cooked meat (group B). After three months, only 5 patients were symptomatic and 10 had a high eosinophil count. After 12 months, all subjects were asymptomatic, had normal eosinophil counts and negative serologies. CONCLUSIONS 1) An epidemiological survey and serologic determinations for trichina should be carried out when studying hypereosinophilia. 2) It is important to insist on the necessity of veterinary inspection of home-made pork products. 3) The ingestion of poorly cooked pork products increases the risk of Trichinella infection.</dc:description>
