<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Recently has been described alterations in different organs of HIV + patients treated with zidovudine (AZT), as secondary effect from drug administration. METHOD We have developed and experimental rat model, in which the rats were administered AZT in drinking water and we have analysed the activity of enzyme isocitrate DH, of Krebs cycle, in hepatic tissue sections. Histological technique were employed and image analysis to objectivate the results. RESULTS A significant statistic decrease of the enzyme activity in those animals treated with AZT were observed, compared with the control groups. CONCLUSIONS The modification from enzyme activities related with Krebs cycle can be traduced in mitochondrial alterations, that could have direct or indirect influence in the appearance of some associated pathologies to the AZT treatment.</dc:description>
