<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Falls are the second leading cause of accidental or unintentional injury deaths worldwide, also, falls generate severe disabilities, institutionalization and increase healthcare costs. People with intellectual disabilities (ID) fall over frecuently. It's due to they are usually sicker than the rest of the population, and for environmental, professional and organizational factors. The aim of the study was to assess risk factors and injury due to falls. Also the methods of assessment and prevention of falls were analyzed. METHODOLOGY. It was carried out a literature review. We searched for articles in major biomedical databases and on the website of the Spanish Confederation of Organizations for Persons with Intellectual Disability (FEAPS). Sixteen studies were analyzed. The articles analyzed showed that age, history of seizures, gait and behavioral problems and environmental factors were the main risk factors for falling. Many fallers (84 6%) had suffered injuries. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS There is no consensus on an appropriate instrument to assess the risks factors and problems that cause falls. These instruments have not been validated in Spanish. A few suggestions found to prevent falls and injury in people with intellectual disability are based on educational and environmental approaches. The best way to contribute to the prevention could be research on intervention programs and organizational and staff characteristics. Nurses must lead these investigations.</dc:description>
