<dc:description xml:lang="en">Consulting in child psychology in collaboration with the pediatric hospital service, gave way to a growing interest to learn and take in consideration psychological problems of children. Six drawings by children are presented about subjects of hospitalization and in which the physician takes on a familiar psychological value that goes beyond the diagnosis and somatic treatment. The affective states which children show in their drawings when they are hospitalized and the work of the physician are discussed. Some psychoprophylactic means are suggested for hospitalization, surgical operations and serious somatic illnesses that can lead to a premature death. The child's biography and what the physician can observe in his family visits, are basic elements in the psychosomatic approach. The drawing gives elements about the internal state of the child in the hospital atmosphere and preliminary indications on individual psychotherapy treatment.</dc:description>
