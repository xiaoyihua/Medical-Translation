<dc:description xml:lang="en">A genomic expression library of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) was made using plasmid pcDNA3 as a vector, with which male mice from the Balb/c isogenic line were intramuscullary inoculated. It was used a positive control group that was administered soluble antigens of T. cruzi. Other 2 groups received genomic and plasmid DNA, respectively. One group was not immunized. Weekly blood samples were obtained from all the animals until the fourth week and 2 weeks after reimmunization to study the response of specific antibodies against the microorganism antigens by an indirect immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA). It was observed a significant increase of specific antibodies in the animals reimmunized with 50 micrograms of the library, as well as in the group immunized with soluble antigens of T. cruzi.</dc:description>
