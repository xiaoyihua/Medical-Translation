<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by several species from Leishmania genus, which has been increasingly reported in the last few years. Several genetic, immunological factors and others related to this parasite have been associated to the outcome of the infection, and the occurrence of illness in varied clinical forms. All the aforementioned has an impact on the diagnostic method that should be used. METHODS A basic and recent literature review was made, mainly focused on general aspects of leishmaniasis as epidemiological situation of disease, life cycle and transmission, vectors, clinical presentation and diagnosis; the latter shows information about the main methods used at present. The procedure followed by the Leishmania group at "Pedro Kourí" Institute of Tropical Medicine to support the diagnostic activities was presented as well. RESULTS Updated practical information about the chosen topics was presented, with a practical guiding approach aimed at the health personnel that must face suspected leishmaniasis cases. Tables and figures summarized relevant aspects in an organized form, as well as the working algorithm of Institute concerning diagnosis was presented. The application of molecular diagnosis by this working team was particularly underlined. CONCLUSIONS As leishmaniasis is still out of control, opportune diagnosis remains a must. All the methods provide useful information for taking decisions on clinical management, treatment and epidemiology of this parasitosis; hence, a working algorithm was submitted in our lab based on the most useful methods under our present conditions and experience.</dc:description>
