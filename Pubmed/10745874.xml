<dc:description xml:lang="en">Sudden infant crib syndrome in nursing newborns means the syndrome which affects those babies less than one year old whose death can not be explained even after the conclusion of an in depth investigation. This article explains the causes currently provided as possible factors which cause this syndrome, risk factors supported by epidemiological data and preventive measures including the monitoring of babies deemed to be at risk. The authors also specify what this monitoring consists of and they elaborate a proposed nurses' action plan for the newborn and his/her family for those cases in which monitoring is taking place. The authors also present a proposed nurses' action plan in the event of a newborn's death due to this syndrome.</dc:description>
