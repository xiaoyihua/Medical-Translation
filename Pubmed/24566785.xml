<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Vulvovaginitis accounts for 25% of all pediatric gynecology consultations. OBJECTIVE To assess the etiology of vulvovaginitis based on age and Tanner staging of breast development. MATERIAL AND METHODS Descriptive, cross-sectional study conducted between January 1st and December 31st, 2011. Patients with vulvovaginitis were assessed based on two outcome measures: age group (GI: 0 to 8.9 years old, GII: 9 to 15.9 years old, and GIII: 16 to 18 years old), and the Tanner staging of breast development (I, II-III, IV-V). Results. Two hundred and twenty-nine patients were included, 78 girls in the GI group, 134 in the GII group, and 17 in the GIII group; 81 girls were classified as TI, 36 as TII-III, and 112 as TIV-V based on Tanner staging. Shigella and Oxyuris were the most commonly found etiologic agents in younger girls. Candida albicans, other Candida species, Gardnerella and Ureaplasma urealyticum were the germs most commonly observed in older patients. Oxyuris was predominant in prepubertal girls, while Candida albicans, in postpubertal girls. CONCLUSIONS Hormonal influence was more relevant than the patient's age in terms of vulvovaginitis etiology.</dc:description>
