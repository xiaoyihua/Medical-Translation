<dc:description xml:lang="en">The results of a semi-longitudinal growth study of children from an upper socioeconomic stratum (SES), 0 to 17 years of age, are reported. Medical records of 6,000 boys and girls who were seen in the pediatric outpatient department of Clínica Las Condes, Santiago, during the period January 1983-December 1987 were reviewed. Data of height (H), weight (W) and head circumference (HC) of 4,800 normal children were obtained; the totals of recorded measurements were 13,000 for H, 13,000 for W and 5,800 for HC. The information is presented in 13 Tables and 32 Figures and it was compared to that from a longitudinal study in children of lower SES in Northern Metropolitan Santiago. Females of the upper stratum are taller at all ages, but W for H ratio is higher in girls of the low stratum. H and W for age values are higher in boys of the upper stratum, but W for H ratio is similar in both socioeconomic groups. The age of peak height velocity is the same in both groups for both sexes. We conclude that the stated differences in growth and weight gain between these two socioeconomic groups are better explained by genetic than by nutritional factors.</dc:description>
