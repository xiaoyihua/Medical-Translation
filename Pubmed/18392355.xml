<dc:description xml:lang="en">The relationship between environmental factors and health is well known. Rural environmental influences on reproductive health have been properly proved, both in animals and humans. In Latin America, few studies have been conducted in this area. The current project is based on the description of relationships between reproductive health and environmental factors in rural populations, characterized by specific environmental characteristics. Three variables were evaluated: male-to-female birth ratio, male urogenital malformations (cryptorchidism and hypospadias), and endocrine-related cancer incidence. Five rural communities in the Pampa Humeda in Argentina were selected, and the data were compared to the national mean. Biomedical data and environmental risk factors were correlated through a geographic information system. The ratio of male to female births did not show any differences. Malformations showed very significant differences. Endocrine-related cancers showed higher incidence rates compared to the national mean, particularly in some communities. In conclusion, there is a relationship between environmental factors and reproductive health conditions in this region.</dc:description>
