<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Microtransplantation of fetal dopaminergic cells has been used over the past ten years with good results in models of Parkinson's disease. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of microtransplantation of fetal dopaminergic cells 'seeded' in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) and striate (St) simultaneously. MATERIAL AND METHODS The animals received a transplant or microtransplant of cells into the St and SNpr ipsilateral to the lesion in the substantia nigra pars compacta or to both regions. Depending on the site and technique used the following experimental groups were considered: I. Macrotransplantation to the St (n = 20); II. Microtransplant to the St (n = 20); III. Microtransplant to St + SNpr (n = 20); IV. Microtransplant to St + SNpr (n = 20); V. Macrotransplantation to SNpr (n = 20); VI. Microtransplantation to SNpr (n = 20); and VII. Control (lesion only) (n = 20). The rotations induced by D-amphetamine (5 mg/kg i.p.) and by apomorphine were studied 1, 2, 3 and 6 months and 3 and 6 months respectively after transplantation. Three months after transplantation we studied the motor asymmetry shown by the animals by means of the ladder test. RESULTS The rotations were reduced in the groups with intrastriate transplantation. Comparison between the surgical techniques showed nonsignificant differences between them. The ladder test showed significant differences in use of the limbs in all experimental groups. Use of the left limb was significantly reduced in all groups. CONCLUSIONS Modification of the rotations seems more sensitive to the site of transplant than to the technique used. It seems that the skills studied using the ladder test are not altered by the microtransplant technique.</dc:description>
