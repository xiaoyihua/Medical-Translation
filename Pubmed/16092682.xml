<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the incidence of surgical complications its diagnosis and treatment after renal transplantation. METHODS A retrospective study measuring the incidence of surgical complications and reviewing its diagnosis and treatment in 185 renal single transplants. RESULTS 185 transplants, 27% had surgical complications. Only one patient lost the graft due to surgical complications and there was no associated mortality. Cold ischemia time 20 hours. Double J stenting in 19%, under surgeon's opinion. Vascular complications 3.2% (all of them renal artery stenosis). Urological complications 6.4%. Perinephric haematoma 7%. Lymphocele 4.9%. Peritoneum related complications 4%. Other 4%. The diagnosis was clinical and radiological in most of cases. 14% needed any kind of intervention. CONCLUSIONS Our results are similar to those reported in other recent series. Only one surgical team involved and the same technique for vascular and vesico-ureteric anastomosis probably makes lower our complications rate. Early postoperative abdominal ultrasonography contributes to the diagnosis of surgical complications. The initial treatment approach is the endoscopic-conservative one, with exceptions.</dc:description>
