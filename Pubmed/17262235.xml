<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To determine the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment features in a group of pediatric patients with cataracts treated at our hospital. The aim was to improve the visual prognosis in these patients. METHODS 79 children with cataracts were reviewed retrospectively during an 18 year period (1986-2004). This involved patients with congenital cataracts and those who acquired them later. Most of the latter group had a traumatic etiology (90%). RESULTS The etiology of most cataracts was idiopathic (68%) for the congenital group and traumatic (90%) for the acquired group. Congenital cataracts were frequently nuclear in type (31%) with 56% being bilateral. 27% of the congenital group were associated with dysmorphic eye features, the most frequent being microphthalmos. The most frequent presenting feature was leucokoria, seen in 44% of patients. 75% of congenital cataracts were diagnosed within one month of clinical manifestation. 58% of the congenital cataracts were treated by surgery and 50% of these were performed within one month of the diagnosis. 90% of the acquired cataracts were treated surgically, and 95% of these were performed less than one month after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS We attained a prompt diagnosis and treatment in a high percentage of cases. Prompt diagnosis and treatment will determine the visual prognosis of these patients. We must continue trying to shorten this period of time in order that all children with this condition are diagnosed and treated urgently and efficiently.</dc:description>
