<dc:description xml:lang="en">The results of the treatment of acromegaly in 56 patients have been reviewed. Transsphenoidal pituitary adenomectomy (TPA) represented the most effective therapy, as it resulted in a cure rate of 64.7%, with 8.8% of complications and 14.7% of endocrine insufficiencies secondary to surgery. When radiotherapy was administered after surgery (when the latter had not been curative), the overall rate of cure increased to 73.5%. By contrast, the patients treated only with radiotherapy had a markedly lower cure rate (44.4%), with a higher rate of endocrine insufficiency (55%). The occurrence of extrasellar extension shown in preoperative pituitary computed tomography did not correlate with a worse postoperative cure rate; by contrast, the invasive character of the adenoma represented a reduction in the postoperative cure rate. It was concluded that TPA is the treatment of choice in acromegaly, independently of the tumor size.</dc:description>
