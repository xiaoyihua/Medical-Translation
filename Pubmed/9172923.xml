<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a type of pathology which has many predisposing factors and forms of presentation, which make diagnosis and prognosis difficult. The objective of this paper is to review, and bring up to date, different aspects of knowledge concerning: aetiology, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment. MAIN FINDINGS The proportion of cases of unknown aetiology is between 20-35% in spite of new causes being described. Magnetic resonance and recently, angiographic resonance are the diagnostic methods of choice, although conventional angiography is still necessary in some cases. The treatment of CVT is based on correction of the cause, control of symptoms and the use of anti-thrombotic drugs, mainly anticoagulants and more recently, fibrinolytic agents. The mortality of current series of patients is 10-15% and only 15-25% of the patients show sequelae. CONCLUSIONS CVT is not rare and neuro-imaging techniques allow early diagnosis of more cases. In general prognosis is good. Antithrombotic treatment is still controversial and further study is necessary in this field.</dc:description>
