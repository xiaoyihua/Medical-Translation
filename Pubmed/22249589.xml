<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Deficiencies detected in biomedical studies publication different Guidelines to improve. The objective of the study is to assess the communication of observational studies of Cardiovascular and Metabolism therapeutic area (CVM) published in 6 Spanish journals in 2009 using the STROBE statement. METHODS Cross-sectional analysis of articles related to CVM therapeutic area, published during 2009 in 6 Spanish journals applying the 34 items of the STROBE statement. Descriptive analysis of the results for qualitative variables was performed using a frequency analysis. Quantitative variables were analyzed by sample estimates and dispersion. A comparative analysis of journals was performed using ANOVA with a statistical significance of p&lt;0.05. RESULTS Throughout 2009, 74 CVM observational studies were published in the evaluated journals. The most frequent design were cohorts 45 (60.8%) and cross-sectional 28 (37.8%). The study main objective was on pathology 55 (74.3%), followed by drug and non-pharmacological interventions 15 (20.3%) and diagnosis 4 (5.4%). The mean of complied items was 20 on 34 (DE±3.7), with a maximum of 24 (DE±2) in Gaceta Sanitaria and a minimum of 19 (DE±2.8) in Hipertensión. CONCLUSIONS Evaluated papers comply with slightly more than a half items (58%) of the STROBE recommendations. The Methods and Results sections showed more deficiencies.</dc:description>
