<dc:description xml:lang="en">The first case of Q fever endocarditis that has been diagnosed in Mexico is presented. A 10-year-old girl with discrete subaortic stenosis (SAS) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was seen in December of 1996 with fever, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. She presented also anemia, leukopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, positive rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulinemia, antinuclear and anticytoplasmic antibodies (anti-RNA-proteins and anti-DNA). An aortic valve vegetation was seen by echocardiogram. Blood-cultures were negative. Antibody test for Coxiella burnetii was positive. Treatment with doxicyclin was initiated as soon the diagnosis was done. PDA was closed, SAS was liberated and two aortic vegetations were resected. Endocarditis in Q fever occurs when there is predisposing heart disease and/or immunodeficiency. Effective therapy has not yet been established. The diagnosis of Q fever endocarditis is difficult; it should be considered, in case of clinical suspicion of endocarditis with negative blood-cultures.</dc:description>
