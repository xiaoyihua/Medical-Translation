<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cardiovascular risk factor and is associated with mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, few studies have been carried out in patients on haemodialysis (HD). OBJECTIVES The objective of the study is to analyse the effect of MS on the occurrence of cardiovascular events in HD. The secondary objective is to determine the influence of the fat tissue index and conicity index on cardiovascular events. METHODS A prospective study including 100 patients on HD. The follow-up period was 3 years. Cardiovascular events and mortality were recorded. MS was defined in accordance with ATPIII and IDF criteria. RESULTS MS prevalence as defined by the ATPIII was 32%, and by the IDF, 29%. The concordance between the two definitions was high (kappa index 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.92). The risk of cardiovascular events was higher in patients with MS (Log Rank 6.185, p = 0.013), with a fat tissue index greater than 11.5 kg/m(2) (log rank 10.220, p=.001) and a conicity index greater than 1.2 (log rank 6.393, p=.011). In the Cox analysis, adjusted for age and sex, patients with MS had twice the risk of being admitted due to a cardiovascular event (odds ratio 1.93, 1.022 to 3.6, p=.043). Mortality was 35% in the 3 year follow-up period with no differences between the groups with and without MS. CONCLUSIONS MS is a very prevalent disease in HD patients and its presence doubles the risk of hospitalisation due to cardiovascular events in the short term.</dc:description>
