<dc:description xml:lang="en">Several new coronary dilatation systems, including those using laser energy, atherectomy devices and stent implantation, are being developed as alternative or complementary procedures to coronary artery balloon angioplasty. We report our initial experience performing coronary angioplasty with a new rotational atherectomy device, the transluminal extraction catheter, which simultaneously cut and aspirate fragments from the atherosclerotic plaque. The components of the whole system are a special guidewire to cross the stenosis, the atherectomy catheter and the conduction-control unit. This unit, connected when the atherectomy catheter is positioned across the lesion, produces rotation of the conical bladder located in the catheter distal tip and simultaneous aspiration of residual particles. The procedure was performed in 11 patients in whom 13 lesions were dilated. All patients were male (mean age 55 +/- 23 years, range 45-77). The reason for the angioplasty was stable angina in 2 patients and unstable angina in the remaining seven. Initial success (residual stenosis less than 50% of vessel diameter) was obtained in 10 of 13 lesions. In two, conventional balloon angioplasty was required to improve atherectomy result. The only unsuccessful procedure was in a proximal right coronary artery venous graft, in which a large dissection occurred. Patient had angina but no myocardial infarction. Pathologic examination of aspirated material revealed fibrous tissue in 12 cases and cholesterol crystals in four. We conclude, with the limitation of a preliminary study, that rotational atherectomy with the transluminal extraction catheter is a useful procedure to relief coronary stenosis of the coronary arteries.</dc:description>
