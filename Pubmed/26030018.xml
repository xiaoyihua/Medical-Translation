<dc:description xml:lang="en">Contemporary reality presents the paradoxical world of information at its most extensive against the subsequent global spread of the individual's isolation. Isolation presented from the perspective of Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurismäki. His film The Match Factory Girl is a story about human frailty, which brings us to recognize some of the weaknesses of our time and at the same time allows us to expose a bioethical analysis that aims to go beyond sociological reflection on cultural anthropology in the Western world. The attitude towards the life of the protagonist shows the ambivalence of personal values as opposed to the social counter values, placing the pregnant woman at a crossroads of responses that make violence the manifestation of learning from a relational and emotional origin. Aggression that puts the woman in the position of silent suffering victim of human conflict, as is abortion that is ingrained and coexisting opposing emotions. The reality of the young woman can be analysed from the behavioural somatization that has reduced her personal dignity to the value of an object that, under probably post traumatic effects, that directs her individual freedom towards an inconsequential personal destiny.</dc:description>
