<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thirty healthy individuals with no history of cardiovascular disease were studied to determine the electrocardiographic effects of maximal exercise immediately followed by ingestion of ice water. The subjects were subgrouped according to their training into (A) high (N = 5), (B) moderate (N = 14) and (C) low (N = 11) levels. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were taken at rest and at rest with ingestion of ice water followed by maximal stress tests. Maximal stress tests were repeated followed by ingestion of ice water at the beginning of and at 2, 3, 6 and 9 minutes of recuperation. The stress test combining maximal effort and ice water ingestion was positive in all members of Group A, in 4 from Group B and in 1 from Group C. A stress test associating maximal effort with ice water ingestion is a useful method of detecting subjects susceptible to changes in ECG which appear to be secondary to coronary spasm. It has a low cost it is simple to perform and represents minimal risk.</dc:description>
