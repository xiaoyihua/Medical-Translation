<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cocaine consumption in Spain continues to rise and is reaching an alarming level. This is a descriptive and correlational study in which a transcultural analysis is made with a sample of 62 different countries. The aim of this study is to compare the influence of macrosocial, cultural and economic variables on the behaviour of cocaine abuse. Thus, the importance of the cocaine traffic and supply is shown in relation to the abuse of the same, but recognition and emphasis is given to the presence of other explanatory factors characteristic of societies in which cocaine is abused and demanded. These factors are: predominance of cultural values of self-expression, high index of subjective wellbeing and a high GNP per capita. Finally, the relevance of social factors, environment and socio-economic context, as determinants of cocaine abuse from a trans-cultural perspective, are discussed. The implementation of different actions is proposed: the promotion of values oriented towards self-regulation and self-control, the control of the cocaine supply (direct and indirect), combating early cultural destruction by means of publicity and promoting cultural creation and the diversification of leisure.</dc:description>
