<dc:description xml:lang="en">Gastric cancer (GC) exhibits significant rates of mortality worldwide, a situation that is even more disturbing in Colombia, because it has had historically high rate for that disease; At regional context we have found that Boyacá has the second place of gastric cancer mortality rate in the country, with displeasing numbers. Early detection is critical to the survival of people, so in this article, major based on world literature search, we show that the microRNA could be a useful tool for the diagnosis, prognosis and can be designed as important therapeutic target. Aims to this are demonstrate howmiRNAs are deregulated during the emergence and development of gastric cancer and how their biological functions can place them as oncogenes or tumor suppressors; finally, we showed that two microRNAs (miR-21 and miR-106b) are significantly upregulated in the disease and may have a pro-oncogenic action, blocking normal cell cycle, apoptosis and migration.</dc:description>
