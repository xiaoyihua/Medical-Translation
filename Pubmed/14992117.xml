<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety of the CO2 Laser Cordectomy in the treatment of glottic carcinoma as a day-case procedure. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective study of a cohort of 30 patients with glottic carcinoma treated with CO2 Laser Cordectomy at our institution between 1999-2001 as a day-case procedure. RESULTS There were no major complications and no patients required re-intubation. 90% of the patients were discharged the same day of the procedure. There were three unplanned admissions to the hospital but none of them were, in our opinion, the direct result of Cordectomy. These patients were discharged the next day. 100% of the patients answered that they would repeat the experience. CONCLUSIONS CO2 Laser Cordectomy of the glottic carcinoma can be safely performed as an outpatient procedure if patients are selected according to specific day-case criteria.</dc:description>
