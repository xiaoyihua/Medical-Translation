<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since their aparition in 1980, percutaneus endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), represented a dramatic impact in the enteral nutrition thecnics and their indication have expanded. The PEG have many advantages over the surgical gastrostomy. In this paper, we present our experience with the use of PEG in patients with head and neck cancer using a new home made gastrostome. Included were 61 patients 37 males (64.8%), 21 females (36.2%) with ages betwen 11 and 72 years. In 3 patients the PEG was not intended because tight esophageal stenoses. The PEG was completed in 56 cases (91.8%). In 5 patients (8.6%) there were minor complications (4 infections and 1 patient with pain). We have only one case of major complication which consisted in migration of gastrotome to the abdominal wall (Buried Bumper Syndrome). The gastrostome was patent between 15 and 312 days with a median of 125 days. The gastrostomies was made with siliconed 22Fr Foley catheter, crazy glue, and plastic tops. The Foley catheter is acid resistant and not deteriorate like other materials like latex. There was not adverse reaction at the ostomy site. The cost of the kit is about 11 US$ and the commercial kit is 125 US$, on the other hand the internal diameter is 15% wider than the commercial one.</dc:description>
