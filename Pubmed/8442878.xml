<dc:description xml:lang="en">Between January to October 1991, were studied 148 samples of feces corresponding to the same number of children with acute diarrhea. In 41 (27.7%) samples, were found macroscopic or microscopic blood. At least one associated bacterial pathogen capable to produce bloody diarrhea was isolated from 22 (53.7%) of these samples. Were isolated five (12.2%) Salmonella strains, all of them were S. enteritidis; nine (22.0%) Shigella: seven S. flexneri, one S. boydii, and other one S. sonnei; two (4.9%) enteroinvasive Escherichia coli strains, and six (14.6%) Campylobacter jejuni strains. A single associated invasive bacterial pathogen was isolated in 13 (31.7%) children. Mixed culture were found in nine children: five (12.2%) children had invasive pathogens association, and four (9.8%) children had invasive and no invasive pathogens association.</dc:description>
