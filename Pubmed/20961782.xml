<dc:description xml:lang="en">The number of people suffering from overweight and obesity has grown in Spain in recent years and the number of specialists warning us of an epidemic continues to rise. In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the alarm in the European Charter on counteracting obesity. Two years later, a number of scientific societies and health organizations at international level agreed that obesity should be treated as a disease and vigorously approached. Asturias is not the exception; for instance between 2002 and 2008 the prevalence of morbid obesity increased from 0.4% to 5.1% in the community. In view of this data it seems essential to launch specific programmes to reverse this trend. In this work we will propose some measures that can be carried out at the primary care level in the public health service in order to offer quality and individualized care plans both to adult and children. First, the need of an exhaustive questionnaire on diet and physical activity to be included in the program of obesity of the clinical computerized history is suggested. Secondly, the Health Administration should promote specific courses on obesity, before the new obesity program was released. Thirdly, institutional publicising of Clinical Guidelines on obesity based on the scientific evidence is recommended so that health professionals are made aware of the importance of this disease.</dc:description>
