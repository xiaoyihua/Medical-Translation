<dc:description xml:lang="en">Screening mammogram utilization is a critical issue in early detection of breast cancer. However, it is underutilized by different sectors, particularly low-income women. The objective of this study was to utilize the method known as focus group to probe into obstacles to screening mammogram among low-income women in the ages 40 to 64 in Puerto Rico once they had a physician's referral. The women in the study had knowledge of breast self-examination, clinical breast exam and mammogram as tests to detect breast cancer. Yet, they had no adequate knowledge about current screening guidelines. Attitudes toward pain or discomfort related to the mammogram and fear of a breast cancer diagnosis were the personal reasons most often cited for non-compliance in the focus group discussions. In the case of external or systemic barriers, the most prevalent reasons offered were: cost of the mammogram, transportation, and negative factors associated to the doctor-patient relationship.</dc:description>
