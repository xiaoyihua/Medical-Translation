<dc:description xml:lang="en">We review the different cardiovascular effects exerted by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, obtained in several experimental and clinical studies in the last twenty years, in patients with arterial hypertension and different cardiovascular pathologies related to the hypertensive process. We will review the mechanistic basis of the cardiovascular protective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. These drugs, as monotherapy or combined therapy, can achieve blood pressure control in a high proportion of hypertensive patients; in hypertensive patients with diabetes these drugs are especially indicated, and also are the drugs of choice in diabetic hypertensive patients with cardiac dysfunction due to ischaemic cardiomyopathy. This group of drugs has the highest effect among the drugs available today in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy associated with the hypertensive process. There are many experimental and clinical data that suggest the potential role of the angiotensin converting enzyme antagonists limiting the atherosclerotic process.</dc:description>
