<dc:description xml:lang="en">The appearance of procedures derived from video assisted thoracoscopy (VAT) has fostered new breakthroughs in the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax. Our early experience with a study protocol using this technique is described. Patients admitted to our hospital in 1995 with a diagnosis of spontaneous pneumothorax were enrolled consecutively. Diagnosis was based on symptoms and pneumothorax was quantified by measuring the interpleural distance observed on the chest film. The initial treatment was pleural drainage; VAT was ordered in cases of recurrence, when lung reexpansion failed or when air leakage was persistent. Forty-five cases (30 men, 15 women) are reported. Mean age was 29 years. Eleven (24%) patients had had earlier pleural drainage but were suffering recurrences. The right side was involved in 14 (54%) cases. Initial treatment was pleural drainage and in 32 cases no other treatment was given. VAT was performed on 11 patients. In 1 (9%) patient the procedure became a minithoracotomy, or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. In 2 patients conventional thoracotomy was performed. Mean time the procedure lasted was 80 min. Mean follow-up was 3 months. There were no recurrences among patients treated with VAT and surgery. Our initial experience demonstrates that VAT is the technique of preference for the definitive treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax. There is less postoperative pain, increased comfort, no noteworthy morbidity, shorter postoperative hospital stays and prompt return to normal activity for the patient; these advantages lead us to choose this treatment over open surgery.</dc:description>
