<dc:description xml:lang="en">Currently, 15% to 30% of the patients that undergo coronary artery surgery are diabetics. As a group, they have less favorable anatomic and clinical characteristics than the general population. Specifically, diabetics have more extensive coronary disease, more vessels involved, and more diffuse stenosis, so they need a higher number of distal anastomoses to achieve complete revascularization. In spite of these drawbacks, they can undergo coronary artery bypass procedures with an operative mortality similar to that of non-diabetic patients. However, some postoperative complications are significantly more prevalent among diabetics, mainly renal failure, neurological accidents, sternal dehiscence, and infection. In early studies of the late results of surgical revascularization, mainly based on venous grafts, late survival and clinical improvement were less satisfactory in diabetics than in non-diabetics. However, in recent experiences, in which the internal mammary artery has been used extensively, the clinical outcome of diabetics has been similar to that of non-diabetics, confirming this procedure as the preferred one in revascularizing the coronary arteries of diabetics with multivessel disease. Off-pump surgery and extensive use of arterial grafts are becoming established strategies for reducing operative risk and improving long-term clinical results. However, continuous, strict medical management of hyperglycemia and other known coronary risk factors, especially lipid levels, is essential.</dc:description>
