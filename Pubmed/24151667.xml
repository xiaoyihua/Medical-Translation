<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of the following paper is to present a project developed within the framework of collaboration between two foundations, Fundación Kaleidos (Argentina) and Children Action (Switzerland). The aim of this project is to developed diverse programs to support and empower adolescent mothers and fathers as well as their children. Adolescents whose rights are very often not respected and who find themselves alone having to confront the negative prejudices of the adults around them regarding the parenthood, which they now face. The objectives of the programs are as follows: the promotion of the well-being of the adolescents and the development of a personal project around education or work, the promotion of early child development of their infants, to address the problems around gender inequality and the promotion of an intersectional network between distinct sectors of society (public, private and NGO). By means of an integral program, we aim to tackle the diverse aspects of the lives of the adolescents in question and their children. Their rights and their environment are key to developing the maximum potential of each individual and their families.</dc:description>
