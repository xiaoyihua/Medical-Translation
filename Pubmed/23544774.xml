<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease in adults is the first cause of death, and in adolescents under 15 years old, it is the third cause of death. The purpose of this study was to investigate which risk factors for cardiovascular disease have the children of parents with diabetes or hypertension. MATERIAL AND METHODS In a cross-sectional study conducted in the Family Medicine Unit No. 80 in Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico, were included 156 patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and without diabetes or hypertension (10 years of disease progression), and a biological child (age 7-15 years) to form pairs. Three groups were formed: child-parent with Diabetes; child-parent with Hypertension and child-parent without Diabetes or Hypertension. Medical history, body mass index, blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, c-LDL, c-HDL and signs of metabolic syndrome were recorded. RESULTS The frequency of signs of metabolic syndrome was higher in parents with Diabetes (28.8%), and in children of parents without either diabetes or hypertension (11.5%). In binomial children-parents with Diabetes, serum glucose (OR=4.50: 95% CI; 2.32-8.73, P&lt;.0001) was the most important risk factor to develop cardiovascular disease; in binomial children-parents with Hypertension it was total cholesterol (OR=4.143: 95% CI; 1.996-8.60, P&lt;.0001); and, in binomial children-parents without either Diabetes or Hypertension, the abdominal circumference (OR=3.429: 95% CI; 1.621-7.251, P&lt;.0001) was the most important risk factor. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that children of parents with or without diabetes mellitus or hypertension are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Longitudinal studies are required using non-pharmacological and pharmacological strategies that will have an impact on the most important risk factors for preventing cardiovascular disease.</dc:description>
