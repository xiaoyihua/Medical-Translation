<dc:description xml:lang="en">Systemic methodology is restored to so that a demonstration is made which shows hallucination not being an independent element. Quite contrary, it is the author's contention that this is a structure-formed interacting group element coupled in function of an arrangement the basis pathology thus determined. I.E., hallucination is an open system at a set point with pathology. Hence--within certain limits, of course--the equilibrium establishes an arrangement whose characteristics enable any observer to identify hallucination as such. Since the methodology is in accordance with the General System Theory, the elements involved are studied like functional parts within a system. In other words, neither determinism nor simple causation are resorted to. Since--according to the GST--there is a higher relevance among connected elements which is not to be found among independent ones, thus a functional description is of a higher relevance than a particular one. So, the structure is proposed as a functional arrangement.</dc:description>
