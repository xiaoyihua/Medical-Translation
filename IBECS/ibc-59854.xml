<dc:description xml:lang="es">Vagal paragangliomas are much less frequent than carotid and jugulo-tympanic paragangliomas and, like these other forms, can be sporadic or familial. The familial forms usually occur as isolated tumors or within syndromic entities such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIA-B, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1. The genes causing the disease are located in three loci: SDHD (11q23), SDHC (1q21) and SDHB (1p36.1p35). Approximately one-third of apparently sporadic paragangliomas also show germline SDH mutations. In familial forms, the rate of multicentric tumors is up to 30-40%. Vagal paragangliomas arise from arise from paraganglia associated with the vagus nerve. Lower cranial nerve deficits are frequently observed. An essential feature in the diagnosis of vagal paraganglioma is that they are situated behind the internal carotid artery. The treatment of vagal paraganglioma should be based on the biological behavior of the tumor, the age and health status of the patient, tumoral size andt he possible treatment-associated morbidity. Surgery is important in the treatment of vagal paraganglioma but this option is controversial in patients without lower cranial nerve palsy. The approach of choice is usually cervical or transcervical. If the tumor involves the jugular fossa, in addition to the cervical approach, a transpetrous approach is also required. Expectant management and radiotherapy are often valid options (AU)</dc:description>
