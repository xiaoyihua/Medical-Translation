<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The Colombian National Institute of Health has been studying the epidemiology of several respiratory viruses since 1997 to identify their circulation patterns and the role they play as pathogenic agents of acute and/or moderate respiratory infection (RI) in children aged less than 5. METHODS The study used sentinel surveillance methods in sentinel hospitals in Bogotá and Manizales. Four to eight nasopharyngeal samples were collected every week in the sentinel hospitals from children aged less than five consulting for low or high RI. Nasopharyngeal samples were processed by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS 1,743 children were examined from January 1997 to December 2003; 35 % were found to be positive for respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus was found more frequently while adenovirus was found in 47 patients (2,6 % of the sample; 1,4-2,5 % 95 %CI). Adenovirus was detected throughout the year (excepting January) but peaks occurred in March, July, October and December. Most patients were hospitalised (50-87%) and were in need of oxygen support. Fatality:case ratio was 7%; B7, 2, C1, and B3 serotypes were identified. CONCLUSION The data suggested that respiratory infection due to adenovirus was a low frequency event amongst the children seeking medical care at the sentinel hospitals. However, when respiratory disease was caused by adenovirus, it was severe.</dc:description>
