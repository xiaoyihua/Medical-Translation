The aim of this study is to assess the reliability, internal consistency and construct validity of the Spanish version of this questionnaire. METHODS After translation, back translation and assessment of content validity of the questionnaire, 200 questionnaires were distributed to medical doctors and nurses working in 15 primary health care centres located in 4 autonomous regions (Comunidad Valenciana, Castilla León, Murcia, Cantabria), in 2013. Cronbach's alpha, intraclass correlation and rho Spearman coefficients were calculated. RESULTS the Spanish version of PREMIS encompasses 64 items. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was greater than or close to 0.7 in most of indices. Intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.87 and Spearman coefficient of 0.67 showed a high reliability. All correlations for the scale of Opinions, which is the only one that was considered factorial structure of the questionnaire PREMIS, were higher than 0.30.
