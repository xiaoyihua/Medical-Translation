<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Nocturia is the main cause of insomnia or sleep interruption in adult men, which has a negative impact on daily activities, quality of life (QoL) and quality of sleep (QoS). The assessment of nocturia and its impact on QoL and QoS in patients suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has been poor in terms of clinical research, moreover there is a lack of specific methods to assess this impact. OBJECTIVES The objectives of BPH treatment should include the improvement of patient's QoL by controlling both diurnal and nocturnal symptoms. In order to assess how nocturia affects QoL and also QoS, some specific tools, such as N-QoL questionnaire or the number of Hours of Undisturbed Sleep (HUS), have been recently developed. Therefore, it would be interesting to assess how nocturia reduction due to LUTS/BPH treatment can impact on some objective parameters such as HUS and also how nocturia reduction improves QoS and QoL. This assessment should be developed during the application of pharmacological treatments in clinical practice by means of these specific tools. With the aim of tackling nocturia as an urologic problem in patients with LUTS/BPH, as well as knowing the physiology of sleep and the effect of nocturia on the sleep and QoL, a meeting of expert urologists, that gathered about fifty specialists of all around Spain, was held in Madrid. This article presents the main ideas and concepts exposed in this meeting. CONCLUSIONS Nocturia is a symptom with a high prevalence in older patients with STUI/BPH. The PreNoc study has showed a Nocturia prevalence in Spain of 83% in patients &gt; or =60 years old diagnosed of BPH. Nocturia is the most bothersome symptom in patients with STUI/BPH.</dc:description>
