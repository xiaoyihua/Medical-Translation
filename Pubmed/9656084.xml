<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Several diagnostic tools have been used in the evaluation of the severity transvalvular gradient and aortic valve area. The advances in cardiac catheterization and Doppler echocardiographic measure these items accurately. We designed a retrospective, observational open and transversal survey that included patients with severe aortic stenosis that required transseptal cardiac catheterization. Their echocardiographic and hemodynamic studies were reviewed. From January 1991 to December 1996 we studied 30 patient from a population of 256. All of them with severe aortic stenosis. There were 17 males and 13 females with an age range from 32 a 71 years. RESULTS the transvalvular gradient measured by catheterization vs. Doppler echocardiogram was 98.80 +/- 37.29 mmHg vs. 96.63 +/- 38.64 mmHg respectively P = 0.84. The valvular area measured by catheterization vs Doppler echocardiographic 0.63 +/- 0.17 cm2 vs 0.62 +/- 0.15 cm2 respectively P = 0.63. There was not difference in the gradients using these two methods. We conclude that patients with severe aortic stenosis could be referred to surgical procedure without the need of cardiac catheterization if no concurrent coronary disease is suspected.</dc:description>
