<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED To assess the efficacy of oxcarbazepine in the treatment of cocaine addiction and its influence on impulsivity and craving in cocaine addicts. METHODOLOGY A prospective, observational and clinical study was conducted in patients diagnosed with cocaine abuse/dependence (DSM IV criteria), monitoring supervised treatment with oxcarbazepine for 12 weeks. SAMPLE 30 patients (aged 18 or over) voluntarily undergoing treatment at an Addictive Behaviors Unit (UCA). Patients were selected randomly after providing explicit authorization and informed consent. RESULTS Abstinence rate increased, reaching 100% of participants that remained in compliance throughout the 12-week period (60% of those who started the treatment). Negative results in the urine test for cocaine detection also increased, reaching 90.9% of those in treatment at week 8. Treatment with oxcarbazepine was seen to produce a statistically significant reduction in craving and impulsivity after 4, 8 and 12 weeks, with respect to baseline measures at the start of treatment. The craving index correlates with reduction in cocaine use. CONCLUSIONS Oxcarbazepine is effective in reducing impulsivity and craving in relation to cocaine. Thus, we recommend high initial doses of oxcarbazepine in patients with high impulsivity prior to treatment.</dc:description>
