<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify knowledge, skills and attitudes among physicians and nurses of adults' intensive care units (ICUs), referred to advance directives or living wills. DESIGN A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out. SETTING Nine hospitals in the Community of Madrid (Spain). PARTICIPANTS Physicians and nurses of adults' intensive care. INTERVENTIONS A qualitative Likert-type scale and multiple response survey were made. VARIABLES Knowledge, skills and attitudes about the advance directives. A descriptive statistical analysis based on percentages was made, with application of the chi-squared test for comparisons, accepting p &lt; 0.05 as representing statistical significance. RESULTS A total of 331 surveys were collected (51%). It was seen that 90.3% did not know all the measures envisaged by the advance directives. In turn, 50.2% claimed that the living wills are not respected, and 82.8% believed advance directives to be a useful tool for health professionals in the decision making process. A total of 85.3% the physicians stated that they would respect a living will, in cases of emergencies, compared to 66.2% of the nursing staff (p = 0.007). Lastly, only 19.1% of the physicians and 2.3% of the nursing staff knew whether their patients had advance directives (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Although health professionals displayed poor knowledge of advance directives, they had a favorable attitude toward their usefulness. However, most did not know whether their patients had a living will, and some professionals even failed to respect such instructions despite knowledge of the existence of advance directives. Improvements in health professional education in this field are needed.</dc:description>
