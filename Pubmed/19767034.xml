<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The esophageal cancer (EC) is a slightly frequent but serious disease. Our aim is to describe the characteristics of the patients with EC in our Hospital. PATIENTS AND METHOD We included 200 patients consecutively diagnosed and/or treated for CE between between January, 2003 and December, 2007. The location of the tumor was analyzed, the histological type, the proofs realized for to establish the classification, the treatments, the survival and the morbi-mortality of the surgery. RESULTS The endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) modified the therapeutic strategy in 12% of the patients. The survival to the year, 3 years and 5 years was 48%, 25% and 21%, respectively. 74 (32%) patients were operated, 48 (65%) of them was treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The postsurgical mortality was 8% (6 patients) and the morbidity was 57% (114 patients). In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for traditional risk factors, were the location in the average third ( [HR, hazard ratio]=2.3; confidence interval [IC] of 95%, 1.3-4.1) and not accomplishment of surgery after the chemotherapy and radiotherapy (HR=1.9; IC to 95%, 1.15-3). CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis is realized very later. The EUS has contributed a better therapeutic strategy to our patients. The mortality continues being high.</dc:description>
