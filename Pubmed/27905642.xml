<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Social capital is an economical idea that refers to connections between individuals and entities that can be economically valuable. AIM To establish the relationship of social capital as a health care asset, with sociodemographic variables of older women attending public health care services. MATERIAL AND METHODS Chen&#146;s Personal Social Capital scale was applied to 113 women aged between 64 and 80 years during 2014. Cronbach&#146;s alpha of the instrument was calculated. RESULTS The Cronbach&#146;s alpha of the instrument was 0.86. The average score for social capital was 23.9 points of a maximum of 50. Bridging capital scores had the higher disparity, specifically in participation in community organizations and the representation of their interest in them. Bonding capital decreased along with a higher age of interviewed women (r = -0,43, p &lt; 0,01). Higher territorial roots were associated with a lower perception of social community resource availability (r = -0,42, p &lt; 0,01). CONCLUSIONS The social capital scores in these women were low. Their better support networks were close relationships and relatives. The sensation of solitude increased with age.</dc:description>
