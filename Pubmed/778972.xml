<dc:description xml:lang="en">A case of diabetes insipidus is presented which appeared in a 13 year old girl associated with hormone-resistant amenorrhea; she went through two normal pregnancies and partutition at 22 and 25, indicating a fertile amenorrhea. During a total of 17 years of observation the amenorrhea persisted, with the exception of a few normal menstruation periods at the beginning of the disease. She remained permanently under treatment with pitressin tannate. Repeated administrations of estrogens, gestagens and chorionic gonadotrophin, had no effect. An endometrial biopsy revealed a presecretory phase. Acidophilic index in vaginal smears as well as serial determinations of urinary pregnanodiol indicated cyclic changes. Daily determinations of urinary pregnanodiol indicated cyclic changes. Daily determinations of plasma gonadotrophins during 28 days revealed normal levels, with normal FSH pulse and ovulatory type peak of LH. An LH-RH test gave marked and characteristic increase of both hormones. The data indicate the integrity of the hypothalamo-hypophyso-ovaric system, with cyclic changes and formation of corpus luteum, vaginal trophism and endometrial changes, concordant with the two normal pregnancies. In this case, the amenorrhea can only be explained by alteration of the usual endometrial vascular changes. The coexistence of diabetes insipidus and fertile amenorrhea is discused in relation with the possible participation of vasopressin in the mechanism of menstruation.</dc:description>
