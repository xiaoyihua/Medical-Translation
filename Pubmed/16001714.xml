<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The registry intends to establish the clinical characteristics, identify therapeutic approaches and describe in-hospital outcome of patients with acute coronary syndromes in Mexico. METHODS AND RESULTS RENASICA II is a prospective registry that included 8,098 patients with final diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes. Three thousand five hundred and forty three patients had unstable angina or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) and 4,555 ST elevation myocardial infarction. (STEMI) On admission typical chest pain was identified in 78% and 85% respectively. Non-ST elevation high risk group was identified in 36%. In STEMI group anterior myocardial infarction and Killip class I had a higher occurrence. The use of aspirin, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, nitrates, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors for patients with UA/NSTEMI were 90%, 50%, 45%, 58%, 50% and 54% respectively, with corresponding rates of 88%, 54%, 44%, 66%, 51% and 64% for STEMI patients. Coronary angiography, angioplasty and coronary bypass surgery were performed in 62%, 30% and 8% in UA/NSTEMI patients respectively with corresponding rates of 44%, 27% and 4% for the STEMI group. Among patients with STEMI 37% were under fibrinolytic therapy and 15% received primary or facilitated angioplasty. Overall In-hospital mortality was 7%, 4% UA/NSTEMI and 10% STEMI 10%. CONCLUSION The largest registry ACS in Latin-America provides important and reliable information on the complete spectrum, outcome, quality of care, and identifies areas for further improvement of the quality of our cardiovascular care. RENASICA II broadens our knowledge about how reperfusion and antithrombotic approaches modify the outcome and what needs to be improved in the real practice in Mexico.</dc:description>
