<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Data availability on nutrition status from vulnerable population groups is essential for the design and evaluation of interventions. The Ministry of Health from Argentina developed in 2004-2005 the National Survey of Nutrition and Health. Our objective is to describe the nutrition status of infants and preschool children (6-72 months), globally and by region and socioeconomic level. POPULATION AND METHODS A probabilistic, multistage sample was selected, representative at the national, regional and provincial levels. Anthropometric indices weight/age, height/age and weight/height, were estimated, according to WHO reference. Nutrient intake was estimated by a 24-hours recall, and hemoglobin, serum ferritin, retinol and vitamin D concentration were measured. RESULTS Prevalence of stunting, wasting and obesity were 8.0%, 1.3%, and 10.4%, respectively. Prevalence of anemia was 16.5% in children &lt;6 years and 35.3% in children aged 6-23 months. Prevalence of subclinical vitamin A deficiency in children of 2-5 years was 14.3%, and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Patagonia was 2.8% in children aged 6-23 months. Different nutrient intake inadequacies were observed. Infants and children at the lower socioeconomic level showed higher prevalence of nutrition inadequacies. CONCLUSIONS The coexistence of different nutrition deficiencies and overweight and obesity constitute the main characteristic of Argentinean infants and preschool children. Relevant differences exist according to socio-economic and geographic conditions.</dc:description>
