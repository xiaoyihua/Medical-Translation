<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective Improve the performance of the regionalization policy in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina, as a strategy to improve perinatal health care by analyzing implementation processes and building consensus among decision makers and stakeholders around an action plan. Methods Implementation research was conducted using mixed methodology. A needs assessment established tracer indicators to measure adherence to the components of the policy. Actors were studied to identify the barriers and facilitators of implementation. Training was provided on the development of consensus- and evidence-based policies, through workshops in which policy briefs were prepared and through a deliberative dialogue. Results There were improvements in the number of births in appropriate hospitals and in the number of births in maternity hospitals with Essential Obstetric and Neonatal Care (CONE). Barriers were identified in the referral systems and in communication on policy, which resulted in an initial agreement on the need for guidelines and specific technical training on the transfer of babies and mothers. Conclusions The participation of health workers in identifying barriers and strategies to overcome them, and the use of tools to report this to management, permit the adoption of consensus- and evidence-based strategies to improve policy implementation.</dc:description>
