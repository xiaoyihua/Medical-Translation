<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is a reduction of the size of the cerebellum and pons secondary to an alteration in its development, and can be caused by neurodegenerative diseases of genetic origin, of which there are known 10 subtypes (PCH 1-10), cortical malformations, metabolic and genetic diseases. OBJECTIVE To present the case of a child with microcephaly, PCH and West syndrome, in which the genetic study allowed to make the diagnosis of a deletion on chromosome X. CASE REPORT This is a female infant of 7-month at diagnosis, without family or obstetric history of interest, head circumference at birth -1.5 standard deviations (SD). She had little weight and growth in head circumference progression. In addition, physical examination revealed no fixating gaze, hypotonia with preserved deep tendon reflexes. Progressively developed refractary seizures. Brainsteam Auditory Evoked Potential demonstrated involvement of pontomesencefphalic ways and neuroimaging Pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The genetic study (aCGH) showed heterozygous deletion on the X chromosome, affecting the CASK gene. CONCLUSIONS Given the wide differential diagnosis proposed at the PCH, new cytogenetic techniques have improved the classification of HPC and in some cases establish their etiology, so in these cases can provide appropriate genetic counseling to families.</dc:description>
