<dc:description xml:lang="en">Diagnosis of a chronic disease in children implies a series of major changes in their daily lives and in the family dynamics. Due to the symptoms, treatment and limitations imposed by IBD, the particular features of this disease may negatively affect the psychosocial development of pediatric patients at a time when their personalities are being formed, as well as the development of autonomy and the beginning of affective relationships. In the last few years, several studies have paid special attention to quality of life and mental health both in affected children and in their close family environment. The comprehensive care of pediatric patients with IBD should include the child's psychosocial domain and should also provide the resources necessary for satisfactory acceptance of and adaptation to the disease in children and their families.</dc:description>
