<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Shingles is the cutaneous expression of the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus infection in sensory ganglia. It presents as vesicles in the corresponding dermatome. The condition is called disseminated herpes zoster (DHZ) when more than 2 contiguous dermatomes are affected, more than 20 vesicles are observed outside the initial dermatome, or involvement is systemic. DHZ is rare and most frequently occurs in immunocompromised patients. OBJECTIVES To describe the epidemiology, predisposing factors, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and clinical course of patients with DHZ, and to compare the findings in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. METHODOLOGY We analyzed a retrospective case series of adults hospitalized between February 2010 and October 2015. RESULTS Forty-one patients with virologically confirmed manifestations of DHZ were included. Stress as a trigger factor was detected in 39% and immunodepression in 58.5%. Immunocompromised patients were younger than the immunocompetent patients (mean ages, 60.5 vs 82 years, P&lt;.01). The 8 immunocompetent patients with no detectable trigger factors were older (mean age, 85 years). In 95% of cases, DHZ was initially limited to a single dermatome and then spread to other dermatomes or became disseminated. Thrombocytopenia was detected in 56% of cases. Complication rates were similar in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients (54% vs 59%, P&gt;.01). Six patients died; there was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION This study provides evidence on the relationship between DHZ, the presence of underlying immunodepression, and complications. Immunosenescence may play an important role in the onset of this disease in older immunocompetent patients.</dc:description>
