<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Neuromuscular blockers (NMBs) have traditionally been thought to increase the risk of respiratory complications, although drawing conclusions in this respect would require complex studies in large patient samples. The aim of this study was to analyze data from the ARISCAT study to obtain an overall picture of how NMBs are being used and blocks are reversed in Catalonia, Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS NMB use as reflected in data from the ARISCAT study was analyzed. Case information from the database was organized into 4 groups: for patients not receiving a NMB (No-NMB), patients whose NMB block was performed with succinylcholine alone (SC), patients who received a single dose of a nondepolarizing NMB (SD-NMB), and patients who received additional doses of a nondepolarizing NMB or a continuous perfusion (AD-NMB). We analyzed patient characteristics, clinical and surgical characteristics, and complications during and after surgery in each of the groups. Variables were also analyzed according to whether the NMB effect had to be reversed. RESULTS Of the 2991 patients included in the ARISCAT study, 1545 received general or combined anesthesia. Of the 1545 patients, 1267 (89%) received a NMB and the block was reversed with an anticholinesterase agent in 54%. The group distribution was as follows: No-NMB, 103 patients; SC, 31; SD-NMB, 527; and AD-NMB, 709. The highest rate of comorbidity, longest duration of surgery, highest rate of complications during and after surgery, and the longest hospital stays were observed in the last of the 4 groups (AD-NMB). Reversion was required significantly more often after cardiothoracic and upper abdominal surgical procedures; the complication rates after those 2 types of surgery were statistically similar. CONCLUSIONS Nondepolarizing NMBs are used in combination with general anesthesia often in Catalonia; their use is associated with duration and type of surgery. A reversal drug is administered relatively more often in Catalonia than in other geographic areas.</dc:description>
