<dc:description xml:lang="en">BASIS Anisakiasis is an emerging parasitosis in our environment, although still scarcely known, mainly its gastrointestinal manifestations. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this paper 42 cases of anisakiasis with gastrointestinal symptoms (with or without cutaneous allergic manifestations) are described; all cases were studied in our hospital between 1995 and May 2004. RESULTS Thirty seven cases showed a gastric or gastroallergic form (6 confirmed with gastroscopy) and 5 suffered intestinal symptoms. In those in which endoscopy was not carried out, the diagnosis was done after clinical and biological findings. All patients were sensitized in the presence of Anisakis simplex. The 69% (29 cases) described raw anchovies ingestion or anchovies seasoned in vinegar ingestion some hours before the beginning of the clinical picture. The 59% showed allergic symptoms (gastroallergic anisakiasis); no patient with intestinal affectation showed allergic symptoms. Nausea (67%), vomiting (51%), and epigastralgia (50%) were the dominant symptoms in the group with gastric or gastroallergic anisakiasis without endoscopic confirmation; on the other hand, pain in right ileac fossa was the dominant symptom in the intestinal form. Fever was seen in two of the later patients (40%), but in no patient with gastric or gastroallergic anisakiasis. CONCLUSIONS Gastrointestinal symptomatology after ingestion of fish suspiciously prepared should suggest anisakiasis, regardless if clinical picture includes allergic manifestations. In our study, pain in right ileac fossa, fever, and absence of allergic manifestations were typical of intestinal form.</dc:description>
