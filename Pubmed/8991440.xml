<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and antibiotic sensitivity of Neisseria gonorrhoeae versus penicillin, tetracycline, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone and spectinomycin from 1988 to 1994 in the province of Soria (Spain). METHODS From January 1988 to December 1994, clinical samples of 57 strains of N. gonorrhoeae were isolated. Auxotype, serotype, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) studies were performed versus 5 antimicrobials and analysis of plasmids in the penicillinase producer strains (PPNG), was carried out in the Bacteriology Department of the Instituto Carlos III in Madrid (Spain). RESULTS The rate of incidence of the isolation of N. gonorrhoeae was similar from 1988 to 1990 (11.7 to 19.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) and decreased from 1991 to 1994 (6.4 to 0 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). The strains belonged to 30 different auxotypes/serotypes indicating a great heterogeneity among them. The proportion of penicillinase producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG) increased over the study period. The first strains with high resistance to tetracycline (TRNG) were first isolated in the authors' area in 1991 and the proportion increased up to the end of the study. All the strains were sensitive to ceftriaxone, cefoxitin and spectinomycin. CONCLUSIONS A decrease was observed in the rate of incidence of N. gonorrhoeae since 1991 with an increase in the proportion of NGPP and TRNG strains. Ceftriaxone and spectinomycin present good activity versus all the strains studied with their empiric use as treatment being possible in the province of Soria (Spain).</dc:description>
