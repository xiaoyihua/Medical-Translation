<dc:description xml:lang="en">An in-depth review is presented of the role that cognitive reserve plays in the emergence of (mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and its progression to dementia by using different indicators. The studies reviewed provide support to the hypothesis that the reserve influences the manifestation of symptoms of cognitive impairment and at least partially, in its progression to dementia. The role of indicators of reserve are discussed, such as educational level, work complexity and cognitive activity in these processes. A model is also presented that argues that people with MCI and low reserves show a steeper decline early in the process of deterioration, compared to the high level of reserve this marked deterioration would have at the end of the process, due to the protective role of this reserve. This raises the need for more empirical research to help consolidate this theoretical model.</dc:description>
