<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Following a line of work we studied 1,140 acute poisoning (AP) attended at the Internal Medicine Emergency Department at 12 de Octubre Hospital, Madrid, in 1997. The incidence increased up to 157/100,000 inhabitants. Mean age was 36 years (SD: 15 y), median, 32 years. Self-inflicted AP: 1,052 cases (92%); the suicide attempt was the most common type (509, 48%). Among males, the alcoholic intoxication (332, 59%) predominated. Among accidental AP (88 cases), 90% occurred at home. Poisons: drugs. Drugs were used for 78% of suicide attempts. The relative incidence of benzodiazepines increased (47%) and that of antidepressive drugs decreased (11%). A remarkable increase in the "other drugs" group was noted, as well as the association of drugs and non-drugs (10%). Alcohol use increased significantly (249 cases more than in 1994), as well as drugs although to a lesser extent, breaking the trend observed in the last few years. Cocaine is now the most common (among women heroin is still the leading cause); 5 AP were caused by synthesis drugs (extasis, MDMA) and an increase was observed with "other drugs". ANTECEDENTS suicide attempts: depression (30%) and previous attempts (19%); ethylism: alcoholism (40%); AP with other drugs: drug abuse (52%). Admitted to ICU: 1.4%. The mortality rate decreased to 0.08%.</dc:description>
