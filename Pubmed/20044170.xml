<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION According to current classifications, the metabolite of greatest clinical interest to evaluate vitamin D(3) dosage is 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) with a reference interval of approximately 10-70ng/ml, although many authors consider values of approximately 40ng/ml or 100nmol/l to be desirable. According to these definitions, three out of four people in Spain would have vitamin D(3) deficiency. MATERIAL AND METHOD The RIA-CT technique was used for diagnosis of 25(OH)D(3) to determine the population status. Subsequently, a case-control study was performed to evaluate the relationship between distinct diseases and vitamin D(3) deficiency. RESULTS A total of 73.2% of the cases were found to be within the range considered acceptable, according to the present classification. One hundred percent of the control group and healthy menopausal women who did not receive any kind of vitamin supplement had levels of 40 ng/ml or more. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that the prior situation of a high prevalence of vitamin D(3) deficiency has improved and that levels are now acceptable in 26.8% of the population, with a mean value of 46.2 ng/ml, considering 10-70 ng/ml as the reference range.</dc:description>
