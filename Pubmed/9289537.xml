<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Familial combined hyperlipidemia is the commonest genetic form of hyperlipidemia among survivors of myocardial infarction and, therefore, its early detection is crucial for the prevention of coronary artery disease. The aim of the study was to establish the prevalence of hyperlipidemia in the offspring of affected families and to characterize their lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein profile. PATIENT AND METHODS Forty five subjects below the age of 19 were studied from which 30 were from affected families and 15 from healthy control families. Cholesterol and triglycerides in plasma, VLDL, IDL, LDL and HDL as well as apolipoproteins AI, B, C-II and C-III were measured. RESULTS Hyperlipidemia was detected in 13 children (43%) from affected families. They also presented significantly elevated concentrations of cholesterol in plasma (p &lt; 0.0001), LDL (p &lt; 0.0001) and HDL (p &lt; 0.05); triglycerides in plasma (p &lt; 0.007), VLDL (p &lt; 0.05) and LDL (p &lt; 0.008), together with significantly increased concentrations of apolipoproteins AI (p &lt; 0.02), B (p &lt; 0.0004), C-II (p &lt; 0.0005) and C-III (p &lt; 0.03). No changes were observed in the IDL fraction. CONCLUSIONS There is an elevated prevalence of hyperlipidemia among the offspring of patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia. On the contrary to that observed in adults, no alterations of the IDL fraction are present among affected children.</dc:description>
