<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Gender is a structural health determinant. This study analyses the changes in gender development inequalities in Spain and its regions (1980-2005). METHODS Ecological study of the evolution of Gender Development Index and its components (Education, Income, Life Expectancy at Birth) by sex in Spain and its regions (1980-2005). Information Source: Gender Development Index (1980-2005) from the Human Capital Report, plus construction ad hoc of the Gender Development Index 2005 following the same methodology of Human Capital Report. INFORMATION SOURCES National Statistics Institute, Active Population Survey, Municipal Register, Ministry of Education, Universities Council, EUROSTAT, and Wage Structure Survey. RESULTS Spanish Gender Development Index 2005:0,903 and 1980:0,810. The range between regions under Spanish Gender Development Index was 3 times higher in 1980 (DifferenceC.Valenciana-Extremadura:0,068) than in 2005 (DifferenceAsturias-Extremadura:0,023). The regions above the Spanish Gender Development Index did not vary much. The three components (Education, Income, Life Expectancy at Birth) of the Gender Development Index improved from 1980 to 2005. The Spanish Education Index of men was higher than this value in women until 1985; later this index becomes higher in women than in men. The Spanish Income Index of women in 2005 (0,814) is inferior to that of men 25 years before (1980:0,867). CONCLUSIONS Despite the improvement of the gender development happened in Spain between 1980 and 2005, the inter-regional inequalities between north-south persist. In 2005, women have more education level than men. However, the Spanish income media in women in 2005 are inferior to the media of the men in 1980.</dc:description>
