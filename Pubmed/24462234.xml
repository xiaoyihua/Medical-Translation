<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To explore the relationship between the severity of urinary urge incontinence (UUI) on healthcare resources utilization (HRU) and loss of labor productivity of subjects with overactive bladder (OAB) in the general population in Spain. METHODS Secondary analysis of a cross-sectional web-based study conducted in the general population &gt;18 years, through a battery of HRU questions asked using an online method. Probable OAB subjects were identified using a previously validated algorithm and a score &gt;8 in the OAB-V8 questionnaire. HRU questions included an assessment of concomitant medication used as a consequence of OAB/UUI, pad utilization, and medical office visits. Patients were grouped according to the number of UUI episodes into 0, 1, 2-3 or 4+ episodes. RESULTS Of a total of 2,035 subjects participating from the general population, 396 patients [52.5% women, mean age: 55.3 (11.1) years, OAB-V8 mean score: 14.5 (7.9)] were analyzed; 203 (51.3%) with 0 episodes, 119 (30.1%) with 1, 52 (13.1%) with 2 or 3, and 22 (5.6%) with 4 or more episodes. A linear and significant adjusted association was observed between the number of UUI episodes and HRU; the higher the number of daily episodes the higher the HRU. Subjects with more episodes had medical visits more frequently at the primary care (P = .001) and specialist (P = .009) level as well. Consumption of day (P &lt; .001) and night (P &lt; .001) urinary absorbents, anxiolytic medicines (P = .021) and antibiotics (P = .05) was higher in patients with more UUI episodes. CONCLUSION The severity of OAB in terms of frequency of daily urge incontinence episodes was significantly and linearly associated with higher healthcare resources utilization and a decrease in labor productivity in subjects with probable OAB in Spain.</dc:description>
