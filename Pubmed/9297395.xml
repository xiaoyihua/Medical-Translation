<dc:description xml:lang="en">PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 137 children less than 14 years of age were studied for caustic ingestion in the period 1987-1994. Seventy-five percent of the children affected were less than 3 years old. All ingestions but one, were accidental. The incidence rate of caustic ingestion did not decrease significantly during the period studied. RESULTS Early esophagogastroscopy was the method of choice for the classification of caustic burns. Esophago-gastric damage occurred in 62 cases (45.3%), and was most frequently related to strong bases included in cleaners used in industry. Ingestion of household cleaners is associated with a good prognosis. The development of esophageal stricture was closely related to the severity of the initial injury. This occurred in 24 patients (17.5%). Prolonged hospital stay was necessary in order to treat adequately these patients. This means an elevated cost, estimated at 1,036,496 pesetas per patient, to the Health Care System. CONCLUSIONS To minimize the frequency of this kind of childhood accident, an information campaign directed especially to parents is recommended. Furthermore, strict control concerning the commercialization and storage of these products is mandatory.</dc:description>
