<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Lung sequestration is a pathologically isolated pulmonary parenchyma, with its own arterial vascularisation. AIMS A descriptive-retrospective study of patients of the La Princesa University Hospital, Madrid. MATERIAL AND METHODS The characteristics of patients admitted to the La Princesa University Hospital Thoracic Surgery Unit during 1996-2008, were analysed. RESULTS Of the 500 patients, 8 had histopathology confirmation, of which 5 were women. There was respiratory infection in 7 patients, with 4 in the lower right lobe. The intralobar variant was diagnosed in 7 patients. The systemic vascularisation came from the thoracic aorta in five cases. A standard posterolateral thoracotomy with lobectomy was performed in 5 patients. There was no morbidity or mortality. It was more common in women, in lower lobes and similar in both hemithorax; 3. The most common clinical symptom was the respiratory infection; 4. The diagnosis was made with imaging tests.</dc:description>
