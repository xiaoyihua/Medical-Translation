<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE Identify risk factors associated to violent behavior among adolescent students. METHODS A survey was conducted using a two-staged stratified cluster sampling design. It represents all junior and high school students of Puerto Rico. Students from 117 schools were administered an anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS Alcohol use was reported by 78.7% of students, and 14% reported illegal drug use. About 25% committed one violent act during the previous year, and 22% committed two acts or more. Drug use, alcohol use, not getting along with their parents, being a male, school failure and drug use by siblings were identified as risk factors for violent behavior. Church attendance was identified as a protective factor. DISCUSSION Primary physicians can play an important role in violence prevention through early identification of family violence.</dc:description>
