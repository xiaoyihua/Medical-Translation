<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND This review summarizes the different species of dermatophytes isolates in our laboratory between 1991 and 1995. We describe the clinical forms and establish the distribution over this period of time. METHODS Retrospective survey of samples from outpatients of the Dermatology Service in Miguel Servet Hospital where mycologic cultures are required. The extraction of samples is made by scrapes with a carpet or scalpel and they are cultured on Saboureaud agar with chloramphenicol and dermatophytes agar for 3 weeks. All plates were incubated at 28 degrees C. The identification of isolated strains is made by means of morphologic and physiologic criteria; the doubtful strains were identified in national referral center of Majadahonda CNMVISS. RESULTS 4004 samples were analyzed from 3934 patients and 543 strains of dermatophytes were isolated. The frequencies were as follow: Microsporum canis (44%), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (31.4%), Trichophyton rubrum (18.6%), Epidermophyton floccosum (2.6%), Microsporum gypseum (1.4%), Trichophyton tonsurans (0.7%), Trichophyton verrucosum (0.7%), Trichophyton violaceum (0.2%) y Microsporum audouinii (0.2%). The most frequently observed dermatophytoses were Tinea corporis (54.8%), followed by Tinea unguium (12.6%), Tinea capitis (12.5%), Tinea pedis (8.3%), Tinea manuum (6.3%), Tinea cruris (4.7%) and Tinea barbae (0.7%). CONCLUSIONS The zoophylic species are the most prevalent in our area and we have observed a raise of Microsporum canis in recent years. It is important to perform mycologic survey in every suspected lesion in older to determinate the true incidence of human dermatophytoses.</dc:description>
