<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report a retrospective review of primary peptic ulcer peptic disease in 61 children. The follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 6 years. All cases were confirmed by endoscopic examination and related with radiological studies result. The number of ulcer peptic disease detected increased as much as the number of endoscopies were performed annually. In the last 20 patients pinch biopsies from antrum were taken looking for Campylobacter pylori, encountering 10 positives. The relation male:female were 2:1. Gastrointestinal bleeding had occurred in children below 6 years and abdominal pain was seen in older children. All of patients who had C. pylory infection had had recurrent abdominal pain. Three peptic ulcer were documented in patients with cystic fibrosis, which had the worse response to medical treatment. Others, had a satisfactory response.</dc:description>
