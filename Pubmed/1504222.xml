<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify differences in mortality between communities in function of certain socio-economic factors. Firstly, between the urban and rural population of Navarra; and secondly, among different neighbourhoods in Pamplona categorised according to their socioeconomic status. DESIGN Descriptive study. As the instrument of comparison, the standard mortality rates (SMR) have been used with the direct method. The relationship between mortality and socio-economic status in the neighbourhoods of Pamplona has been analysed by means of lineal regression. SITE. Institute of Public Health of Navarra. PATIENTS OR OTHERS PARTICIPANTS Those people recorded on the Municipal Censuses of Navarra in 1986, who were between 25 and 74 years old. 8,086 of these died during our period of study, which covered the five years between 1985 and 1989. MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS The SMRs for all causes in men (741 x 10(6)) and women (324 x 10(6)) who live in rural communities are significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than those in urban communities (863 and 390). The specific cause of death which marks the most difference between the two types of community are tumours (p less than 0.05). In the capital (Pamplona), masculine mortality was found to increase in line with the socio-economic status of the neighbourhood lived in (p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS There is greater mortality in urban than in rural communities; and in neighbourhoods with low socio-economic status as against those with a high status. However, in this second case, the greater mortality only applies to men.</dc:description>
