<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of Chlamydia, Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma in patients with peritoneal tubal factor infertility and altered. MATERIAL AND METHODS A descriptive, observational, retrospec- tive, transversal, infertility patients Juarez Hospital of Mexico 2013 to 2015. Study included patients with infertility diagnosis and detection of antibodies (IgG) by ELISA for Chlamydia and vaginal cultures for Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma, hysterosalpingography and histerolapa- roscopia with chromotubation RESULTS 46 patients with a mean age of 32.5 years. It was found that 36% were positive for these infections (n = 17): Chlamydia in 8.7% (n = 4), Ureaplasma in 21.7% (n = 10) and Mycoplasma in 6.5% (n = 3). Chlamydia patients and bilateral tubal occlusion (OTB) in 5.8% (n = 1), Ureaplasma and OTB (n = 5) were identified in 29.4% of them with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and tubal obstruction Ureaplasma right (OTD) in 5.8% (n = 1), Ureaplasma and tubal patency but with loose adhesions in 5.8% (n = 1) and Mycoplasma with OTB in 11.1% (n = 2), p = 0.425. Hysterosalpingography showed a sensitivity of 59% and specificity of 79%. CONCLUSIONS Although there was no association of variables, Ureaplasma infection was more common in patients with infertility and tubal damage.</dc:description>
