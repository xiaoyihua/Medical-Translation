<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Obesity constitutes a severe public health problem due to both its complications as a morbid entity and its association to different chronic diseases. The aim of the present study was to calculate the prevalence of obesity in the Spanish adult population. METHODS With the information concerning weight and height of a representative population sample of Spanish adults over the age of 20 obtained from the computerized data base of the National Survey of Spanish Public Health, Quetelet's index was calculated as an estimation of obesity. RESULTS 7.8% of the Spanish adult population may be considered as obese. Obesity is more frequent in individuals from 55 to 64 years of age, in females and in those with a lower education. CONCLUSIONS From estimations performed from self declared data concerning weight and height, obesity was found to be more frequent in the population from 45 to 74 years of age, in females and in those of low socioeconomic levels.</dc:description>
