<dc:description xml:lang="en">Distinctive features of patients over 70 years with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are studied. Between May 1988 and April 1989, 420 patients with AMI were admitted to our hospital; 118 of them (28.5%) were older than 70 years. In this group of patients, proportion of woman was higher (36 vs 16%, p less than 0.001), while incidence of smoking and hypercholesterolemia was lower (41 vs 64%, p less than 0.001; and 15 vs 29%, p less than 0.05). There was no differences in other risk factors, prior history of coronary heart disease (angina, AMI, coronary surgery), or general features of AMI (location, proportion of painless AMI, non-Q-wave AMI, evolved AMI, initial admission to coronary care unit or general ward, time from the beginning of symptoms to admission, residual ejection fraction). The incidence of severe complications was superior between older patients: shock, 17 vs 7% (p less than 0.05); Killip class III/IV, 30 vs 13% (p less than 0.001); and fascicular blocks: 26 vs 16% (p less than 0.05). Hospital mortality was also higher in older patients, 25.5 vs 14% (p less than 0.01). No patients older than 70 years received fibrinolytic therapy, and only one underwent coronary artery surgery (22% and 15%, respectively, in younger patients). Coronary arteriography, exercise test, radionuclide ventriculography and Holter monitoring were also performed before discharge in a lesser proportion in older patients. We conclude that mortality and severe complications were higher between patients over 70 years with AMI. We think that mortality could be decreased by a more aggressive management in, at least, selected groups of older patients with AMI.</dc:description>
