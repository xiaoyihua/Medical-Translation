<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The findings of the 2010 Spanish Catheter Ablation Registry are presented. METHODS Data were collected in two ways: retrospectively using a standardized questionnaire, and prospectively from a central database. Each participating center selected its own preferred method of data collection. RESULTS Fifty-seven Spanish centers voluntarily contributed data to the survey. A total of 8762 ablation procedures was analyzed, averaging 154 (97) per center. The 3 main conditions treated were atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (n=2321; 27%), typical atrial flutter (n=1839; 22%), and accessory pathways (n=1738; 20%). Atrial fibrillation was the fourth most common condition treated (n=1309; 15%), and reflects mild growth. The overall success rate was 94%, major complications occurred in 1.7%, and the overall mortality rate was 0.06%. CONCLUSIONS Data from the 2010 registry show that the number of ablations carried out continued to increase and exceeded 8700 ablations for the second time. In addition, they show, in general, a higher success rate and a lower number of complications. Again, cavotricuspid isthmus ablation for typical atrial flutter was the second most common condition treated. The number of catheter ablations carried out for ventricular arrhythmias in Spain is growing compared to the previous year.</dc:description>
