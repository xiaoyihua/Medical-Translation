<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim was to study the reliability of the available data, stemming from the concordance between two different observers' measurement of the level of free residual chlorine. DESIGN An observational, crossover study, using measurements of the level of free residual chlorine repeated on the same day by two different observers. SETTING Health Area of Albacete. PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS 176 double measurements of chlorine, carried out during the study period in 69 networks distributing different waters. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Concordance between observers on the absence or presence of chlorination was low (I.Kappa = 0.261), showing a bias in favour of the presence of chlorination in the measurements made by local technicians (McNemar p &lt; 0.01). Applying a logistic regression model, it was observed that the risk of disagreement was as much as 8.5 times greater when chlorine measurement required the local technician to travel. CONCLUSIONS We concluded that the data available was of questionable value and that it would be useful to put forward some new proposals to improve the supervision of the network.</dc:description>
