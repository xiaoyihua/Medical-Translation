<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND This study is based on the inadequate quality of care and respect for rights in mental health services and on differences in perceptions on these issues between users, families and staff in other countries. OBJECTIVES To compare the perceptions of quality and respect of rights between users, families and staff in Chile. METHODS In 15 randomized specialized outpatient facilities, 146 users, 64 families and 148 staff were interviewed applying the WHO QualityRights instrument. The interviews with users and families were conducted by a user and the interviews with staff were conducted by a mental health professional, both interviewers were external to the 15 centers and trained in the use of the instrument. RESULTS Total scores for the set of 18 indicators studied show lower values among users and families compared with staff (p &lt;0.001). In three of the four areas studied significant differences were observed, with users and relatives also perceiving a lower percentage of compliance with standards than did the staff. The area of rights to inclusion in the community was the one with the greatest difference among the three groups interviewed, with the 4 standards having significantly lower scores on users and their families CONCLUSIONS The results of this study contribute to highlight the importance of mental health services really listening the voice of users and their families, in order to understand their needs and expectations about care. The need for users to actively participate in treatment decisions and implementing community interventions to promote greater social inclusion are also concluded.</dc:description>
