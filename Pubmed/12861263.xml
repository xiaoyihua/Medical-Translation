<dc:description xml:lang="en">Chronic functional constipation is a problem whose frequency in consultation is increasing at adolescent ages, in spite of the family's lack of knowledge of the intestinal habits of their children in these age groups. It normally results in a high number of different complementary tests, the use of medicines, at times in a continuous way, hospital admissions and high costs. It is essential to make a detailed clinical history (in order to look for the underlying causes that produce constipation), to realise an exhaustive physical examination in search of any sign of associated pathology, and to apply effective and satisfactory therapeutic actions. Preventive measures must be a priority; hence educational norms, dietetic norms--while the problem persists--and apprenticeship in health self-care are included. Pharmacological treatment should never be the definitive solution to constipation, nor should it be used in a continuous way.</dc:description>
