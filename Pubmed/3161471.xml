<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report the laboratory findings from studies carried out on 37 pheochromocytoma patients; (20 males and 17 females whose age ranged from 11 to 55 years). Among the parameters measured, fasting hyperglycemia was one of the alterations most frequently encountered (59%), the difference with the normal values was highly significant (p less than 0.001). The levels found for the other parameters measured were also elevated in some cases and the difference between them and the normal values was statistically significant, the assays included were serum cholesterol and creatinine, haemoglobin, hematocrit and white blood cell and platelet counts. The response to the oral glucose load was normal in 9 patients, 6 showed a diabetic curve and 2 had a glucose intolerance response. Data from our observations and from the literature shows that these alterations may be a source of erroneous diagnosis, mainly in cases where symptoms are atypical or infrequent such as fever of unknown etiology, shock and others. Therefore recognizing these abnormalities as a sign of pheochromocytoma is very important both from the diagnostic and therapeutic points of view.</dc:description>
