<dc:description xml:lang="en">Both socioeconomic and cultural characteristics of families were studied as conditioning factors of malnutrition in 63 infants born at term. The sample studied included 45 infants, small for their gestational age (SGA) as experimental group, and 18 infants with adequate weight for gestational age (AGA), as the control group. These infants were studied during their third year of age, and significant differences between both groups were found in the following parameters: size, social personality, parasitic infestation and duration of lactation. A correlation between socioeconomic and cultural level, and incidence of malnutrition in infancy is postulated.</dc:description>
