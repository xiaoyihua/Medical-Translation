<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Epidemiologically characterizing breast cancer in the Arica and Parinacota region in Chile and its evolution during 1997-2007. METHOD A descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed. All clinical histories for 306 cases of breast cancer were reviewed. All patients were detected through the Arica Juan Noé Crevani Hospital's Oncological Mammary Polyclinic from 1997 to 2007. A descriptive data analysis was made, followed by a tendency analysis. RESULTS 51.3 % of the 306 cases studied were aged 46 to 65 years, 13.9 % being of Aymara ethnic origin. 70.2 % of the women involved in the study were climacteric, 98.4 % being without hormonal treatment. 12 % referred to having a family background of cancer, the sister being the most frequently referred to relative. 84.1 % had a histological diagnosis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma, stage IIA being the most frequently occurring one (32.8 %). 31.6 % presented multiple metastases, 74.7 % of this group being aged 56 to 94. Time series analysis indicated an increasing incidence rate and decreasing mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS The Arica and Parinacota region of Chile presented an increasing tendency for new cases of breast cancer during the period being studied which was concentrated during the early stages of evolution. These findings could be explained by the early detection of breast cancer and the implementation of public health policy.</dc:description>
