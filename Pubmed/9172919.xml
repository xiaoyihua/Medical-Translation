<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION HTLV-I is a human retrovirus which has been implicated in the genesis of tropical spastic paraparesis (HTLV-I-associated myelopathy). So far five cases of this illness have been detected in Spain, five of them in immigrants. We present a new case in Spain, with a characteristic chronic clinical picture. CASE REPORT A 36-year-old black woman native of Ecuatorial Guinea, developed along 10 years a progressive paraparesis of asymmetric onset with important back pain, that arrives to paraplegic spastic phase at the present time. She presents distal amyotrophies, ulcers of decubitus and loss of control of sphincters, with normal mental status. Laboratory tests: blood, biochemistry and microbiologic studies: normal, or negative. She presented positive Western Blot serology for HTLV-I, confirmed by means of PCR technique. Cranial MRI: small and hyperintense subcortical lesions on T2 weighted images; spinal MRI: local atrophy at high thoracic level. A lumbar puncture was performed, with no cells, and with presence of oligoclonal bands, and a high IgG index. Urodynamic study: neurogenic spastic bladder. EMG: mild axonal polyneuropathy with prevalence in legs. CONCLUSIONS In the differential diagnosis of progressive paraperesis, and mainly with epidemic antecedents, it is necessary to include a determination of HTLV-I between the diagnostic tests.</dc:description>
