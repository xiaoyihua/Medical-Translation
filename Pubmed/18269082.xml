<dc:description xml:lang="en">Obesity is associated with a complex systemic inflammatory reaction that has been associated with the development of atherosclerosis and insulin resistance. Obesity also induces macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue. Macrophages produce many of the pro inflammatory molecules released by adipose tissue and have been implicated in the development of obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation. Monocyte chemoattractant proteins (MCPs) and their receptors play key roles in the development of inflammatory responses and are crucial for the recruitment of immune cells towards inflammation sites. Adipose tissue expression of at least 1 MCP, C-C motif chemokine ligand-2 (CCL2 or MCP1), increases in proportion to adiposity. The C-C motif chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) regulates monocyte and macrophage recruitment and is necessary for macrophage-dependent inflammatory responses and the development of atherosclerosis. Because CCR2 regulates monocyte and macrophage chemotaxis and local inflammatory responses, it has been hypothesized that monocyte chemoattractant molecules acting through CCR2 might regulate obesity-induced inflammation in adipose tissue. Our study focuses on the molecular and genetic mechanisms that recruit and retain macrophages in adipose tissue.</dc:description>
