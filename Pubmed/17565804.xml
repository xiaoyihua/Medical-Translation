<dc:description xml:lang="en">The community-oriented primary care (COPC) model strives to efficiently distribute, organize, and systematize existing health care resources. In addition to promoting healthy lifestyles within the community, the COPC model enables the health care team and the community to cooperate in identifying and prioritizing health issues. Together they develop and implement prevention and treatment plans for those priority areas. With COPC, the health services assume responsibility for the health of a defined population. The health services not only treat diseases but also develop programs for health promotion, protection, and maintenance. Taking this approach, COPC integrates individual and family clinical care with public health, reflecting the spirit of the International Conference on Primary Health Care held in Alma-Ata in 1978. COPC is a systematic process, with flexible principles and methodologies that can be modified to meet the specific challenges of any health care team and community. An analysis of various countries' experiences with COPC shows that applying the model appropriately can improve the general health status of the community and its members.</dc:description>
