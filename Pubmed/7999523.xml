<dc:description xml:lang="en">The following report is to appraise the utility of the Selective Committee of Works of the Pediatric Surgery Society as an assessing organ for the Directive Board to develop the scientific program for the annual congress. For this purpose, a revision was made of a four year period (1990-1993), compiling 738 summaries, which focused primarily on the capacity of the communicated message to widen our concept of disease or our diagnostic or therapeutic possibilities. The secondary topic focused on was the way in which the investigation was decided on planned and executed. The last point taken into consideration was the formal aspects of the summary, according to the regulations given to the authors. From the 738 summaries evaluated, 510 were remitted to be presented as oral communications and 228 as posters. From all these, a total of 311 articles were admitted (172 oral communications and 139 posters). The average pointage obtained was 8.22 (maximum: 20). The articles with the highest acceptance were those dealing with experimental surgery and/or clinical investigation (70%), transplantation (665), urology (50.7%), oncology (45.6%), cardiovascular surgery (45.5%) plastic surgery (40.5%), orthopedics (39.1%), digestive-abdominal (36.8%) and maxillofacial surgery (26.3%). In 77.5% of the articles, the study method followed is not specified, in 70.7% there is no description of the results obtained and in 85.4% there is no description of the conclusions. Deducing from the above information exposed, it is necessary to maintain a system of selection of the best communications, which in turn, will guarantee a greater scientific quality in the congresses.</dc:description>
