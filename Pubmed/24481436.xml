<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Trichoepithelioma is a benign follicular tumor, affects young female adults, and has three clinical forms: solitary, multiple, or desmoplastic. Diagnosis represents a clinical challenge for the dermatologist. There are many differential diagnoses, and the most important is basal cell carcinoma because they share histological features. It has good prognosis and therefore treatment is usually for aesthetic purposes, even though it is associated with recurrence. METHODS This is a retrospective study carried out from January 1993 to December 2012 of all the patients who were diagnosed by histopathology to have trichoepithelioma in the dermatology department of the Dr. Manuel Gea González General Hospital. RESULTS There were 47 cases, of which 70.2% were female, with an average age of 43.6 years. Solitary trichoepithelioma was the most frequent clinical form (66%) and only three of 14 cases of multiple trichoepithelioma had a positive family history.</dc:description>
