<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Vitamin A. derivatives known as Retinoids, are among the most exciting pharmacological agents used in the last few years. They strongly influence the keratinizing epithelia, have an antipromoting effect upon experimentally induced tumors and have immunomodulatory activities. Teratogenicity seems to be the most worrisome effect of the retinoids. However, it is reasonable to assume their release for physicians prescription in the near future. This review is intended to provide a general background for their correct use by dermatologists.</dc:description>
