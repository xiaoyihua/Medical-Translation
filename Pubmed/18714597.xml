<dc:description xml:lang="en">This article analyzes women's admission to Mexico's National Academy of Medicine (NAM) originally an all-male institution. We describe the demographic characteristics of female members of the NAM. By the year 2006, the NAM had 536 academic members, 62 of them were women. Data gathered included date of entry to the NAM, members' age at time of admission, current age, whether they had children and the field and or area to which they were assigned. We also analyzed membership to the "National System of Researchers" (Sistema Nacional de Investigadores, SNI). Women admitted to the NAM were all competitive scholars who planned their career choices, sought and achieved positions of power yet gender issues still determined their professional careers.</dc:description>
