<dc:description xml:lang="en">Folate food intake and red blood cell folate concentrations were assess in women from Recife, Northeast Brazil. Following a two stages sampling procedure, a cross-sectional study was carried out involving 360 women, between 15-45 y, attending in nine health care public unit in 2007-2008. Folate intake was evaluated by a Quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire, and compared with the values of the dietary reference intakes-DRI's. Folate status was evaluated by red blood cell folate concentrations. Geometric mean of folate intake was 627.1 [IC 95% 600.4-655.0] microg/day. The frequency of women at risk for folate intake below the recommendation was 16.0% for adolescents (&lt;330 microg/day) and 6.3% for young adult (&lt;320 microg/ day). The prevalence of women whose consumption exceeds the maximum tolerable intake was 48.0% (&gt; 800 microg/day) and 13.7% (&gt; 1000 microg/day) for adolescents and adults, respectively. The mean of red blood cell folate concentrations was 1797.8 +/- 357.1 nmol/L. Folate rich-food intake did not show any correlation with red blood cell folate concentrations (r = 0.058 and p = 0.274). Higher red blood cell folate concentrations were observed in adult young women (p = 0.004) and among those with income up to two minimum wages (p = 0.042). Folate rich-food intake as well as red blood cell folate concentrations among women from Recife were above the international recommendations.</dc:description>
