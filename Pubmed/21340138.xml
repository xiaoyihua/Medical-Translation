<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Determine the influence of nutritional counseling, exercise, access to social healthcare and drugs, and the quality of medical care on the control of diabetics. MATERIAL AND METHODS The information and blood samples were obtained in 2005. Glycemic control was defined as good if HbA1c was ≤7.0%, poor from 7.01%-9.50% and very poor if HbA1c &gt;9.5%. Binary logistic regression models were used to determine the association of these factors with HbA1c&gt;9.5%. RESULTS Thirty percent of the patients with a medical diagnosis of diabetes had adequate metabolic control. CONCLUSIONS Nutritional guidance was associated with an increase in the degree of control. A majority of diabetics have poor or very poor glycemic control. Strengthening the quality of and access to medical care for these patients is urgently needed.</dc:description>
