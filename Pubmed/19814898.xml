<dc:description xml:lang="en">Given that the lack of qualified human resources devoted to primary health care (PHC) is one of the reasons why Alma Ata goals are as yet unattained, PAHO/WHO sponsored the design and implementation of a virtual course for training health care professionals at this level. The course was designed around competencies identified as being necessary for renewing primary care, founded on the premise that providing quality, sustainable services amenable to the public must emanate from professionals who lead the change process at all levels in the system. In this first phase, instruction is aimed at PHC leaders, managers, and other decision makers. The course is offered through the Virtual Public Health Campus and is 27 weeks long.</dc:description>
