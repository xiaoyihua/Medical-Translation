<dc:description xml:lang="en">Apolipoprotein (apo)-beta is an atherosclerotic risk factor in adults and children. In families with Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia (FCH) it has been described as a lipoprotein phenotype called Hyperapobetalipoproteinemia (Hyperapo-beta) and characterized by increased numbers of small, dense and apo-beta enriched low density lipoproteins. In our Lipids Clinic, we have studied 267 children, but for the purpose of this paper we have only taken into account the 19 of these children who showed increased plasma total apo-beta levels (Hyperapo-beta-emina). To investigate the type of dyslipoproteinemia of these children, we divided them into two groups: 1) Group 1: 10 children with apo-beta levels greater than mean + 2 standard deviations (SD); 2) Group 2: 9 children with apo-beta levels greater than mean + 3 SD. We have also studied the fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters of all the children. Only one child (Group 1) had type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia. The other children had type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia. In each group, 4 families had FCH and the others had either Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Polygenic Hypercholesterolemia. Families with FCH could also have hyperapo-beta. It is possible that in the future some children of FCH families and those with type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia will have increased plasma triglyceride levels. This could be prevented by a proper diet.</dc:description>
