<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hyponutrition is a common problem at all health care levels, from primary to specialized care, as well as in geriatric care. Its incidence in a hospital setting is 40% and 60% in nursing homes. This is very important, it is highly related with progressive aging of the European population, and is the biggest and most frequent cause of disability among the elderly population living at home or institutions. Countries such as Holland, Denmark, or the United Kingdom have developed Comprehensive Strategic Plans to fight against hyponutrition by developing and implementing guidelines, establishing mandatory screenings at the moment of hospital admission and discharge, at nursing homes, etc. In our country, a combined action of SENPE and Abbott Foundation is developing a Comprehensive Strategic Plan (+ nutridos Project) in which clear, precise, and validated recommendations are established to perform nutritional screening both in hospitalized patients and institutionalized and ambulatory elderly people. This issue has to take into account the social and financial aspects. Hyponutrition is many times insufficiently recognized and treated. This has a negative impact on the individual patient in terms of morbidity, mortality, independence, and quality of life, as well as on the health care systems in terms of use of health care resources and costs.</dc:description>
