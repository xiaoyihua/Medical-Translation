<dc:description xml:lang="en">Between April 1976 and February 1980, serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme were determined in 61 cases of sarcoidosis at different stages of evolution. Cases were divided in three groups on the basis of social determinations done every 3-6 months. In the group with 46 active cases the increase in mean value of the enzyme is statistically significant compared to the control group; 30 of these (65.2%) had values higher than + 2DS. In the second group with 24 cases of non-progressive or inactive sarcoidosis the mean value was slightly higher than the normal mean value, without being statistically significant; 21 patients (87.5%) showed normal values: in the third group with 19 patients who had been treated with corticosteroids, mean value was equal to normal values; after 12 months treatment values were normal in 17 cases (89.5%). In the control group of 80 patients with a variety of pulmonary diseases other than sarcoidosis (pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, pulmonary thromboembolism and primary lung cancer) only 9 cases presented values higher than the normal + 2SD (11.2% false positive). Serial determination of angiotensin-converting enzyme is a useful diagnostic parameter in sarcoidosis; especially in evaluating progression of the disease as well as the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment.</dc:description>
