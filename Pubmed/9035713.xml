<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Different epidemiological studies have demonstrated that specific anti-Toxocara antibodies are detected in the serum of a high percentage of the Spanish population. But very few clinical cases of visceral larva migrans are being confirmed. METHODS AND RESULTS Two cases of visceral toxocarosis, in two sisters, are described. In the first, the prevailing clinic was swelling of joints and upper respiratory tract symptoms; and asthma and cutaneous allergic manifestations in the second patient. Both cases presented with an elevated blood eosinophil count, high levels of total IgE and high titlers of anti-Toxocara antibodies. All symptoms disappeared after treatment with diethylcarbamazine and they remain asymptomatic several months after. CONCLUSIONS In pediatric population, toxocarosis should be ruled out in every patient with respiratory symptoms, allergic cutaneous manifestations and elevated blood eosinophil count. The anti-Toxocara antibodies assay is of great value in establishing the diagnosis of this parasitic disease.</dc:description>
