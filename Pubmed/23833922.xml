<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Lymphatic malformations are congenital lesions usually placed in the head and neck, the abdominal location is infrequent. OBJECTIVES Analyze our experience in ALM management. METHOD Retrospective study of pediatric patients with ALM from 1996 to 2011. It is a descriptive analysis of clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic features. RESULTS 10 patients with ALM were treated (6 girls: 4 boys), with a median age of 4.03 years (3 days-13 years). Acute abdomen was the most common presenting feature (40%). Ultrasound was carried out in all these cases, completing the study with CT (9 cases), MRI (1) or both (1). Treatment was surgical, excepting one case that presented infection of the ALM. The approach by laparotomy allowed total resection in all cases, involving bowel resection in 6. The mass was located in small bowel mesentery (6), mesocolon (1), liver (1), and in retroperitoneum (1). The final pathologic diagnosis showed an error in diagnostic imaging of 60%.The mean follow-up was 18 months (SD: 12.8), with not recurrences. CONCLUSIONS ALM often manifests in a non-specific form and it may remain silent. Imaging studies guide the diagnosis, but only the histology provides a definitive result. Total resection is the best option to prevent recurrences and minimize complications.</dc:description>
