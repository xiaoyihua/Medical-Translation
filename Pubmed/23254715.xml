<dc:description xml:lang="en">The scientific research goals developed and applied beyond their own frontiers, by the National Institutes of Health and High Specialty Hospitals, are presented regarding the specialized medical care of excellence on the field of global health, in benefice of the Mexican population. Maternal mortality as well as malnutrition, and the lack of micronutrients in the pregnant mother and child, put them in disadvantage to face future physical and mental diseases. Low weight at birth, prematurity, and overweight during childhood are factors that can trigger the the development of the metabolic syndrome, with all its consequences on physical and mental health. These challenges are faced with a preventive vision by means of pilot programs like "Towards a new generation of Mexicans" and "Chronic kidney disease stratification in high risk patients", besides the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of other chronic diseases such as cancer, hypertension, and diabetes among others by decreasing the number of overweight and obesity people in the Mexican population.</dc:description>
