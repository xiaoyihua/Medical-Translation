<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Intracranial lipomas are infrequent tumours and especially so when they are situated in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA), when they only constitute 0.05% of the total number. CASE REPORT We present the case of a CPA lipoma diagnosed in a 38-year-old female with hypoacusis as the presenting symptom and in which magnetic resonance (MR) was the complementary test that proved most useful as a diagnostic aid. There was a hyperintense image in T1 in the right-side CPA that did not take up contrast and which was interpreted as a fatty tumour. CONCLUSIONS We discuss the clinical manifestations of CPA lipomas, the means that can be used to diagnose them (mainly focused on the value of MRI) and the procedure to be followed in dealing with these tumours according to the experience obtained from the relatively scarce number of cases reported to date. We underline the idea that these lesions are currently considered to be embryonic development disorders rather than actual neoplasias.</dc:description>
