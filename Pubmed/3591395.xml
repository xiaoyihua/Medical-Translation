<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper is concerned about the need Man has to know himself as well as his destiny, the need he feels for determining standpoints or landmarks in his life. Turbulences come up which we call 'crisis'. One of them is the so called 'middle life crisis': both sexes undergo it between their thirties and their fourties--some people slightly before, some other people later on. Youth is passing by and Man feels sorry for that. The passing by of Time leaves tremendous scars, at first in the biological realm, in the psychologic one afterwards. This is how Man Knows he has reached the top of the mountain, hence that the descent is about to take place. Parents in the old age, parents who die--these factors do contribute to the sensation of one becoming old. Clearer and clearer each time, Man feels he will be the next one who is bound to get old and die. Middle life crisis has Man recognizing that some of his most praised dreams are never to come true. This means accepting that life will be over soon enough. In case Man didn't betray his own self too much, it is still time for him to start and capitalize his former experiences thus increasing both his creativity and insight.</dc:description>
