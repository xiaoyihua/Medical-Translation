<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Urinary tract infections in children are associated with functional and anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract, they tend to recur and can cause permanent kidney damage. AIM To study in children with urinary tract infections, microbiological factors associated to recurrence, functional and anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract. PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective sample of children was incorporated into a follow-up protocol after their first episode of bacteriologically-demonstrated urinary tract infection. In all patients an abdominal ultrasound examination and a mictional urethrocystography were done and the presence of fimbriae was studied in isolated strains of Escherichia coli. RESULTS Two hundred fifteen cases bad an adequate adherence to the study protocol, 190 caused by E coli. Fimbriated E coli strains were isolated with greater frequency from children with pyelonephritis than from those with a low urinary tract infection (50 and 28% respectively). The absence of fimbriae in E coli strains was associated with a higher risk of recurrent infections (odds ratio = 3, confidence intervals = 2-9.2) and an abnormal urethrocystography (odds ratio = 3, confidence intervals = 1.1-10.2). CONCLUSIONS These data are consistent with foreign reports and support the need to study adhesins in E coli strains isolated from children with urinary tract infections.</dc:description>
