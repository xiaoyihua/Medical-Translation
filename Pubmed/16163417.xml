<dc:description xml:lang="en">Microbiological analysis allows us to identify the etiology of pneumonia and its in vitro susceptibility pattern. Antibiotic treatment directed against a known pathogen enables us to narrow antibacterial spectrum of action, and to reduce costs, drug adverse effects risk and antibiotic resistance. However it is unnecessary to perform extended microbiological studies in all patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Etiological studies must be based in pneumonia severity, epidemiological risk factors and clinical response to empirical treatment. Routine microbiological analysis for ambulatory patients is not recommended. In patients with persistent cough and worsening in their general conditions, a sputum sample must be obtained to perform an acid-fast smear and Mycobacterium culture. The risk of complications and death of patients hospitalized with CAP justifies basic microbiological exploration (sputum Gram staining and culture, blood cultures, pleural fluid culture) intending to obtain a more accurate etiology of pulmonary infection and to guide specific antibiotic treatment. Paired serum samples obtained to document atypical pathogen infections (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae) and urine sample to detect Legionella pneumophila antigenuria are recommended in all CAP severely ill patients that are admitted to ICU, in those not responding to betalactamic drug treatment and in selected patients with specific epidemiological risks. A microbiological study would be useful in management of patients with severe CAP pneumonia outbreaks with clinical-epidemiological particular characteristics, and in-patients with empirical antimicrobial treatment failure.</dc:description>
