<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Computed tomography (CT) is a diagnostic tool that has won acceptance in the past years for the vascular evaluation of living renal donor (LRD) candidates. We show the findings observed in a series of 102 candidates consecutively evaluated in our centre and present the correlation with the surgical data obtained in those individuals finally operated. METHODS From May 1995 to June 2005, 102 LRD candidates were evaluated with CT. Eighteen were also studied with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Fifty-eight donors underwent nephrectomy. Prevalence of arterial and venous variants found on CT exams were analyzed, as well as the correlation with surgical and DSA data when they were obtained. RESULTS Forty-four percent candidates showed multiple renal arteries at least in one kidney. Seventy-one percent of right kidneys and 76% of left kidneys had a single arterial pedicle. Early branching was observed in 7.8% and 15.7% in right and left kidneys respectively. Venous variants were present in 17.5% and the 13.7% in right and left sides respectively. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CT to detect accessory arteries were 89%, 100% and 97% respectively when it was compared to DSA. Correlation with surgical data raised 93% for the presence of arterial variants. CONCLUSIONS Vascular variants in renal pedicle showed a high prevalence. Helical CT can effectively achieve all the information required prior to surgery as a sole imaging procedure in LRD candidates.</dc:description>
