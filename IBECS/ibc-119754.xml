<dc:description xml:lang="en">Background/Purpose. The aetiology of acute appendicitis (AA) is unknown. The purpose of the present study was to investigate if there is a relationship between heredity and AA. Methods. A case-control study was carried out during 18 months including children between 4 and 14 years old. Cases were 147 children who underwent an appendectomy with histologic confirmation of AA. Controls were 161 children hospitalized by other causes. Comparisons were made between the two groups, and Odds Ratios with 95% confidence interval were estimated for gender, age, body mass index and family histories of AA on first and second-degrees relatives. Results. Girls (OR=1,83) and children between 9-11 years old (1.84) showed higher risks of AA and in children with high body mass index have lower rates (0.64), A positive parental history of AA was reported by 65% of cases and 55% of controls (OR=1,50). The odds ratio was higher when the relatives with AA were of first degree (OR=1.32), and when two relatives were affected (OR=2.47). Conclusions. Our study gives some evidence that children with a family history of AA are at higher risk of AA, but we cannot assure whether the higher risk is due to an heredity transmission or to a shared exposure in the same family environmental factors (AU)</dc:description>
