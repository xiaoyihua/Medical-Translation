<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of a system set up to overcome the current disparity between primary and specialist health care and with the capacity to detect patients with significant diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS To describe the activity of the Unit for Connection with Primary Care Centres (UCPCC) in the Alcoy Health Area (Alicante) during its first year. RESULTS A total of 450 visits were made, with 6.5 (95% CI 5.7-7.3) first visits, and 3.9 (95% CI 3.1-4.8) successive ones per day. There were more than 50 reasons for consultation, and more than 60 final diagnoses (65.6% non-significant, 14% undefined and 12.4% significant). Digestive (31%) and functional (14.4%) diseases were the most frequently defined diagnoses, with neoplasic and autoimmune diseases among those defined as significant ones. The great majority (86.9%) of patients required 1-2 visits, with 40% diagnosed by just reviewing the hospital files. More than 20 different complementary examinations were performed, with 38.8%, 34.4%, 21.6%, and 5.2% of patients requiring 0, 1, 2, or ≥ 3, respectively. Patients with a significant pathology were diagnosed more quickly (12.4 ± 19.4 vs. 45.3 ± 52.8 days; P = .001), with less complementary examinations (0,5 ± 0,7 vs. 0,9 ± 0,9 per patient; P = .032. 58.6% vs. 39.6% patients without complementary examinations; P = .052), and were more frequently referred to specialised medicine (58.6% vs. 18.3%, P &lt; .0001). CONCLUSIONS The demonstrated differential management of patients with potentially significant pathology using existing resources, make the UCPCC with internists an efficient model for the connection between health care levels.</dc:description>
