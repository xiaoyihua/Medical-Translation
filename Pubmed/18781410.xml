<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Following the latest examination of the worldwide mental health situation, the World Health Organization has estimated that depression produces the greatest decrement in health compared with other chronic diseases, and has encouraged to all countries to increase investment and resources in this field. METHODOLOGY On investing resources for the care of patients with depression, cost of illness studies are a complement to morbidity-mortality studies, and are of great relevance in defining health care policies. The present study describes the economic impact of depression in our setting, in the light of the most recent publications on this subject. RESULTS The total cost of depression in Europe has been estimated to reach 118 billion euros, and most of this amount (61 %) is due to indirect costs associated with sick leave and productivity losses. The economic burden of depression in Spain could add up to 5.005 million euros a year, with a resource category distribution very similar to that found in Europe as a whole. CONCLUSIONS Health care systems and society must cope with the important costs of depression, which implies intense resource utilization, fundamentally outside the health care sector as such. There are a number of areas in which improvements can be made in order to reduce this important burden associated with depression, though the incorporation of health economics to public health care policies must become a priority.</dc:description>
