<dc:description xml:lang="en">Fusobacterium spp. are Gram negative anaerobe bacteria. Vertebral osteomyelitis caused by these bacteria is very unusual; in fact, we could only find 11 cases in the literature. We report the case of a male, 46 year-old patient who had had lumbar pain for several weeks that irradiated to the right leg, and did not respond to NSAID treatment. The work-up included MRI, biopsy with draining of the collection and a universal PCR followed by 16S rDNA sequencing. The latter was used to make the microbiologic diagnosis, which identified Fusobacterium nucleatum as the causative agent. Final treatment consisted of clindamycin. In conclusion, spondylodiscitis due to Fusobacterium spp. is a rare and difficult to diagnose entity, due both to its clinical characteristics and to the difficulty in making the right microbiologic diagnosis. Vertebral biopsy and molecular microbiologic techniques such as Universal PCR rDNa, are essential to identifying the organism, making the diagnosis and prescribing appropriate antibiotic therapy.</dc:description>
