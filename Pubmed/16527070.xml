<dc:description xml:lang="en">An increasing number of children are consulting for various problems or disorders that are based on mistreatment at school. Bullying is defined as persistent physical or emotional violence by a school-aged child or group of children against another school-aged child who is unable to defend himself in this situation, which takes place in the school area. This type of behavior involves the aggressor, the victim, the group of classmates, the institution (teachers, the psychopedagogic team, the management team) and the families (those of the aggressor and victim, and the parents association). Bullying is a type of disorder that can be included in some of the typologies described by Terr in Postraumatic Stress Disorder in childhood, specifically in type II or chronic disorder and in type III or mixed disorder (chronic with phases of acute reactivation). Longitudinal studies have reported an association between having been bullied at school and the possibility of suffering from mobbing, mostly in the form of work harassment. Surprisingly, there can be a "pact of silence" between classmates. Schools are perceived as being more tolerant with the aggressors than with the victims of bullying.</dc:description>
