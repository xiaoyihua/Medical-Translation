<dc:description xml:lang="en">Several studies have shown that adaptation of various viruses to grow in certain cell lines of vertebrates, leads to the selection of virus variants that bind heparan sulfate (HS) with high affinity. In this study we investigated the susceptibility of strains of dengue virus (DENV) to oversulfated heparin an analogue of HS after passages in BHK-21 cells. Field isolates of the four serotypes of DENV with a limited number of passes in mosquito cells C6/36HT were serially passaged eight times in BHK-21 cells. The adaptation of the DENV to the cell culture selected viral variants with an increased replicative capacity in BHK-21 cells and an increased susceptibility to heparin compared with the original not adapted strains, with a more significant inhibition of the infectivity in DENV-2 and DENV-4.The E protein of the adapted strains showed changes in the amino acid sequence, particularly at the position K204R to DENV-1, N67K to DENV-2, K308R and V452A for DENV-3 and E327G to DENV-4. These substitutions implicated a gain of basic residues that increased the net positive charge of the protein. These results suggest that adaptation of DENV strains to BHK-21 cells implies changes in the envelope protein, changes associated to the protein reactivity with heparin, the inhibitory effectiveness of this compound varying depending on the viral strain. In addition, these results suggest that the HS can play an important role in the infectivity of the DENV strains adapted to vertebrate cell culture, but not in the infectivity of non-adapted DENV isolates.</dc:description>
