<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors examined material from the respiratory tract obtained from 55 patients, with silver Methenamine and Giemsa stains to detect Pneumocystis carinii. Twenty five patients were positive. All had fever and fatigue, 80% had dyspnea, 72% had productive cough, and significant weight loss occurred in 48%. None of the patients had signs of pulmonary consolidation. Chest X-Ray showed diffuse infiltrates in 55.2%. Nodular lesions in both lung fields were present in 6.9%. A local infiltrate was seen in 13.6% and no infiltrates were seen in 10.3%. LDH was elevated in all (ranging from 885 4500 UI), 84% of the patients had a PO2 of 70 mmHg or less. Most of the patients, 80%, responded to therapy with Trimethoprim-Sulfa.</dc:description>
