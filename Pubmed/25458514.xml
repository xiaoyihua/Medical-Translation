<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Pulmonary hemorrhage (PH) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare but potentially fatal complication that occurs most frequently in the context of active lupus with involvement of other organs. The objective of this study is to report the clinical features and prognosis of patients with SLE who had PH. METHODS Patients with SLE (1982 American College of Rheumatology criteria) and PH under monitoring between June 1999 and November 2011 were studied. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and prognosis data related to PH were analyzed. RESULTS Eleven patients with SLE developed 14 episodes of PH. PH was the first manifestation of SLE in 2 patients. The most frequent symptoms and clinical signs were dyspnea, fever and cough, which occurred in 12 (85%), 11 (77%) and 7 (50%) patients, respectively. Hemoptysis was also observed in 5 (35%) episodes, tachycardia in 2 (14%), pallor in one (7%) and chest pain in one (7%). All patients had other concomitant organ involvement, and were treated with glucocorticoids. In addition, intravenous cyclophosphamide was indicated in 12 episodes and plasma exchange in 4. Overall mortality was 64%. Factors associated with mortality were infection, mechanical ventilation and dialysis. CONCLUSIONS PH continues to be a rare and severe complication of SLE. Its suspected presence forces us to quickly study these patients, since early diagnosis and aggressive treatment have been shown to improve survival in them.</dc:description>
