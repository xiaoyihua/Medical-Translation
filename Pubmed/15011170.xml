<dc:description xml:lang="en">Different therapeutic models have been presented with which to treat the condition of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the scientific literature speaks of the benefits linked to multimodal approaches. The National Institute of Mental Health report grants combined treatments an essential role. Throughout the literature authors agree that the executive functions are intrinsically related to the functions of the frontal lobe. We consider executive function training (EFT) to be another resource available within the different approaches used to treat ADHD and which is oriented towards developing and reinforcing the neuropsychological functions so as to give rise to new cognitive resources. Working memory is responsible for storage for a minimum amount of time while the information needed to resolve higher cognitive processes is manipulated. Some authors consider executive dysfunction to be a distinguishing element of ADHD. This type of dysfunction would make it more difficult for the higher cognitive processes to be carried out and is therefore a disorder that conditions the problems observed in the formal academic learning processes. The EFT programme consists of specific work modules and is aimed at favouring the appearance, development and operation of the affected functions.</dc:description>
