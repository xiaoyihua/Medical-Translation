<dc:description xml:lang="en">Asthma is a chronic complex and heterogeneous disease, with great variability and has a huge impact, not only on patients who suffer the disease but also their families and society in general. The education of the asthmatic patient and their families is essential for therapeutic intervention. Through continuous, dynamic and adaptive education, changes in attitudes and behaviours of the patient and family can be achieved, and will undoubtedly lead to an improvement in their quality of life. Among other non-pharmacological interventions, respiratory rehabilitation is an alternative treatment, and is primarily aimed at patients with moderate to severe asthma. Although the latest clinical practice guidelines published in the scientific literature recommend two strategies for treatment, the results of relevant publications are diverse. The objective of this study was to describe the effectiveness of therapeutic and educational programs in respiratory rehabilitation of the asthmatic patient.</dc:description>
