<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The systemic inflammatory response syndrome developed after cardiac surgery impedes the detection of complications. The aim of our study was to examine the behaviour of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), as well as to evaluate its relationship with severity and to analyse its usefulness in the identification of complications. METHODS A total of 59 children who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were prospectively studied. CRP and PCT were determined after surgery and at 24, 48 and 72 hours. The relationships between both parameters and the clinical severity were analysed (evaluated with PRISM and TISS scoring systems), as well as with the incidence of complications (infectious and haemodynamics). RESULTS Serum concentrations of CRP and PCT increased in the first 24 hours after surgery, with a gradual decrease over the following days. There was no association between CRP and severity or development of complications. A moderate correlation was observed between PCT after surgery, at 24 and 48 hours, and PRISM (r=0.548; 0.434 and 0.446) and a low correlation between PCT and TISS. When studying the identification of complications, we obtained cut-off values of PCT&gt;0.17ng/ml (Ss 73.3%; Sp 72.2%) and PCT&gt;1.98ng/ml (Ss 57.1%; Sp 87%) immediately and 48 hours after surgery. No differences were found in CPR and PCT levels among patients with infectious and haemodynamics complications. CONCLUSIONS CPR does not correlate with the severity or the incidence of complications after paediatric cardiac surgery. PCT correlates with clinical severity and may be able to detect post-surgical complications.</dc:description>
