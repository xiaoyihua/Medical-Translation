<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present our experience with the method of Direct Intraperitoneal Insemination (DIPI) in cases of infertility during 56 cycles with ovarian stimulation in 15 women 53.3% of our cases are primary sterility cases. The principal indication for DIPI was male factor (six cases), endometriosis three cases, cervical hostility, three cases and compound cases the other ones. The average age was 33.7% years. Always we used the induction of ovulation according to the protocol of Frydman with clinical monitorization. The seminal fluid was treated with the swim-up method and was placed in the pelvic peritoneum with a spinal needle by direct transvaginal puncture, during the ovulatory period. We have obtained five pregnancies (33.3%) one of them ectopic (6.66). We have been successful in all cases of cervical hostility and in one case of compound etiology. There are no complications in this series with DIPI. It is discussed the place of DIPI among the technology of assisted fertilization.</dc:description>
