<dc:description xml:lang="en">After a follow up of 22 months we report results of treatment on 44 patients (22 males), aged 16 to 63 years, with acute non lymphoblastic leukemia. Complete remission was obtained in 22 patients. This was significantly more frequent in patients under 40 years of age with white cell counts under 35,000 and without metabolic complications nor disseminated intravascular coagulation before treatment. Delaying chemotherapy for 5 days after diagnosis was also associated to a better prognosis. Overall actuarial survival rate was 37% at 15 months, 55% for those experiencing a first remission. A total of 25 patients [corrected] have died, 15 during induction of therapy, 7 after complete remission and 3 after failure of induction. Infections are the main cause of death during induction, with a high lethality for sepsis (33%) and pneumonia (40%).</dc:description>
