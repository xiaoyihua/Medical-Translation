<dc:description xml:lang="en">Popliteal aneurysm is a rather infrequent lesion which may cause severe ischemia and loss of the extremity. Between 1975 and 1990, 21 patients, all male with a mean age of 73 years, presented with popliteal aneurysm which was associated to aneurysm in other arteries in 62% and other medical problems in 95% of patients. 61% of patients had severe ischemia due to thrombosis or embolism. Surgery was performed for 29 lesions (10 as an emergency). Exclusion and bypass was performed in 26 (20 with saphenous vein and 6 with a prosthesis). Amputation due to irreversible ischemia was required in 3 patients. There was no mortality in this series and only 1 patient required later amputation. Permeability was estimated at 85% at 5 years of follow up, including all bypasses. We conclude that popliteal aneurysm should be diagnosed and electively operated with saphenous vein grafting.</dc:description>
