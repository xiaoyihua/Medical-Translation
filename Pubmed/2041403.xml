<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hydrogen peroxide is used as a preserver in milk industry. Three cases of accidental ingestion of 60% hydrogen peroxide (oxygenated water 200 volumes). The patients were male stockbreeders aged 30, 45 and 62 years, respectively, who stored that powerful oxidizing agent in commercial drink containers without adequate labeling. One of them was admitted comatose and required assisted ventilation. After recovering consciousness migratory paresis of right limbs and of the VI cranial nerve were observed, which were reversed after ten days, and left hemiparesia that persisted for two months. Upper gastrointestinal tract lesions, particularly in stomach, were detected in all. The endoscopic and pathological findings are described in detail. The outcome was satisfactory in the three patients, with complete remission of the lesions. There appears to be a direct relationship between the severity of symptoms and the amount of ingested peroxide, dependent on the diameter of the opening of the container. Only five reports have been identified related to the oral poisoning by this substance.</dc:description>
