<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Healthy state depends on the appropriate function of the homeostatic systems (nervous, endocrine and immune systems) and the correct communication between them. The functional and redox state of the immune system is an excellent marker of health, and animals with premature immunosenescence show a shorter lifespan. Since catecholamines modulate the function of immune cells, the alteration in their synthesis could provoke immunosenescence. The social environment could be a strategy for modulating this immunosenescence. AIM To determine if an haploinsufficiency of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the limiting enzyme of synthesis of catecholamines, may produce a premature immunosenescence and if this immunosenescence could be modulated by the social environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Adult (9±1 months) male ICR-CD1 mice with deletion of a single allele (hemi-zygotic: HZ) of the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme (TH-HZ) and wild-type (WT) mice were used. Animals were housed in four subgroups: WT&gt;50% (in the cage, the proportion of WT mice was higher than 50% in relation to TH-HZ), WT&lt;50%, TH-HZ&lt;50% and TH-HZ&gt;50%. Peritoneal leukocytes were collected and phagocytosis, chemotaxis and proliferation of lymphocytes in the presence of lipopolysaccharide were analyzed. Glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase activities as well as oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio were studied. RESULTS TH-HZ&gt;50% mice showed a deteriorated function and redox state in leukocytes respect to WT&gt;50% and similar to old mice. However, TH-HZ&lt;50% animals had similar values to those found in WT&lt;50% mice. CONCLUSION The haploinsufficiency of TH generates premature immunosenescence, which appears to be compensated by living together with an appropriate number of WT animals.</dc:description>
