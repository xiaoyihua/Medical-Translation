<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The global epidemic of overweight and obesity is becoming, as its growth into a major public health problem in many parts of the world affects about half the general population and is therefore a problem common among fertile. EXPOSURE Obesity and overweight are common conditions that have implications not only for overall health, but also largely on reproductive health. A high prevalence of obese women in the sterile population and numerous studies have highlighted the link between obesity and infertility. Obesity increases the risks of obstetric and neonatal complications, including decreased fertility in women who ovulate and is also associated with menstrual disorders and increased risk of recurrent spontaneous abortions. CONCLUSIONS Changes in lifestyle, the realization of a diet and exercise program, are the first line of treatment for obesity.</dc:description>
