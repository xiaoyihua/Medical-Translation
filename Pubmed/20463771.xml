<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To determine the self-perception of oral health levels and the need for treatment, hygienic habits and frequency of visits to the dentist amongst schoolchildren in Navarre. METHODS The population of the study was aged 6, 12 and 14 years. The sample was obtained from schools teaching 1st and 6th year in Primary Education and 2nd year in Compulsory Secondary Education. The data was gathered through self-answering questionnaires. RESULTS Ninety-two percent of 6 and 12 year olds, and 82.9% of 14 year olds are satisfied with their oral health. Thirteen point one percent of 12 year olds and 19.3% of 14 year olds are dissatisfied, above all with misaligned teeth. Approximately one-third think they need some treatment, above all fillings at age 6 and orthodontics at 12 and 14 years. Nearly two-thirds say they brush their teeth more than once a day and between 80 and 90% say they have visited the dentist in the last year. More than 75% of those responsible for the schoolchildren aged 6 and 12 years make a positive evaluation of the contributions of the child dental care program (PADI) and more than 95% are satisfied with the care given by PADI dentists to their children. Sex, average residence and socioeconomic level barely influence the perception of health, frequency of brushing teeth or need for treatment. CONCLUSION The study reveals that the subjective perception of oral health is good and that one-third of those surveyed think they need some type of treatment. It is very positive that they majority say that they have been to the dentist in the last year and that they brush their teeth more than once a day, which is an improvement on the results of previous studies.</dc:description>
