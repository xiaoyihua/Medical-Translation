<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this epidemiological study was to ascertain the present status of the dental health of 1,041 schoolchildren, from 4 to 15 years old, in three towns in the Vera District (Cáceres). The OMS and FDI methods were used for the exploration, omitting the use of X-rays, but employing the material recommended for the clinical examination, and our including the use of the plate developer (erythrosine). The results obtained revealed that an average of 74.92% of the children had cavities, a CAOD of 3.77 and a cod of 2.05, from which we deduced a lack of dental care, given that 7.58% of the schoolchildren were checked, 26.32% having problems with their six-year molars, 30.25% of the children having defective bites and an irregular, improper oral hygiene. In light of this situation, their dental health will probably deteriorate increasingly if urgent measures are not taken, including dental hygiene programs, dental health training provided through doctors' offices and schools, a weekly application of fluoride while the children are school age and even including dental care provided by the Public Health System, on an increasing basis, beginning with the compulsory age group (6-years-olds).</dc:description>
