<dc:description xml:lang="en">A total of 85 strains of Gram positive cocci isolated from beach water and sand located in Valparaiso bay, and Viña del Mar, Chile, were examined for 59 morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. The taxonomic data were analysed by numerical taxonomy using Ssm coefficient and the Unweighted Pair Group Method of Association (UPGMA). At 80% similarity level, four phenons were obtained. Of the 85 strains 31% were classified as Staphylococcus epidermidis, 9% were classified as Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 36% were classified as Staphylococcus spp. and 24% as Staphylococcus aureus. Epidemiological considerations are made in relation with the probable impact that the isolation of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococci would have on the health of the population.</dc:description>
