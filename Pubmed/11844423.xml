<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To value the satisfaction between mothers about the different professionals and the prenatal promotion on breast-feeding (BF) in our basic health zone. To value the role of a paediatric prenatal contact in the health centre. DESIGN An descriptive and retrospective, cross-sectional study based on an anonymous closed questionnaire filled by two groups without random selection defined on the variable yes/no BF. SETTING Paediatric room in the Health Centre of Lugones, Health Area of Oviedo. PARTICIPANTS Every mother of childs aged between 6 and 18 months attending to the Healthy Child Program since June to November of 2000. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS 60 questionnaires were delivered, 51 to the group BF and 9 to the group no BF (85% BF including mixed and independent of the duration). 52 questionnaires were collected, 44 BF and 8 no BF. We observe a great satisfaction in both groups on the area midwife, who is considered decisive. Obstetrician, hospital and primary nurse, hospital paediatrician and general practitioner may improve their rule in BF promotion. Both groups are interested in the prenatal visit with the health centre paediatrician. Women on no BF group thought that this interview could have changed their decision. CONCLUSIONS Area midwife is considered the most value professional by the mothers. Hospital and primary professionals may improve his rule in BF promotion in our basic health zone. Only 50% women in no BF group took their decision before the birth. They think that the prenatal paediatric visit could have changed their decision.</dc:description>
