<dc:description xml:lang="en">Treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a goal or «Treat to target» strategy is a therapeutic proposal taken from cardiovascular and endocrine literature. It proposes that the therapeutic target in RA should be a state of remission, or an alternative goal could be a low disease activity. Rheumatologists should measure and register disease activity in every clinical visit and if the goal has not been reached, therapeutic adjustments should be made. Current evidence from clinical trials and a meta-analysis supports the notion that this strategy has important clinical benefits in patients with early RA when compared with routine care. It is also described that using protocolized treatment offers greater benefits. Recent data from Dutch cohorts is presented showing its successful implementation. A discussion is offered on the need of more studies in established RA.</dc:description>
