<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Limited data is available regarding the hepatic safety of maraviroc in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV and/or HBV. Our objective was to compare the hepatic safety profile and fibrosis progression in HIV-mono-infected patients and co-infected with HCV and/or HBV treated with maraviroc. METHODS Retrospective multicentre cohort study of HIV-infected patients receiving treatment with a maraviroc-containing regimen in 27 hospitals in Spain. RESULTS A total of 667 patients were analyzed, of whom 313 were co-infected with HCV (n=282), HBV (n=14), or both (n=17). Maraviroc main indications were salvage therapy (52%) and drug toxicity (20%). Grade 3-4 hypertransaminasaemia (AST/ALT &gt;5 times ULN) per 100 patient-years of maraviroc exposure, was 5.84 (95% CI, 4.04-8.16) and 1.23 (95% CI, 0.56-2.33) in co-infected and HIV-mono-infected patients, respectively (incidence rate ratio, 4.77; 95% CI, 2.35-10.5). However, the degree of aminotransferase abnormalities remained stable throughout the study in both groups, and no significant between-group differences were seen in the cumulative proportion of patients showing an increase in AST/ALT levels greater than 3.5 times baseline levels. No between-group differences were seen in liver fibrosis over time. With a maraviroc median exposure of 20 months (IQR, 12-41), two patients (0.3%) discontinued maraviroc because of grade 4 hepatitis, and other 2 died due to complications associated to end-stage-liver disease. CONCLUSIONS Maraviroc-containing regimens showed a low incidence of hepatitis in a large Spanish cohort of HIV-infected patients, including more than 300 patients co-infected with HCV and/or HBV. Co-infection did not influence the maximum liver enzyme level or the fibrosis progression throughout the study.</dc:description>
