<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thromboembolism problem is a grave complication which occurs with great frequency in patients hospitalized in a critical state. The association between periferical venous thrombosis and the thromboembolic accident is plainly demonstrated, although the accurate establishment of the clinical diagnosis of phlebothrombosis is only feasible in 50% of the cases. In the present work, we describe the methodology and the experience which we have acquired with the use of radioisotops in the diagnosis of these problems. We studied 64 patients to whom in the supine position we injected into a vein in both heels, from 3 to 5 millicuries of 99m-Tecnecio, practicing three stages: dynamic venography, a static study, and a pulmonary gammagram. In the normal cases, we clearly identified the tracts of the principal femural, iliac, and the inferior third of the inferior vena cava veins. In the abnormal studies, we observed the obstructive process manifested by the absence of radioactivity in the affected venous tract, with appearence of collateral circulation, definitive data which establishes with certainty the diagnosis. It can be concluded that the method is rapid and easily carried out, meaning that it could be a routine practice in all of those patients who are suspected of having this problem.</dc:description>
