<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION To get good results in the treatment of chronic diseases, we need the participation of patients who take decisions, where education is the most relevant factor. We analyze the limits and impact of an educational strategy during six group sessions through a month. OBJECTIVE To evaluate clinical control in patients with diabetes and hypertension after group sessions. MATERIAL AND METHODS It was included a group of 172 patients with diabetes and hypertension who went to a help group in 2003; There were two groups, a Group A with 88 patients who finished the educational strategy and a group B with 88 patients who left after the second session. RESULTS The group A diminish glucose average -82 mg/dL (p&lt;0.0001) and also lowered the systolic arterial tension -11.7 mm Hg (p&lt;0.0001) and the diastolic tension -6.9 mm Hg (p&lt;0.0001); there were not significant changes in group B. We used a repeated measured model 4 months before, during and 4 months after educational strategy, and there was a difference between the groups (p=0.008) and also the persistent effect after the educative strategy. CONCLUSION We consider that improvement in clinical control was associated with the strategy used, because education motivate patients to take decisions to face real problematic situations, and helps them to think over life circumstances, and to have health live styles to control both diabetes and hypertension.</dc:description>
