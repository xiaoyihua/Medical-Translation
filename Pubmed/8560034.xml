<dc:description xml:lang="en">Primary testicular lymphoma (PTL) is the most frequently diagnosed testicular tumor in men over 60 years, in spite of this circumstance it is a rare process. Two cases of PTL are reported, the first one in a child and the second in an adult. Both cases were intermediate grade lymphoma and had low stage (IEA), presenting initially as an enlargement of the testicle as the only symptom, the second case presented involvement by contiguity of the abdominal muscles. Immunohistological markers showed T nature in the first case, and B in the second. The treatment applied in both cases was orchiectomy and systemic chemotherapy using COP-BLAM/IMVP-16, in the child prophylaxis of the central nervous system using methotrexate was made. Response to treatment was good, the first patient achieved complete remission and his survival at present is 24 months, the second patient died 5 month after diagnosis due to stroke without having completed chemotherapy but with an important reduction of the tumoral mass. A review of the literature on clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic issues is made.</dc:description>
