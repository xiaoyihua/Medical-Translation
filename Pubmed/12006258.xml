<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND As a producer of gastro-enteritis and other symptoms, Salmonella spp. Remains an important problem for world public health. Epidemiological knowledge at both general and local level by means of serotypification is considered one of the fundamental aspects for its control. MATERIAL AND METHOD We studied 15.181 stool samples, and the others specimens. Isolation using the usual routine media, agar MacConkey, Salmonella-Shigella, selenito F. Identification using the automated Microscan and wider I method, serotypification with multi-purpose and monospecific serums (Difco), and confirmation of Salmonella and Shigella by the National Reference Laboratory, from the LNRSSE. RESULTS Although 96.6% of Salmonella spp. Is detected in cultures of faeces and blood, it is also noted in LCR, sputum, rectal biopsy and vaginal secretions among other sites. In total of 1290 patients, 37 different serotypes were isolated, the most frequent of which were Enteritidis and Typhimurium. The presence of Virchow, isolated in both faeces and LCR, was notable in the years 94-99, as was as the presence of less typical serotypes, such as Blockley, London, Give and Mikawasima, among others.</dc:description>
