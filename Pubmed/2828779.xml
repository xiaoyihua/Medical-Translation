<dc:description xml:lang="en">A comparative study between ketoconazole and itraconazole in the prophylactic and curative treatment of experimental paracoccidioidomycosis in rats and guinea pigs was carried out. Ninety seven Wistar rats were inoculated intracardiacally with the yeast-phase of P. brasiliensis with the purpose of evaluating the prophylactic treatment. Eighty one guinea pigs were injected intratesticularly with the same microorganism with the aim of studying the healing treatment. Both drugs were administered by gavage once a day. The prophylactic treatment started 3 days before the challenger inoculation and the healing treatment begun 10 days after the challenger inoculation. The animals were divided in four groups: I), control animals to which only the solvents of both drugs were administered; II), those which received ketoconazole 40 mg/kg/day; III), those treated with the same drug 80 mg/kg/day, and IV), animals treated with itraconazole 8 mg/kg/day. Seven to 30 days after starting the healing and prophylactic treatments the results were evaluated. Itraconazole seems to be as effective as ketoconazole at 5 fold lower dosage.</dc:description>
