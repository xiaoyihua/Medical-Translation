<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Chlamydia Trachomatis is at present the most prevalent pathogenic agent among the causes of sexually transmitted diseases in developed countries, and has reached epidemic proportions in some of them. These infections can give rise to a considerable number of complications, many with very serious consequences. Given that, in addition, a great number of cases are asymptomatic, a general consensus exists about the convenience of carrying out screening programmes. The aim of this study is to accomplish the first stage of the screening programme of asymptomatic infection by C. trachomatis in women who seek help at a family planning centre. METHODS A descriptive study to determine the prevalence each year of the period studied, an analysis of its temporal tendency and the assessment of the programme effectiveness in terms of a proportional reduction in prevalence. A total number of 6.746 women were included, who attended the family planning centre for a regular checkup or contraceptive advice between January 1991 and December 1993. RESULTS The programme showed a global effectiveness rate of 80%, with a reduction in prevalence from 5.1% in 1990 to 1.0% in 1993. A significant fall was observed in all the categories analyzed, except for women using prophylactics and those with higher education. CONCLUSIONS The programme achieves its objectives very effectively. Nevertheless, it would be advisable to evaluate its efficiency together with a cost-analysis, since by reducing prevalence, the positive estimated value of the test considerably decreases, which raises the cost of a single case detection.</dc:description>
