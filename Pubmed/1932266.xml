<dc:description xml:lang="en">A pilot Toxoplasma survey was conduct in Ciego de Avila province during the month of September, 1985, to assess, in practice, the methodologic structure proposed for the National Toxoplasma Survey. Of the 292 listed individuals, 284 were surveyed during the field work phase (97.2%) and the remaining 2.8% of no response was due mainly to the fact that dwellers were not at home during the visit. The best day for this type of survey resulted to be Sunday, in the morning. No difficulty was noted with the used modelling, and results obtained in the application of used techniques and procedures are appropriate for use in the National Toxoplasma Survey. The prevalence rate of anti- Toxoplasma antibodies was 55.9%. There was a significant association between some risk factors such as: living with cats, ingestion of non potable water and ingestion of raw meat.</dc:description>
