<dc:description xml:lang="en">This article corresponds to the final paper accepted as passing as a requirement to accede to the level of 500 hours in the "IDER" Masters program "Methodology of Research and Investigation in Healthcare" as part of a correspondence course designed by the University of Alcalá with backing from the University of Antioquía in Colombia. The pain which occurs as a response to an intravenous injection of Propofol is one of the main obstacles to its use as an anesthetic. The wide range of uses of propofol increases the desire to minimize this inconvenience. This study compares the occurrences of pain and the injection of propofol in three groups: the first group was administered propofol without any additives; the second group was administered propofol along with 20 mg of lidocaine; the third group had 40 mg of lidocaine added to the calculated doses of propofol. This study concluded that the addition of lidocaine significantly reduced the pain felt in the circulatory tract selected for the injection of propofol. Administering 20 or 40 mg of lidocaine did not produce any differences in the analgesic effect of this anesthetic.</dc:description>
