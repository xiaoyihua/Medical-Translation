<dc:description xml:lang="en">The development of medical education during colonial times was slow due to problems analyzed elsewhere. In 1833, the first Medical School of the Republic was founded at the National Institute. The first four physicians graduated in 1842. The University of Chile was founded on november 19; 1842, Andres Bello being its first Rector. Medicine was among the first 5 Faculties. Two Chileans, Luis Ballester and Francisco Javier Tocornal and 6 foreigners, the Britishmen Thomas Armstrong, Nathaniel Cox, Juan Blest and Guillermo Blest and the Frenchmen Lorenzo Sazie and Julio Lafargue were the first Faculty members. Sazie was named Dean in 1943 with Tocornal as Secretary. A new curriculum was developed in 1845. The University of Chile and its Faculty of Medicine, as state supported non confessional and national institutions have played a fundamental role in the cultural and medical development of the country. Graduates from these institutions were instrumental in the development of social medicine during the XXth century.</dc:description>
