<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The enzyme telomerase regulates telomere length by synthesis of telomeric repeats to compensate for telomeric loss in each DNA replication cycle. Therefore, telomerase is a potential target to block growth of cells with high replication rates. In Plasmodium falciparum, telomerase activity has been documented, but little information on its structure and role. METHODS Herein, alignment of multiple sequences was undertaken comparing telomerase catalytic subunit sequences as found in existing databases. A consensus sequence was compared with the sequences in the P. falciparum genome project and as a result, a candidate sequence for a portion of the telomerase gene was recovered. Primer sets were designed for DNA and RNA amplifications. RESULTS DNA fragments corresponding to telomerase conserved domains were amplified by using reverse transcription and PCR of cDNA. With a combination of bioinformatics and sequencing methods, the sequence of telomerase catalytic subunit gene (TERT) in P. falciparum was discovered, and its presence and transcription demonstrated.</dc:description>
