<dc:description xml:lang="en">Malnutrition in elderly people is one of the major syndromes associated to greater prevalence of chronic diseases and increased morbidity, hospital staying, and mortality. On the other hand, malnutrition in the fourth world is associated to another important risk factor, which is the poor economic status. The aim of this study was to elaborate a balanced menu for the elderly adjusting its price to the mean expense that this population dedicates to its feeding needs. Taking into account the Household expense for 2010 of the National Institute of Statistics, we established that the average price for each menu ought to be less than 5.57 € per day. Two type menus were elaborated, both adapted to this population and to the Mediterranean diet. The economic assessment was 5.02 € and 5.06 €, respectively. Given the prevalence of malnutrition in this population, it is essential being able to appropriately plan their feeding needs, at both the nutritional and economic levels.</dc:description>
