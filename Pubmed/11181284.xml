<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Osteoporotic fractures represent an important clinic and socioeconomic problem. Although it is well known the incidence of fractures in Spain, we do not know how many persons are at risk. The World Health Organization (WHO) has approved a densitometric criteria to define osteopenia (OSPE) and osteoporosis (OSP). The aim of this study has been to evaluate the prevalence of OSP and OSPE in women of the Spanish population. SUBJECTS AND METHOD With the data of a study of bone mass in the Spanish population, stratified according to age, using dual-energy X-ray absortiometry (DXA) with a QDR/1000 Hologic device and according the WHO criteria, we have calculated the prevalence of OSP and OSPE in normal Spanish women at the lumbar spine (LS) and/or femoral neck (FN). RESULTS The prevalence of osteoporosis at LS is: 0.34% in the group aged 20-44 years; 4.31% in the group aged 45-49 years; up to 9.09% in the group aged 50-59 years; 24.29% in the 60-69 years, and 40.0% in the group aged 70-79 years. The overall prevalence of osteoporosis is 11.13%, confidence interval (CI) 95% from 9.4 to 12.8%. The prevalence of osteoporosis at FN is: 0.17% in the group aged 20-44 years, 0% in the 45-49 years, up to 1.3% in the 50-59 years, 5.71% in the 60-69 years and 24.24% in the group aged 70-79 years. The overall prevalence of osteoporosis is 4,29% (CI 95% 3.2-5.4%). The prevalence in female older than 50 years was 22.8% at LS and 9.1% at FN. 12.73% of Spanish women population has osteoporosis at LS or FN, which represent about 1,974,400 women; 2.68% of total population has osteoporosis in both sites. CONCLUSIONS Even we do not include in this study women with established osteoporosis (with fractures), the number of Spanish women with osteoporosis is very high.</dc:description>
