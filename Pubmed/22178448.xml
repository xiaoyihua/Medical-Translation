<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of an educational program implemented before liver transplant on improving understanding at hospital discharge after the transplant and examine the contribution of different demographic and clinical variables on the level of knowledge. METHODS A quasi-experimental study with a non-equivalent control group undertaken at the Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic and Transplant Unit of Carlos Haya Regional University Hospital, Malaga, Spain. Sampling was consecutive (non-probabilistic), with a sample size of 31 patients for each group. An educational program was designed, encompassing the following Nurse Intervention Classification (NIC): Teaching: disease process; Teaching: prescribed diet; Education: prescription drugs; Protection against infection; Management of Hyperglycaemia; Management of Hypoglycaemia. For the outcome variable, a knowledge questionnaire was designed, with a total score range between 5-30 points, structured according to 6 indicators for Nurse Outcomes Classification (NOC): Description of the disease process, Description of the medication prescribed, Description of the prescribed diet, Description of self-care responsibilities, Description of practices that reduce transmission, Identification of actions to take in relation to blood glucose. RESULTS The study included 61 patients, 33 for the control group and 28 for the intervention group. The mean score on the questionnaire of the intervention group was 20.25 ± 2.8 and that of the control group 13.06 ± 3.51 points. The difference between the two groups was 7.19 (95% CI: 5.73-8.64; P&lt;.01). The analysis of the indicators showed that there were significant differences between the study groups, except for the indicator identification of actions to take in relation to blood glucose. No demographic or clinical variable (sex, education level, primary caregiver, waiting list time, time in hospital unit, hospital stay and days since the last talk before the transplant (only in intervention group)) was significantly associated with level of knowledge. CONCLUSION This educational program conducted at Carlos Haya hospital in patients on the liver transplant waiting list improved their knowledge after their transplant.</dc:description>
