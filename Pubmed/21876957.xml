<dc:description xml:lang="en">This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. The sample consisted of 235 nurses from two intensive care units in Porto (Portugal). The purpose of this study was to identify stressors for nurses working in intensive care units. The data was collected using the following: i) a questionnaire (for socio-demographic variables, physical aspects of work and variables related to the work context; ii) Interpersonal Work Relations Scale; iii) Nurse Stress Index. Nurses in the early phase of their career have higher stress levels (X = 81). An inadequate physical work structure leads to higher stress levels (X = 83). The worse the interpersonal relations are, the higher stress levels nurses feel (Spearman correlation coefficient =-0.331). Nurses who have a bad relationship with their work superiors view the dimension "Support and Organizational Involvement" as a stressor (Student's t test, p&lt;0.001).</dc:description>
