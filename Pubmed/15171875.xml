<dc:description xml:lang="en">Respect for human rights goes beyond the concept of reproductive health. The right to a responsible, satisfactory and safe sex life and the right to choose the number of children means that we must also concern ourselves with such concepts as fertility, unwanted pregnancy and assisted reproduction. Spain has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, with 1.24 children per woman. Data from a recent national survey showed that 7.2% of Spanish women are at risk for an unwanted pregnancy, either due to failure to use contraceptive measures or to use of poorly efficient measures. The abortion ratio, which has been increasing since 1992, was about 7 per 1000 women in 2001. On the other hand, although more and more couples are consulting with problems of sterility, the public health services do not appear to be covering their requirements.</dc:description>
