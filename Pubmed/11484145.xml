<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE Our aim is to assess the effectiveness and possible use od a new gel formulation for a LAT solution in minor lacerations repair and to propose its use for daily practice in surgical repair of skin lacerations near ocular structures like eyelids, eyebrows or forhead. METHOD Fifty patients presenting skin lacerations of various origins and locations complying with inclusion criteria were topically anesthesized using LAT gel previous to suturing. Concentrations in final gel solution were as follows: Tetracaine 1.0%. Lidocaine 1.5% and Adrenaline 0.1%. Effectiveness of anaesthesia was assessed by means of various pain evaluation scales filled by patients and physician. RESULTS Lidocaine infiltration was performed if any sign of pain was observed. 277 sutures were performed. Lidocaine infiltration was needed in five patients (10%) all of those evidencing lacerations in hands or fingers; no laceration in any facial area nor scalp needed any supplementary lidocaine infiltration. Of the total 254 sutures not needing infiltration, 19 (7.49%) elicited a painful response. 97% of all sutures placed in face and scalp elicited a less painful response and this difference was statistically significant against locations other than head. An average dose of 0.82 ml. of LAT was used in our study (consisting in 12.3 mg of Lidocaine, 8.2 mg of Tetracaine an 0.82 mg of Adrenalin). CONCLUSION LAT gel is an effective alternative for the repair of wounds needing minor surgical procedures, it provides anaesthesia for lacerations in face and scalp of children and adults.</dc:description>
