<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Breast cancer is a general health problem that annually produces 400,000 deaths worldwide. Its early diagnosis leads to high cure rates; nevertheless, in Mexico City this happens rarely. Her2-Neu is an oncogene that is expressed on breast cancer cells, with aggressive behaviour and metastasis. In the United States 20 to 30% of the patients present an over-expression of this protein. This phenomenon has been used as a prognostic parameter and as a predictive and indication factor for therapy with monoclonal antibodies directed against this protein and for therapy with taxanes. OBJECTIVE To know the biology and distribution of Her2-Neu expression in Mexican breast cancer patients in order to evaluate its potential as a prognostic and predictive factor in the treatment of the breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHOD In the cases of invasive ductal adenocarcinomas of the breast we compared by immunohistochemistry the Her2-Neu and estrogen receptor expressions with the histopathological characteristics. The results were evaluated statistically. RESULTS We found 122 cases of breast adenocarcinoma, from which we evaluated 108 for fulfilling the selection criteria of invasive ductal adenocarcinoma. Patient's mean age was 51.8 +/- 13.2 years. The mean tumour diameter was 3.5 +/- 2.0 cm and the mean number of lymph nodes with metastasis was 6.8. The Her2-Neu (score 2+ and 3+) expression was found in 36.1% of the patients. The tumour diameter and the presence of metastatic disease had strong relation with the Her2-Neu expression level. We did not find correlation with the differentiation level, the patient's age and the presence or absence of oestrogen receptors. CONCLUSIONS Since the percentage of patients with Her2-Neu expression is high (36.1%) and there is a close relation between Her2-Neu expression, the tumour size and the presence of lymph node methastasis, the determination of the oncoprotein expression could allow a more detailed prognosis and the treatment with immunotherapy and anthracyclines in order to influence the course of the breast cancer cases.</dc:description>
