<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE An evaluation is made of lung function and quality of life 6 months after discharge from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) among survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1, based on studies of lung function and the EQ-5D health questionnaire. DESIGN Case series. SETTING The ICU of Dr. Leónidas Lucero Acute Cases Municipal Hospital, Bahía Blanca, Argentina. PATIENTS PATIENTS discharged from the ICU who had been admitted with ARDS in 2009 due to influenza A H1N1. RESULTS Eleven patients were studied. Seven were positive for influenza H1N1 and four were negative. The mean age was 37±9.5 years, and 73% were males. Quality of life, as measured by the EQ-5D, showed changes in the 5 components in all patients, particularly in the pain/discomfort dimension 1.55±0.52; health status (EQ%health) was 70%±24. The indices adjusted for Argentina were Time Trade Off (TTO) 0.903±0.085 and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 0.827±0.153. In all patients, spirometry and the study of pulmonary diffusion (DLCO) showed values of &gt;80%. There was no correlation between lung diffusion and quality of life (%DLCO and EQ%health). A correlation was observed between quality of life and TTO (EQ%health and TTO), and between quality of life and the VAS score (EQ%health and VAS). CONCLUSION Although the sample is small, our results suggest that patients with ARDS due to influenza A H1N1 evaluated 6 months after discharge from the ICU show no deterioration of lung function, and the impact on quality of life is moderate-in contrast to the situation found in patients with ARDS of other etiologies.</dc:description>
