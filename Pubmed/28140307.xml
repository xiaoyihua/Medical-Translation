<dc:description xml:lang="en">Herpes zoster (HZ) is caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus. Its main risk factor is increasing age and comorbidities. There are limited data on the characteristics of HZ in South America, especially in the elderly. We analyzed epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 340 patients over 60 years assisted for HZ, between June 2013 and May 2014. The average age was 74 years (60-100), 62% (210) had thoracic location; 75% (255) of the initial consultations were held in guards; 68% (143) had pain and vesicles, and 4% (14) only pain at baseline. Pain persisted after finishing the episode in 41% (139). The diagnosis was made between 1 and 3 days from the beginning of the episode in 53% (180 patients). Average number of visits per episode was 3.6 (1-24). Antiviral treatment was supplied to 91% (309); however it was inadequate in dose or time in 49.1% (167 cases). Pain treatment was indicated in 66% (224). Most frequently used drugs (alone or in combination) were non-steroidal painkillers (43%, 146), pregabalin (30%, 102), opiates (24%, 82), and steroids (12%, 41); 9% (31) presented comorbidities; 27% (126) experienced pain after the ending of the episode, with an average duration of 138.7 days. In general, diagnosis was done late, making it difficult to use antivirals correctly. The presence of pain was more frequent than reported in other publications, however there are few data in this age group.</dc:description>
