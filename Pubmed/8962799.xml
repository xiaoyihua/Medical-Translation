<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Prognosis of hepatoblastoma in children has improved in the last few years particularly because of preoperative chemotherapy and total surgical removal. The aim of this study was to present the evolution of HB therapy at our centre. Since 1966, 44 patients have been treated. The first 20 cases (group I) were treated with chemotherapy alone. The next 19 patients (1975-1989) (group II) underwent preoperative chemotherapy and delayed surgery. After 1990, 5 patients (group III) were treated with protocolized preoperative chemotherapy and accurate surgery (SIOPEL-1). RESULTS survival rates for the three groups were: 0%, 15% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS HB differs from hepatocellular carcinoma pathologically and in onset of symptoms and prognosis. SIOPEL-1 results showed that preoperative chemotherapy aids tumour involution and therefore facilitates resectability and that accurate surgical technique permits safe removal of huge masses. Acceptance of these pillars for treatment of HB is currently essential for paediatric surgeons.</dc:description>
