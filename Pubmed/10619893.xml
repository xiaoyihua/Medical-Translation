<dc:description xml:lang="en">We have made a prospective study of the patients who were analysed for the first time at the Outpatients Department in the Otolaryngology Section of the University Complex Hospital of Santiago de Compostela all along 1997. A whole of 1,050 patients have been included in this study. The most frequent diagnosis were neurosensorial hypoacusis (29.1%), chronic otitis media (27.8%) and in the third place, otosclerosis. This appeared in 83 cases, which represents a 8.7% of the fulfilled diagnosis. The incidence for our health area reached 19 new cases of otosclerosis per 100,000 inhabitants a year. When only the number of stapedectomies were included, it reached a 7.8%. The prevalence of the female population was clear, reaching a 77%. Diagnosed patients' age was from 30 to 50 years, although a considerable percentage (37%) were older. The incidence reached by our studies is higher to other values previously published. We think this responds to the fact that the health system covers all the population and to the importance a good audition is given nowadays.</dc:description>
