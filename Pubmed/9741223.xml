<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE Prognostic factors in low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (LGL) are not well established. The aim of this study is to investigate prognostic factors on LGL treated in our institution during the last decade. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study was carried out on 70 cases of newly diagnosed LGL, most treated with CVP or clorambucil and prednisone. The median follow-up was 37 months (1-132). Variables reported as prognostic factors in previous series were subjected to bivariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS Relevant clinical features were: Ann Arbor III-IV stage 74%, ECOG &gt; or = 2-17%, bone marrow involvement 60% and large tumor burden according to MD Anderson criteria 21%. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 50% and partial response in 29%. In bivariate analysis factors related with poor CR were B symptoms, large tumor burden, high LDH and more than one extranodal site involvement. Logistic regression showed that large tumor burden (p = 0.02; OR = 0.07) and B symptoms (p = 0.07; OR = 0.14) were the best prognostic factors of poor CR. Five year global survival (GS) was 55%, with a median of 76 months. In univariate analysis factors related with GS were ECOG &gt; or = 2, B symptoms, bulky, large tumor burden, retroperitoneo involvement and absence of CR. In multivariate analysis the only factor related with poor GS was large tumor burden (p &lt; 0.00001; RR = 5.93). When therapeutic response was included in the model, absence of CR (p = 0.008; RR = 3.40) and large tumour burden (p = 0.005; RR = 3.86) were the factors selected. CONCLUSIONS In LGL tumor burden was the most important prognostic variable. Tumor response showed less importance than in high grade lymphomas.</dc:description>
