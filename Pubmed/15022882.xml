<dc:description xml:lang="en">Sixty female Wistar rats were employed and divided into three experimental groups of 20 rats each. Groups were evaluated at 15, 30, and the last at 45 days after surgery. Each group was divided into four sets of five rats each. All rats were subjected to surgery; an incision of 2 x 2 cm was done on the back of each animal, removing tissue until reaching muscular fascia, where the material was applied. Nitro-furazone was employed as positive control. Test materials were AlPO added with 0.55% wt of Zn; 0.30% wt of Ca(OH)2, and AlPO added with 0.55% wt of Zn and 0.66% wt of Ca(OH)2. Finally, as negative control no material was used. The object of this work was in the first place obtension of test materials and to evaluate the healing skin process in rats using AlPO enriched with Zn and Ca(OH)2; as indicated previously. Obtained materials were characterized employing XRD. Histologic studies tested showed that best healing process of dermal tissue corresponded to rats treated with AlPO added with 0.55% wt of Zn and 0.30% wt of Ca(OH)2. Use of AlPO ceramics to repair skin has not been reported previously.</dc:description>
