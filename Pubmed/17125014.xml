<dc:description xml:lang="en">Incident reporting schemes collect information on adverse events, errors, complications, or problems with the aim of analyzing their causes and suggesting changes to prevent recurrence. Such schemes are currently part of clinical safety programs in various countries. Although the ideal form for a reporting system is debated, an essential part of its success will be the establishment of a culture of safety within an organization. The underlying assumption is that even though errors are an inherent part of a process that relies on human beings, they are nearly always favored by a chain of system failures. Therefore, reporting is intended to stimulate a culture of learning rather than assigning blame. The main limitations of such schemes are under reporting, the use of different terms and concepts, the lack of resources for research and development, and the scarcity or lack of legislation to guarantee the proper use of information without legal consequences.</dc:description>
