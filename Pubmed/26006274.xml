<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Symptoms/signs suggestive of coagulopathy is a frequent complaint in Pediatric Hematology units. Both the clinical and family history are essential for diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective and descriptive study of patients referred to a Pediatric Hematology unit of a tertiary hospital for possible coagulopathy during 2012. RESULTS A total of 47 children were studied, of whom 61.7% had not previously suffered bleeding. The most frequent reason for referral was an eloganted activated partial thromboplastin time without any hemorrhage (42.5%), of these, 25% were diagnosed of a coagulopathy with a real risk of bleeding. While patients referred due to an eloganted activated partial thromboplastin time with bleeding more frequently (41.7%) have a coagulopathy with a real risk of bleeding. Children with a family history of bleeding are diagnosed more frequently with a coagulopathy with a real risk of bleeding: 37.5% (family history) vs. 14.3% (without). The most frequent diagnoses were: healthy children (48.9%), von Willebrand type 1 disease (19.1%), factor xii deficiency (19.1%), factor xi deficiency (4.2%), prekalikrein/high molecular weight kininogen deficiency (2.1%), acquired deficiency of factor x (2.1%), and factor ix deficiency (2.1%). CONCLUSIONS A thorough personal and family bleeding history and physical examination are the first steps for a correct differential diagnosis. The reason for referral should be based more on clinical bleeding and not just on an abnormal coagulation time. The most frequent diagnoses were type 1 von Willebrand disease and factor xii deficiency.</dc:description>
