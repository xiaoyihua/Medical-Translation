<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Complex regional pain syndrome is characterized by spontaneous or induced pain disproportionate in relation to the initial event and is accompanied by a variety of regional and motor disturbances, leading to a variety of clinical presentations. It is often associated with surgery and minor trauma. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Three mechanisms are postulated: changes secondary to post traumatic inflammation, peripheral vasomotor dysfunction and structural and functional changes of the central nervous system as a result of maladaptation. DIAGNOSIS made based on the criteria of Budapest. The patient must have one symptom and sign of each criterion at diagnosis: Continuing pain, disproportionate to any inciting event. A sensory, vasomotor, oedema and motor/trophic change sign and symptoms that are not explained by another diagnosis or cause. TREATMENT Multimodal treatment is suggested. There is no gold standard. In early stage NSAIDs or steroids can be used. Drugs used for neuropathic pain treatment have been suggested, but there is not enough evidence for any of these. There is low evidence that bisphosphonates, calcitonin, ketamine and mirror therapy are effective compared to placebo. Interventional treatment should be stepped from epidural block, neurostimulation, intrathecal pump to experimental therapies in case of intractable pain. DISCUSSION Although complex regional pain syndrome has been a recognized entity for over 100 years, no clear evidence exists for first-line treatments; however, new technologies that are applicable in complex regional pain syndrome treatment have been developed.</dc:description>
