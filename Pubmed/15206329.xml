<dc:description xml:lang="en">It is increasingly necessary that the neurologists achieve basic knowledgement in clinical management and medical care quality. We will review the concepts of medical care quality (MCQ). Of the definitions checked, we want to emphasize the following aspects. a) application of current scientific knowledge; b) interpersonal relationship; c) environment where the assistance is dispensed; d) results in health; e) cost of assistance; f) risks for the patient and g) patient satisfaction. For the analysis of the MCQ we could distinguish several components: scientific-technical component, efficacy, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility, continuity, equity, appropriateness, and satisfaction of the patient and of the professional. One of the main objectives to measure the MCQ is to improve the assistance itself. For its measurement we can employ diverse methods depending on our objective: to improve the process, to do Benchmarking, to know the satisfaction of the patients or to guarantee the quality of the medical attention. The most used tools for this measurement are: establishment of criteria-indicator-standard for quality, elaboration of satisfaction questionnaires, interviews to key informant, analysis of complaints and claims of patients and professionals, and clinical audits. The role of the neurologist in the achievement of a high quality neurological attention if fundamental. Therefore, it is necessary some specific formation on: scientific and technical matter, communicative abilities, teamworking, management and organisation of tasks and pharmaco-economic evaluation, and a cultural change that involves every professional on the co-responsibility of the continuous improvement of the processes and of the results of his work, advancing gradually towards the excellence of medical assistance.</dc:description>
