<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Determine whether the overexpression p53, MIB-1 and PECAM-1 of protein levels is of interest in predicting the prognosis of transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (TCC-UUT) with the primary seat in the renal pelvis. MATERIAL AND METHOD A univariate and multivariate analysis was conducted for prognosis prediction in a series of 82 patients with TCC-UUT of the renal pelvis who had no metastases at diagnosis (N0/Nx M0) and were treated exclusively with nephroureterectomy. We assessed clinicopathological parameters (age, gender, tumor grade and extent, histological variety, growth pattern, vascular invasion, infiltration of the renal parenchyma, tumor necrosis) and the immunohistochemical expression of p53, MIB-1 (ki-67) and PECAM-1 (CD31) in sections performed with tissue microarray (TMA). RESULTS A total of 47.6% of the patients had high-grade lesions according to the USIP-WHO classification. The growth pattern was flat in 15.85%. The distribution by T category was: 3.7% pTa, 51.2% pT1, 11% pT2, 29.3% pT3 and 4.9% pT4. The mean follow-up was 46.8+38.5 (range, 4-172) months. The median survival was reached at 57 (95% CI 44-63) months. The univariate analysis revealed that survival in these patients is associated with tumor size (P=.028), histological variety (P&lt;.0001), growth pattern (P&lt;.0001), grade (P&lt;.0001), pT (P=.01), vascular invasion (P=.025), necrosis (P=.004) and overexpression of p53 (P=.0006), PECAM-1 (P=.0036) and MIB-1 (P=.0038). The Cox regression model showed that high-grade (HR, 4.2; 95% CI 1.28-13.79; P=.018), flat growth pattern (HR, 2.52; 95% CI 1.05-6.03; P=.038) and p53 overexpression (HR, 2.8; 95% CI 1.22-6.44; P=.015) were independent predictors. CONCLUSION Histological grade, tumor growth pattern and p53 overexpression were established as the primary predictors of prognosis for primary TCC-UUT of the renal pelvis. The independent value of MIB-1 observed in other studies was not reproduced in this study.</dc:description>
