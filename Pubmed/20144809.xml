<dc:description xml:lang="en">Malaria is a preventable and curable disease. The risk zones are those tropical and subtropical regions of the countries with endemic malaria. These countries are visited by 125 million international tourists yearly and it is estimated that up to 30,000 fall sick with malaria. Prevention is done by: preventing transmission (using mosquito repellent, mosquito nets, etc.) and by preventing the disease by chemoprophylaxis. The latter aims to reduce the risk of suffering severe malaria, basically that produced by P. falciparum. It consists in the administration of antimalaria drugs before, during and after the trip. The choice of antimalaria drug will depend on the individual factors (allergies, contraindications, etc.) and mainly on the resistance of P. falciparum to these drugs. In areas with sensitivity to chloroquine, this should be the drug of choice and in those with resistances, three drugs have been recommended by both the CDC and WHO: Atovaquone/proguanil, Doxycycline and Mefloquine.</dc:description>
