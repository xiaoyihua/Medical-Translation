<dc:description xml:lang="en">Anoxic encephalopathy is the consequence of acute cerebral oxygen deprivation usually generated by cardiac arrest and/or respiratory failure. Recently an interesting case of one patient with cerebral anoxia after ultraviolet radiation session has been published. This paper shows the clinical evolution of this patient after inclusion in a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program, which included treatment of the psychopathological, neuropsychological and functional impairments that this pathology often generates. Over successive decades cerebral anoxia has come to be identified principally as one of the most significant causes of an isolated amnesia syndrome. Our patient presented at baseline intense difficulties in every verbal and visual memory processes associated with moderate impairments in sustained, selective and shifting attention as well as temporal disorientation. Compensation of memory deficit was the main rehabilitation strategy used in this case. This rehabilitation approach was possible thanks to the high degree of self-awareness of memory deficits shown by the patient and the selective impairment of memory with partial preservation of the rest of cognitive functions. This particular case gives us the opportunity to show the multidisciplinary approach of cognitive rehabilitation and the process of reintegration to social activities and to productive work even when deficits persist.</dc:description>
