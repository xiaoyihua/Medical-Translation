<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Primary health care is considering the cornerstone of health care in Chile. Its efficiency is strongly influenced by the quality and competences of physicians that are responsible for health care at this level. AIM To define the features and competences that should have primary care physicians. MATERIAL AND METHODS A group of experts that could be physicians or other professionals working in primary health care were invited to answer electronically a structured questionnaire containing a list of 71 competences, for a basic and an expert level of physician, using the Delphi method. Competences were classifying as "desirable" or "indispensable". If there was lack of consensus in the importance given to a specific competence, the researchers defined its importance. RESULTS Thirty-eight professionals (50% physicians) were inviting to participate and 16 answered the questionnaire. The competence profile defined for basic physicians has 13 knowledge items, 24 skills and 16 attitudes. The figures for advanced physicians are 29 knowledge items, 37 skills and 20 attitudes. CONCLUSIONS This list of competences should been considered by medical schools to adapt undergraduate training of future physicians.</dc:description>
