<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Our goal was to know the osteopenia and osteoporosis prevalence, determined by densitometry using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure the bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A total the 202 postmenopausal women aged 37 at 74 years old was studied, at the Gynecologist and Obstetrics Hospital No. 3 Medical Center "La Raza" from the IMSS, initiated in December 2001 to June 2002. The measurement BMD using DXA with a LUNAR device and according the WHO criteria, we have calculated the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in normal postmenopausal women at the lumbar spine (LS) and/or femoral neck (FN). RESULTS The osteopenia prevalence in LS was: 18.2% in the group aged 45-49 years old, 47.1% in the group aged 50-54, 43.7% in the group aged 55-59, 63.6 in the group aged 60-64, 53% in the group aged 65-69, and 30% in the group aged 70-74. The overall osteopenia prevalence in LS was 43.5%, confidence interval (CI) 95% from 43.08 to 44.03%. The osteoporosis of LS was 17.1% in the group aged 50-54 years old; 21.8 in the group aged 55-59; 22.7 in the group aged 60-64; 35.29% in the group aged 65-69; and 30% in the group aged 70-74. The overall osteoporosis prevalence in the LS was 19.8% (CI) 95% from 14.3 to 25.2%. The osteopenia prevalence in FN was. 19% in the group aged 45-49 years old; 40% in the group aged 50-54; 49% in the group aged 55-59; 54% in the group aged 60-64; 76% in the group aged 65-69 and 60% in the group aged 70-74. The overall osteopenia prevalence of FN was the 48% CI 95% from 40.65-54.59%. The osteoporosis prevalence in FN: 2.38% in the group aged 45-49 years old; 7.14 in the group aged 50-54; 5.45% in the group aged 55-59; 13.6% in the group aged 60-64; 5.8 in the group aged 65-69, and 20% in the group aged 70-74. The overall osteoporosis prevalence in FN was 7.4% IC 95% from 3.6-10.68%. CONCLUSIONS The osteoporosis prevalence in this group is less than between American women (15%), and early detection is possible between women with BMD low, in the postmenopausal women with high risk factors and primary treatment need to be established and implemented.</dc:description>
