<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) throughout 24 hours has been introduced for clinical practice, improving the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. However, there is not an agreement concerning how often the blood pressure have to be measured. SUBJECTS AND METHODS An ABPM was performed in 29 normotensive and hypertensive subjects (16-73 years) throughout 24 hours recording the blood pressure every 15 minutes. The average of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of the diurnal and nocturnal periods of the interval of 15 minutes, were compared with the two intervals of 30 minutes and the four of 60 minutes, according to Bland and Altman method. RESULTS Between 90% and 100% of the differences of the interval 15 minutes versus 30 minutes, and 15 minutes versus 60 minutes, were within +2 and -2 standard deviation of the mean. However, only between 95% and 100% of the difference of the intervals 15 minutes versus 30 minutes were within the limits of agreement for systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the nocturnal period. CONCLUSIONS A clinical satisfactory information using ABPM can be obtained monitoring the blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day and 30 minutes at night.</dc:description>
