<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Hospital mortality is a indicator of quality of care, and their study may improve assistance of hospitalized patients. Our objective was to know the most frequent death causes of hospitalized patients, to identify clinical and analytical variables associated with each cause, and to determine gender differences. MATERIAL AND METHODS A systematic and retrospective revision of 113 medical reports of death patients was carried out; it corresponded 26% of all deaths occurred between March 2002 to November 2004. At each case, epidemiological variables, previous clinical reports, biochemical and haematological parameters, death cause and in-hospital complications were registered. RESULTS Mean age was 79 +/- 10 years and 58.4% of cases were males. Thirty eight percent had previous admission, and 45% had functional class III-IV. Men died with less age that women (76.6 +/- 10.3 versus 82.3 +/- 8.0 p &lt; 0.002) and they had more frequent antecedents of chronic bronchopulmonary disease (43% versus 19%, p &lt;0.04); however, women had worse ventilatory situation at admission. The main death causes were cardiopulmonary (56% whole, 34% because of respiratory insufficience, 14% because of pneumonia, and 8% because of acute lung oedema), followed by neurological causes (25% whole, 23% because of stroke) and 19% because another reason (neoplasia, multiorganic failure, hepatic insufficience and renal failure). Patients died from cardiopulmonary cause had a more frequent previous hospitalization (p &lt; 0.04). Patients died from neurological cause had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure at admission (p &lt; 0.0001), higher rate of hypertension (p &lt; 0.0001) and more frequent nosocomial fever (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS In our Service, male patients died with less age that women, the main death causes were cardiorespiratory diseases and subsequently neurologic diseases. Hypertension at admission was most frequent in patients died from neurologic cause.</dc:description>
