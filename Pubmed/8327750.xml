<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors evaluated the serological response of metronidazole, or 8823 RP-(Hydroxy-2' ethy1)-1-methyl-2 nitro-5 imidazole) in 1307 patients, with Chagas' disease in the acute or chronic stage with age ranging between 6 months to 73 years. 273 patients were in the acute phase: 153 children and 120 adults. Patients in the chronic stage were classified with serological, clinical and cardiological criteria: 1.-POSITIVE SEROLOGY without cardiological signs or symptomatology (EKG, VECTO, ECHO M mode and 2-D, Chest Rx, physiological and pharmacological tests, radiocardiological-HMIBI, MUGA); 2.- POSITIVE SEROLOGY with cardiological signs and symptoms (all cardiological tests were abnormals); 3.- POSITIVE SEROLOGY with cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure. Metronidazole, P.O. or I.V. was utilizing dosages ranging from 15 to 25 mg/Kilo body weight per five days in acute phase and 250 to 500 mg. P.O. in the chronic stage of the disease for 180 days. The drug was well tolerated by all patients in both phases of the disease. Adequate anabolic effect was identified in both stages of the illness. Serological reactions were negative in all patients (100%) without cardiomyopathy. In patients with cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure, the complement fixation test title were similar before and after treatment.</dc:description>
