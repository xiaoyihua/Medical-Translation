<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND METHODS The available data on the utility of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) in the secondary prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are limited. We compared two cohorts of patients diagnosed of DVT. One group followed treatment with LMWH and the other group did with oral anticoagulants (acenocoumarol). Safety was evaluated by the rate of major hemorrhage and 2.5-years period fracture rate, and efficacy was evaluated as the rate of early recurrence and one-year recurrence rate. RESULTS Of 65 patients treated with LMWH, the hemorrhagic rate was 1.5% (95% CI 0.08-9.40), fracture rate was 7.7% (95% CI 2.87-17.75), early recurrence was 1.5% (95% CI 0.08-9.40) and one-year recurrence was 3% (95% CI 53-11.64). In 118 patients treated with oral anticoagulants the hemorrhagic rate was 3.4% (95% CI 1.09-8.97), odds ratio 0.33, the fracture rate was 11% (95% CI 16.23-18.44), odds ratio 0.66, the early recurrence rate was 5% (95% CI 2.08-11.20), odds ratio 0.60 and one-year recurrence was 3.4% (95%CI 1.09-8.97), odds ratio 0.33. CONCLUSIONS Secondary prophylaxis of DVT with LMWH is as safe and effective as classical treatment with oral anticoagulants. In this study the 2.5-year period fracture rate was similar in both groups of treatment.</dc:description>
