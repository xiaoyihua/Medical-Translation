<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice in patients with end- stage renal disease. Renal transplantation in without fear of ethical conflicts is the best treatment option in the elderly. The objective is to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients over 60 years old with at least one year of renal transplantation in a single center of Colombia. METHODS This is a cohort study of patients over 60 years old from a single center in Bogota, Colombia. About 28 patients were analyzed between June 2004 and March 2012. RESULTS The mean age was 65 years old, with 89% males. The main cause of chronic kidney disease was diabetic nephropathy, followed by hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Most of them (96.4%) were deceased donor transplants with a mean age of 40 years old, cold ischemia time was 12 hours and there was a mismatch of 3.25 (± 1.29). Major comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and coronary arterial disease. Almost 17% had delayed graft dysfunction. Serum creatinine at 6 and 12 months was 1.27 mg/dl (± 0.31) and 1.25mg/dl (± 0.33), respectively. Only 10% of patients had acute cellular rejection. Humoral rejections were not documented. The patient survival at 1 year was 89.7%, and death-censored graft survival was 96.4%. The most frequent cause of death was acute myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS Proper selection of kidney transplant recipients shows satisfactory results in survival, with low morbidity in patients older than 60 years.</dc:description>
