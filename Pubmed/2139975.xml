<dc:description xml:lang="en">Up to the present time, it has not been possible to establish the exact role that the renin-angiotensin system plays in the development and persistence of arterial hypertension in human beings. The tissular renin-angiotensin systems which have been studied in different tissular locations, cerebral, cardiac, vascular, play a role which consists in regulating the regional blood flow, in conjunction with the sympathetic nervous system. The tissular renin-angiotensin systems would then act when the physio-pathological alteration which initially caused to the triggering of the general renin-angiotensin system persists after arterial blood pressure has returned to normal levels. Although renin blocking is, in theory, the most efficient method for checking the renin-angiotensin system, in practical terms, the best therapeutical option is still the inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme. However, the obtention of an active orally administered compounds capable of inhibiting renin synthesis or action must be considered as an accomplishment still to come. Similarly, the discovery of compounds which are analogous to the natriuretic atrial peptides, and can be administered enterally, also represent a prospect worth bearing in mind for the treatment of arterial hypertension. Since we are aware of the importance of vasodilating renal prostaglandins and modulipin in maintaining renal function in the various forms of arterial hypertension, what must still be established is the role played by these prostanoids in the physiopathology of arterial hypertension in human beings.</dc:description>
