<dc:description xml:lang="en">POEMS syndrome is characterized by Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal protein and Skin changes. We report a woman with the syndrome, who had peripheral polyneuropathy, osteosclerotic myeloma, monoclonal IgA elevation, hypothyroidism, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, adrenal insufficiency, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, thyroid and parotid enlargement, Castleman&#146;s disease, papilledema, stiff and hyperpigmented skin, white nails, clubbing, ascites and chronic diarrhea. She had also a nephropathy characterized by microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, renal insufficiency and a unilateral kidney retraction. She was treated with melphalan and prednisone, achieving remission of the disease and nephropathy. She survived twelve years and died due to a myocardial infarction 20 years after POEMS diagnosis.</dc:description>
