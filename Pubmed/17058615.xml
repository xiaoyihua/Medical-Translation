<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES To present the number of cases of hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy. This study evaluates our results and difficulties of starting a progresive programme of laparoscopy. MATERIAL AND METHOD Between november 2003 and november 2005, 35 hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomies were carried out, of a total of 45 laparoscopic nephrectomies. 22 radical nephrectomies, 3 simple nephrectomies and 10 nephroureterectomies. The average age of patients was 66 years (47-89). On average, they were overweight (IMC 28,3), with approximately 38% being obese. ASA 2.3 (1-4). The tumors measured 4.8cm on average, and 80% of these were T1. In 28.6% of the cases, they had previously undergone abdominal surgery. RESULTS One was undertaken in 2003, 17 in 2004, and 17 in 2005. The surgery time was 140 minutes, 130 minutes (80-210) in radical nephrectomies, 135 minutes (120-150) in simple nephrectomies and 163 minutes (80-240) in the nephroureterectomy. Patients began an oral diet 1.7 days later, and were able to get up 1.7 days later. In the case of obese patients, they began an oral diet 2.3 days later and were able to get up (2.4 days) later than those non obese cases. (1.5 and 1.4 days respectively). The average stay has been 5.8 days (3-15). The average stay of the cases without complications was 4.2 days and those that encountered complications 9.7 days. In no cases was there a need for a blood transfusion. In 11.4% we had major complications with an average stay of 11.7 days. In 5.7% of cases there were reconversions, and 5.7% of cases were reoperated. 17.1% had minor complications, with an average stay of 8.8 days CONCLUSIONS The advantage of hand-assisted nephrectomy is that it allows one to begin a laparoscopy, with a reduced learning time, and with satisfactory results, allowing the incorporation of laparoscopy surgery in hospitals with a reduced annual volume.</dc:description>
