<dc:description xml:lang="en">According to the literature, the use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection is safe and effective. There have been no reports, however, of primary infection with the hepatitis C virus during treatment with a biologic agent. We report the case of a patient with long-standing moderate to severe psoriasis who developed acute hepatitis C while being treated with etanercept. Biologic therapy was continued and the infection was successfully treated with pegylated interferon, which achieved a sustained virologic response. Etanercept did not have a negative impact on disease outcome or on response to antiviral treatment.</dc:description>
