<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Choledochal cysts are a rare anomaly of the biliary system; only 20-30% are diagnosed in adults. The etiology remains uncertain; however, many patients with this pathology have had an anomalous pancreatobiliary junction. AIM To evaluate recent trends regarding diagnosis and treatment of choledochal cysts. MATERIALS AND METHODS Review of the world literature was performed on the matter of choledochal cysts. Incidence, signs and symptoms at presentation, and diagnostic tools and therapeutics are discussed. Results of these authors are also reported. RESULTS Estimated incidence of choledochal cyst disease varies according to population studied. It is reported mainly in children; however, an increasing number of adult patients have been diagnosed with the disease. Symptoms are often unspecific and laboratory evaluation may demonstrate no variation. Ultrasonography (US) and cholangiography are both effective in defining biliary dilatation, but endoscopic retrograde colangiopancreatography (ERCP) and recently magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) have been evaluated and best visualize the pancreatobiliary junction. Treatment of choledochal cyst disease is surgical and does not depend on age of patient; nonetheless, reach patient should be properly evaluated. CONCLUSIONS Although choledochal cysts are typically diagnosed in infancy or childhood, the surgeon should not exclude the diagnosis because the patient is an adult. Cyst excision with hepaticojejunostomy is the definitive treatment of choice; nevertheless, surgical strategy should be selected based on type of cyst and the patient.</dc:description>
