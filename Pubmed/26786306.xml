<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In order to validly measure the oral health related quality of life in school age children it is necessary to adapt and validate the CPQ 11-14 for Spanish language. To confirm the four domains of CPQ-Esp 11-14 for the full and abbreviated version of 16 and 8 items. METHODS The instrument was translated into Spanish and culturally adapted. It was administered to 288 12 year-old children attending public schools. Dental caries experience was measure with the DMFT index. The conceptual structure of the scales was assessed by the AFC. It was also evaluated: internal consistency with Cronbach 's alpha, test- retest temporal stability with intraclass correlation coeficient, and concurrent validity with correlation of score CPQ-Esp 11-14 with caries experience. RESULTS The five measures used to confirm the structure of the factors on the version of 37 items showed values outside the range of the model fit. Version 16 and 8 items obtained indicators within values indicating the model fit. The internal consistency of full scale and versions 16 and 8 items were measured with Cronbach Alpha wich was higher than 0.6. All versions had intraclass correlation coefficient above 0.81, except for functional limitations of the subscale version a of 16 items. The Rho Spearman correlation was significant between CAOD and the score the questionnaire, except for oral symptoms and full version b version of 16 items. CONCLUSIONS The hypothetical factor structure was confirmed by the CFA for 16 and 8 items versions. The information contained in abbreviated items allows measuring oral health related quality of life in Chilean children.</dc:description>
