<dc:description xml:lang="en">A group of patients with Dermatophagoides allergy was estudy analyze the behavior of blocking antibodies (Ab E: total IgG, IgG1 and IgG4) directed against complete allergen extract (CE) and against the major allergens, Der pI and Der pII, and its relation with the clinical results of desensitizing treatment. A group of 36 patients received specific immunotherapy (IT) and conventional treatment alone. Over a 12-month period, four follow-up studies were made to evaluate the patient's clinical situation (symptom score) and to determine total IgG and IgG subclasses directed against CE, DER pI, and DER pII. In the group treated with IT, the levels of all IgG subclasses increased subjectively, but in the group without It, igG levels did not change. There was no significant improvement in ocular on pulmonary symptoms in either group. Nasal symptoms had a more favorable evolution in the IT group.</dc:description>
