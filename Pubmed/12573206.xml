<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To assess the existence of immunologic alterations, referring to IgG subclasses, in the respiratory allergic pathology in the childhood. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a prospective study that compares the IgG subclasses levels in a sample of patient with allergic breathing illness (n = 169) and a group control (n = 130) with ages range from one month to 13 years old. The statistical analysis includes a descriptive statistic and a comparative statistic carrying out comparison of means between both groups with the Welch test and the Student's T test. RESULTS The mean rate of IgG1 in the group with breathing allergic pathology being of 578,1 mg/dl and in the control group, being of 632,78 mg/dl. The mean rate of IgG2 in the group with breathing allergic pathology being of 106,12 mg/dl and in the control group, being of 142,38 mg/dl. The mean rate of IgG3 in the group with breathing allergic pathology being of 53,73 mg/dl and in the control group, being of 63,78 mg/dl. The children with breathing allergic pathology have significantly decreased IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 levels in comparison to the control group (p &lt; 0.001). The mean rate of IgG4 in the group with breathing allergic pathology being of 25,86 mg/dl and in the control group, being of 13,89 mg/dl. The children with breathing allergic pathology have significantly elevated IgG4 levels in comparison to the control group (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The findings obtained suggest that an relation exists in the breathing allergic processes with the IgG subclasses levels disturbances and also that there is an alteration of the immune response maturation in relation to subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3. The valuation of the levels of these immunoglobulins can be useful in the pathogenic diagnosis of the allergic processes.</dc:description>
