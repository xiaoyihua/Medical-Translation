<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Acute appendicitis is the more frequent no obstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy with an incidence of 1 in 1500 pregnancies. The clinical diagnosis is difficult because of the physiological changes of pregnancy itself. If not treated early increases the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity. OBJECTIVE To describe the diagnosis and treatment of four cases of acute appendicitis during pregnancy. CLINICAL CASE Four cases of acute appendicitis during pregnancy diagnosed in the period of a month. Gestational age at diagnosis of appendicitis was between 8 and 13 week. All patients underwent laparotomy; three cases were appendicitis phase II and one phase III. The preoperative was managed with indomethacin and ceftriaxone. There were no maternal or obstetric complications. CONCLUSIONS An early diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis during pregnancy, and a multidisciplinary approach between surgeon, obstetrician and anesthesiologist is the basis for success in the management of these patients.</dc:description>
