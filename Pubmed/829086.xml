<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors present the results of treatment with acetazolamide of gastroduodenal ulcer (356 gastric ulcer, 1.250 duodenal ulcers--859 with craters--, 24 pyloric stenosi with functional components, and 42 postgastrectomy peptic ulcers). The acetazolamide was administed in daily dosis of 25-30 mg/kg of body weight, sodium and potassium salts were added, and the liquid intake was increased (approx. 2 1 daily). A control was kept of the clinical, secretory, radiological, enzymological, and hydrolectrolytical modification. A decrease is observed of the in the carbonic anhidrase of the gastric mucosa and of the gastric secretion. There is also an increase in the gastric protection factors and a disappearance of ulcer pain. There are no significant hydroelectrolytic modifications of the blood. From a radiogical point of view, the crater of the postoperative gastric, pyloric and peptic ulcer disappears after 2 weeks of treatment, and in duodenal ulcers in 89% of the cases in 3 weeks. The method is the same time a quick, simple, an efficient therapeutic test for the differentiation of the gastric craters. The drug is well tolerated. Nevertheless a clinical, secretory and radiological control of the patients is necessary taking into account the counter-indication for the administration of acetazolamide.</dc:description>
