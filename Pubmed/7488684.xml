<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the results of a tobacco dependency clinic after 41 months functioning. DESIGN A descriptive and retrospective study. SETTING The tobacco dependency clinic of the Primary Care team at Sant Just Desvern. PARTICIPANTS 134 smokers who asked for an interview with the nurse in charge of the clinic were attended. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS 47.01% wanted to stop smoking: 66.42% anticipated difficulties in achieving this. Treatment was counter-indicated in 17.16% of the smokers. 57 people (42.54%) stopped smoking of whom 26 then restarted. 35 smokers (26.12%) cut down and 17 (12.69%) changed their attitude. CONCLUSIONS The clinic fulfilled its initial objective, but we must move towards a strategy of systematic intervention on all smokers within the general clinics.</dc:description>
