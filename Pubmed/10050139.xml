<dc:description xml:lang="en">Tobacco smoking is a strong independent factor for atherosclerotic disease, equivalent to hypertension or high cholesterol levels. Middle age people are especially involved, with a mortality rate of about 20% as a consequence of smoking, and a mean loss of life expectancy of 20 years. There is a positive correlation between smoking and severity of atherosclerotic disease in the coronary and cerebral arteries, and the aorta. It has been shown that smoking cessation clearly enhances the prognosis of patients with myocardial infarction. Twice a increase in mortality rate has been found among nonstopping smokers compared with those who stopped smoking eight years after myocardial infarction. In addition, progression of atherosclerosis as shown by angiography is slowed by stopping to smoke. As the coronary risk factors act in a synergistic way, a comprehensive approach to the patient is recommended, especially in smokers with myocardial infarction. It is justified an intensive intervention because of the advantages in this population. The physician should clearly communicate to the patient the need of stopping to smoke, which carries sometimes as beneficial effects as other interventions. A wise use of replacement therapy with transdermal nicotine, together with other useful measures, allows us to manage patients with a broad margin of safety, especially in coronary patients, who win most benefit from ceasing to smoke.</dc:description>
