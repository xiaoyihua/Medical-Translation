<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The characterization of clustering behavioral risk factors may be used as a guideline for interventions aimed at preventing chronic diseases. This study determined the clustering patterns of some behavioral risk factors in young adults aged 18 to 29 years and established the factors associated with having two or more of them. METHODS Patterns of clustering by gender were established in four behavioral risk factors (low consumption of fruits and vegetables, physical inactivity in leisure time, current tobacco consumption and acute alcohol consumption), in 1465 young adults participants through a multistage probabilistic sample. Regression models identified the sociodemografic variables associated with having two or more of the aforementioned behavioral risk factors. RESULTS Having one, 32.9% two and 17.7% three or four. Acute alcohol consumption was the risk factor most frequent in the combined risk factor patterns among males; physical inactivity during leisure time being the most frequent among females. Among the females, having two or more behavioral risk factors was linked to be separated or divorced, this having been linked to work having been the main activity over the past 30 days among males. CONCLUSIONS The combinations of behavioral risk factors studied and the factors associated with clustering show different patterns among males and females. These findings stressed the need of designing interventions sensitive to gender differences.</dc:description>
