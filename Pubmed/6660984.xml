<dc:description xml:lang="en">The usefulness of fluorimetric techniques in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was investigated. In the 63 cases studied during 25 years by measuring simultaneously various aminergic parameters, including plasma catecholamines and urinary adrenaline (A), noradrenaline (N) and vanilmandelic acid (VMA), we were able to establish the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in all cases. Adrenaline excretion was found to be higher in patients with tumors located on the adrenal region, whereas N excretion was predominantly increased in patients with extra-adrenal tumors. In patients having tumors smaller than 50 g, A + N excretion was higher and VMA was lower than in those whose tumors were heavier; therefore in cases with small tumors the ratio VMA/A + N was lower than in those with larger tumors. It is concluded that simultaneous measurements of PC, A, N and VMA allow the diagnosis to be made in the most patients with this tumor. On the other hand, the predominant increase in A excretion is suggestive of adrenal pheochromocytoma.</dc:description>
