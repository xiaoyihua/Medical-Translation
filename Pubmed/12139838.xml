<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present the results of a retrospective study of endoscopic management (with flexible endoscopy) in 501 patients admitted for suspected ingestion of a foreign body between 1977 and 1997. The mean age of the patients was 55.73 19.38. Foreign bodies were found in the esophagus in 322 patients (64.3%) and endoscopic removal was successful in 307 (95.35%). More experienced endoscopists, with more than 45 cases, had a higher success rate (98.1%) than did less experienced endoscopists (87.9%) (p &lt; 0.01). The most frequent type of foreign body in our series was meat bolus (32.8%). Underlying disease was found in 38.9%, and peptic stenosis was the most frequent. The only severe complication found was esophageal perforation in one patient (0.3%). Emergency flexible endoscopy is the most effective method for managing patients admitted for suspected ingestion of a foreign body and for the removal of foreign bodies located in the esophagus.</dc:description>
