<dc:description xml:lang="en">A 72-year-old woman diagnosed with critical descending aortic stenosis was scheduled for endovascular treatment by angioplasty and implantation of an aortic stent. Her medical history included arterial hypertension, lipid metabolic disorder, obesity, Takayasu disease, dermatopolymyositis, and alleged allergy to iodine contrast and local anesthetics. After the allergies were ruled out, it was decided to use a regional anesthetic technique to avoid the postoperative complications of general anesthesia and achieve better hemodynamic control during surgery. Surgery was carried out under epidural anesthesia and intravenous sedation. After angioplasty and during self-expansion of the stent, the patient's hemodynamics deteriorated rapidly; she lost consciousness and required orotracheal intubation and immediate resuscitation measures. The literature describes in detail the management of patients with thoracic aortic lesions, including the most appropriate way to provide anesthesia. General anesthesia seems to be preferred, although care is taken to individualize the decision. We analyze this case of a patient with severe thoracic aortic stenosis undergoing endovascular treatment under epidural anesthesia.</dc:description>
