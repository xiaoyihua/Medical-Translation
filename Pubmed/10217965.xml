<dc:description xml:lang="en">To assess the current incidence and meaning of left bundle-branch block associated with acute myocardial infarction we studied 1,239 patients consecutively admitted in three hospitals. Left bundle branch block was present in 42 cases (3.3%). Compared to the patients without left bundle-branch block, those with left bundle-branch block were older (70 +/- 8.8 versus 63.9 +/- 11.4 years; p &lt; 0.001), and had a more prevalent history of diabetes, angina, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Left bundle-branch block was associated more frequently with female gender and poor left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients with left bundle branch block were admitted with a longer interval from the onset of the symptoms (7.8 +/- 6.3 versus 5.4 +/- 6.7 hours; p &lt; 0.01) and received in a lesser rate thrombolytics agents (21% versus 56%; p &lt; 0.001), than those without left bundle-branch block. Complications significatively associated with left bundle-branch block were: complete AV block; heart failure and one-year mortality (40.4% versus 19.5%, p &lt; 0.01). Female gender, age and heart failure were independent predictors of mortality whereas left bundle-branch block was not. In conclusion, current incidence of left bundle-branch block in acute myocardial infarction is lower than that referred in the pre-thrombolytic era. Left bundle-branch block is accompanied by a low rate of thrombolysis, whereas a higher mortality rate of these patients seems to depend on their clinical characteristics.</dc:description>
