<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a surgical technique which has been adopted by otolaryngologists in the last years, because of the improvement in the endonasal approach by means of endoscopes. Although the results with the different techniques regarding permeability of the lacrimal duct are similar, we present some modifications in the surgical technique which contribute to a better postoperatory mucosal recovery, due to its more functional and less aggressive nature, improving the cost-benefit ratio. Two groups are compared, the first one (96 DCR) performing osteotomies with a chisel, without doing lacrimal duct and mucosa flaps, the second one (40 DCR) applying the modified technique using Smith-Kerrison forceps to perform osteotomies and creating lacrimal duct and mucosa flaps. Final results referred to permeability are similar (92.7% vs 87.5%). No major complications were found, and the most common minor complication was postoperative eyelid hematoma in cases of orbital fat exposure (5 cases vs 7 cases).</dc:description>
