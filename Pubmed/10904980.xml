<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To review current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and the tolerance of topirimate (TPM) and describe the Spanish experience of the use of this drug in 224 patients of all ages. DEVELOPMENT TPM is a new drug which affects practically all the mechanisms involved in the production of epileptic seizures, which means that it is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug. After reviewing the mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetic characteristics of TPM, we consider the efficacy of the drug in 224 patients of all ages with all types of epileptic seizures. CONCLUSIONS In patients of all ages with uncontrolled epileptic seizures treated with TPM, the frequency of their seizures was reduced by over 50% in 78% of the patients and the seizures were abolished in 25% of the total cases. The drug was generally well tolerated. Side-effects leading to suspension of the drug occurred in only 5% of the cases. TPM is an effective drug which is well tolerated in patients of all ages and with all kinds of epilepsy.</dc:description>
