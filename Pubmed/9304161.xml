<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Information on the management of acute myocardial infarction in Spain is still scarce. The Register of Acute Myocardial Infarction of Valencia City (RICVAL) was established to collect, in a prospectively and uniformly way, data of patients with acute myocardial infarctions discharged from Valencia coronary care units, in order to obtain updated information on the management of these patients. Data of the first twelve months of the register are presented. METHODS Using standardised variables, demographic, clinical, procedural and outcome data from patients with acute myocardial infarction were collected at the eight hospitals collaborating in the RICVAL, from 1 December 1993 to 30 November 1994. RESULTS The eight participating hospitals cover 1,665,720 people. During 12 months, 1,124 patients were discharged from the participating coronary care units. Mean age was 65.1 years and 23.9% were female. The case fatality rate was 16.9%. Left ventricular failure (Killip 2, 3 and 4) was present in 42%. Thrombolytic therapy was applied in 43.5% with a median time delay of 210 minutes from chest pain onset. The delay time in initiating thrombolysis was longer in the women and in the elderly. CONCLUSION Analysis of present data shows the feasibility of an acute myocardial infarction register in Valencia City. The RICVAL study will allow a better knowledge of demographic, clinical, procedural and outcome data in patients with myocardial infarction. The case fatality rate is still high when we consider that an acceptable level of thrombolytic therapy has been reached. The long delay time in initiating thrombolysis, particularly in the elderly and in the women, must be emphasized.</dc:description>
