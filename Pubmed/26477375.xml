<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Choledochal cysts are rare. They usually present during childhood in women, but it can also be seen during pregnancy. Clinical signs and symptoms are obscured during this time, thus it can complicate the diagnosis and represent a life threatening complication for both the mother and the child. OBJECTIVE To communicate the case of 3 pregnant patients with choledochal cyst. CLINICAL CASES Three pregnant women in which choledochal cyst were diagnosed. Two developed signs of cholangitis. The first one underwent a hepatic-jejunostomy, but had an abortion and died on postoperative day 10. The second one had a preterm caesarean operation due to foetal distress and underwent a hepatic-jejunostomy 4 weeks later; during her recovery she had a gastric perforation and died of septic complications. The third one did not develop cholangitis or jaundice. She had an uneventful pregnancy and had a hepatic-jejunostomy 4 weeks later with good results. CONCLUSIONS Management of choledochal cysts during pregnancy is related to the presence of cholangitis. When they do not respond to medical treatment, decompression of the biliary tree is indicated. Definitive treatment should be performed after resolution of the pregnancy.</dc:description>
