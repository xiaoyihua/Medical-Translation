<dc:description xml:lang="en">Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the most common parasitic disease of the central nervous system. Several drugs, such as drugs against tapeworms, praziquantel or albendazole associated to corticosteroids, have been tested for the treatment of this condition. Although some have claimed the reduction or involution of cystic or granulomatous lesions, there is no consensus about the efficacy of these treatments. The natural evolution of the disease is not clear and this hampers the assessment of treatment effects. Moreover, there are no good imaging or clinical indicators that can predict the progression or spontaneous resolution of lesions, specially at the meningeal or ventricular compartment. Therefore, evidence based medicine does not have a definitive answer about the treatment, neither of seizures, the most common manifestation of NCC, or the varied and complex meningeal and ventricular involvement. This review includes experts opinions to give the clinician some clues for decision making in the treatment of NCC.</dc:description>
