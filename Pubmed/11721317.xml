<dc:description xml:lang="en">Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding disorder characterized by accelerated splenic removal of platelets opsonized with autoantibodies. Several different treatments have been tried in acute ITP patients, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. The aim of this paper was to assess the therapeutic efficacy, clinical tolerance and viral safety of Inmunoglobulina G Endovenosa-UNC, manufactured by Laboratorio de Hemoderivados, Cordoba National University, in the treatment of acute ITP patients. A prospective longitudinal study was carried out on 8 children, who were admitted to the Hospital de Niños de Córdoba, from July 1998 to June 1999. A dose of 1 g/Kg/day of Inmunoglobulina G Endovenosa-UNC was administered to those children whose platelet values remained &lt; or = 20,000/mm3, 21 days after the first IVIG cycle. The observed results led us to conclude that Inmunoglobulina G Endovenosa-UNC is well tolerated and therapeutically effective in the treatment of acute ITP in children, with platelet values recovery, similar to those obtained with other IVIG. Moreover, it proved to be virally safe since the 8 patients were non reactive for viral markers of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency, 12 months after ending the treatment.</dc:description>
