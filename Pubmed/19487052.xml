<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the validity of the questionnaire Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) compared with clinical records. METHODS A descriptive, prospective, multicenter study was performed within the framework of the Peripheral Arterial Disease Study (PERART) in 3,329 persons aged &gt;50 years old. The sample was selected by simple random sampling in 32 primary health care centers. The diagnoses included were acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. Treatment variables were also considered (antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and hypoglycemic agents or insulin, as well as antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents). The sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and kappa index were computed to test the validity of the MONICA questionnaire. RESULTS The mean age was 65 years (SD 8.9) and 54.8% were women. The sensitivity of the questionnaire was &gt;90% for all the variables apart from angina pectoris (89.9%) and cerebrovascular disease (86.5%). Specificity was also &gt;90%, except for angina pectoris (88.3%) and hypercholesterolemia (77.5%). The positive predictive value was &gt;90% for all the treatments; &gt;80% for angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction and hypertension; 79.4% for cerebrovascular disease; 79.1% for hypercholesterolemia and 73.4% for diabetes mellitus. The negative predictive value was &gt;90% for all the variables. The kappa indexes were &gt;0.80 for all the variables apart from hypercholesterolemia (0.69) and diabetes mellitus (0.79). CONCLUSIONS The MONICA cardiovascular questionnaire is valid in the assessment of cardiovascular disease, risk factors and treatments in patients aged &gt;50 years old.</dc:description>
