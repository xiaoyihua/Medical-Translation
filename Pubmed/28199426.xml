<dc:description xml:lang="en">To address the symptoms of depersonalization and derealization a specific dissociative subtype of posttraumatic stress disorder has been included in DSM-5. Depersonalization and derealization have been defined as acute and chronic symptoms of dissociative disorders since DSM-III. Dissociative disorders with chronic features are often diagnosed in North America, Canada and other European countries, but this is not the case in Argentina. Dissociative disorders have clinical and historical features that are strongly connected with hysteria. The latter is included in ICD-10 within the guidelines for diagnoses of dissociative disorders. This would be one of the reasons for not using dissociative disorders with chronic presentations of symptoms like depersonalization and derealization in countries other than North America or Canada: instead hysteria keeps on been used. The relation between trauma, dissociation and hysteria has been explained in different ways depending on the underlying theory (i.e. Janet's or Freud's). Janet's conceptualizations have had decisive influence in DSM formulations in chronic forms of dissociative disorders. Janet's and Freud's theories lead to different consequences on psychotherapy: hypnosis or psychoanalysis. The aim of this article is to show that the authors of PTSD dissociative subtype are in search of a cross-cultural validity of the construct which might be able to exert a more global influence.</dc:description>
