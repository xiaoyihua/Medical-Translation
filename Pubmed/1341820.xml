<dc:description xml:lang="en">We analyzed the infectious complications associated with the use of permanent central venous catheters (PVC) in pediatric and adult cancer patients. 62 patients used 74 PVC (54 external, 20 subcutaneous), which were in place for an average of 200 days with a total observation period of 14,876 days, 152 febrile episodes occurred during this period, 87 in neutropenic patients (less than 500 neutrophils/mu, FN+) and 65 in non neutropenic patients (FN-). The incidence of bacteremia was 32% in febrile episodes in the first group (FN+C+ and 41% in the second (FN-C+). Overall there were 3.7 episodes of bacteremia per 1000 catheter days. We found a statistically significant difference in the incidence of bacteremia between the external and subcutaneous PVC in favor of the latter among patients over 15 years of age but not in the pediatric group. 14 PVC had to be removed due to an infection, 8 in patients with bacteremia and 6 in patients with exit site infections. We conclude that the use of PVC in the care of cancer patients is beneficial and safe, with a low incidence of infectious complications.</dc:description>
