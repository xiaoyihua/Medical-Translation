<dc:description xml:lang="en">We are pleased to present the European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention, translated and adapted by the Interdisciplinary Spanish Committee for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention. This guide is focused on the prevention of cardiovascular disease as a whole, recommending the SCORE model for risk assessment and placing priority on the care of patients and high-risk individuals. The objective is to prevent premature death due to CVD by means of dealing with its related risk factors in clinical practice. Hence, a maintained professional intervention is required in order to obtain an increase of physical activity and of healthy diets in patients high-risk individuals, and smoking cessation in smokers. The decision to start blood pressure treatment will depend upon the BP values, cardiovascular risk and possible damage to target organs. The treatment goal is to achieve BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg, but among patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, a past history of ictus, coronary heart disease or heart failure, lower levels must be pursued. Serum cholesterol must be below 200 mg/dl and LDL cholesterol below 130 mg/dl, although among patients with CVD or diabetes, levels respectively below 175 mg/dl and 100 mg/dl must be pursued. Advice of a professional dietitian is always required in order to keep blood sugar levels controlled. Proper insulin therapy is required in Type I diabetes. Patients with Type II diabetes and those with metabolic syndrome must lose weight and increase their physical activity.,dngus beiln aiministered wherever applicable. Lastly, an appendix is included providing diet recommendations adapted to our environment and criteria related to referral or seeing a specialist for hypertensive or dyslipemic patients.</dc:description>
