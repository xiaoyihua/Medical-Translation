<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Recent publications have concluded that there are social health inequalities in people older than 65 years in Spain, especially among women and people with low socioeconomic status. Self-perceived health is an indicator that is related to the possibility of chronic disease, the use of health services, and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess inequalities in self-perceived health in relation to age, gender, socioeconomic factors, and functional dependence. METHODS A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA criteria. An exhaustive search was performed in PubMed, WOK, Science Direct, EMBASE, IME, Cochrane, JSTOR, Ovid, Proquest, the BMJ Group and in Spanish doctoral theses up to April 2013. The quality of the studies was assessed by two independent editors through the Berra Tool. RESULTS A total of 20 documents were selected. These studies were in agreement in the deterioration of self-perceived health among older people (except the oldest), in those with functional dependence, lower socioeconomic status, and in women. CONCLUSIONS This review shows that, among older people, inequalities in self-perceived health due to socioeconomic status and gender have persisted in time. Future research is needed to cast light on the factors determining the persistence of these inequalities among older people, so that specific health policies can be designed for this sector of the population.</dc:description>
