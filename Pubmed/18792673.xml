<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Colonic duplication is an uncommon congenital anomaly. Bowel obstruction, presence of an abdominal mass, and sometimes bleeding and perforation may be the clinical manifestations. OBJECTIVE To report a patient with colonic duplication who underwent to surgical treatment due to acute abdominal pain. REPORT OF THE CASE 17 year-old, female patient admitted to the emergency room due to acute abdominal pain and signs of intestinal obstruction, at her initial evaluation she was tachycardic, hyperthermic with 38 degrees C, dehydration, abdominal distention, acute abdominal pain, absent peristalsis and peritoneal signs. Laboratories with Hb 14.2 g/dL, leucocytosis of 16,000 mm3, plain abdominal films showed dilation of intestinal loops and air-fluid levels. A laparotomy for intestinal obstruction was performed; operative findings were a tubular colonic duplication that demands a complete resection of the duplicated segment. CONCLUSION Colonic duplication is a rare congenital anomaly, the onset of the symptoms can occur during infancy or early childhood. It must be consider as differential diagnoses in patients with intestinal obstruction and palpable abdominal mass in this rank of ages.</dc:description>
