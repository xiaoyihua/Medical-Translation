<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Acute mastoiditis is the most common complication of acute otitis media. Recent studies have noticed an increase in cases. The goal of this study was to review acute mastoiditis cases diagnosed in children younger than 14 years old. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study of all patients under 14 years old admitted with a diagnosis of mastoiditis between 1996 and 2008 was performed. Epidemiological, laboratory and clinical variables were analysed. RESULTS Sixty-one charts were reviewed. The mean age was 28 months; 55.7% of the patients were male. Most cases were in the autumn and winter; 79% occurred from 2002 to 2008. Most cases (82%) had antecedents of an upper airway catarrhal process and 60.7% had a clinical diagnosis of acute otitis media. Prior antibacterial agent therapy had been administered in 55.7% of the cases. Culture of middle ear effusions was performed in 48 patients, revealing Streptococcus pneumonia in 39.7%, Haemophilus influenzae in 2%, Staphylococcus aureus in 12.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 8.3%. Cultures were sterile in 18 patients (37.5%). Of the pneumococcal isolates, 26.2% were resistant to penicillin or third generation cephalosporins. Most cases (93.4%) responded well to antibacterial therapy alone or with myringotomy. There were complications in 7 patients (11.5%). Mastoid surgery was performed in 4 patients. CONCLUSIONS Acute mastoiditis shows a rising incidence in recent years. The most commonly isolated form is the pneumococcus, the high rates of antibiotic resistance in our study being notable. Treatments with antibiotics alone or in combination with myringotomy are effective in less severe forms.</dc:description>
