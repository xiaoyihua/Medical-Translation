<dc:description xml:lang="en">Acetylcholinesterase (AChe) hydrolyses acetylcholine to choline and acetate, thereby inactivating the neurotransmitter. However, the possible non-cholinergic function of this enzyme has been recently suggested. In the present work, changes in AChe activity during the postnatal development of the cat brain are described, in order to show if the enzyme could play a part in the maturing processes of the CNS. The study was performed in the frontal and parietal cortices, area 17 and areas 18 and 19 as a whole in the 15 and 30 days postnatal stages. Significant increases with age were observed in all the brain areas under study. It is suggested that this enzyme activity play a part in the maturation of the cat brain cortices, possibly in the cholinergic development and/or as a cell growth regulatory factor.</dc:description>
