<dc:description xml:lang="en">During the XXth century, neuropsychiatrists Isaac and José Horwitz worked in the Asylum, the current Psychiatric Institute Dr José Horwitz. While Isaac dedicated part of his time to teach in Medical and Nursing Schools, his brother José preferred clinical work on mental health. Both chaired consecutively the Service A of the old Hospital and José occupied in his last year the Director's position. After a scholarship in Mental Health in Baltimore, José developed, in conjunction with other outstanding colleagues, the first investigations on psychiatric morbidity in Chile, promoted the use of work therapy for individuals with chronic mental diseases, and helped to improve and plan projects for the prevention and treatment of alcoholism.</dc:description>
