<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Pemphigus comprises a group of autoimmune blistering diseases that affect the skin and mucous membranes. Its clinical and epidemiologic features vary according to geographic location and ethnic background. OBJECTIVE An exhaustive search of the literature reveals very few reports of the epidemiology of pemphigus in setting. Our aim, thus, was to conduct a retrospective study of the clinical and epidemiologic features of pemphigus at a secondary care hospital in Málaga, Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied 20 patients diagnosed with pemphigus in our department over a period of 13 years (January 1995 to January 2008). RESULTS We analyzed a large variety of clinical and epidemiologic parameters including sex; age; type of pemphigus; time since onset; associated symptoms; type, morphology, and location of lesions at the time of diagnosis; extent of skin and mucosal involvement; treatment received; treatment-related adverse effects and complications; number of hospital admissions; and patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS Except for minor differences, our results are in agreement with published data on pemphigus regarding sex, age, and clinical presentation. According to our results, male sex is a predictor of poor prognosis as it is associated with poorer response to treatment and a higher rate of adverse effects and hospital admission.</dc:description>
