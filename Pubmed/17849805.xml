<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The role of the series of metabolic derangements associated to diabetes mellitus type 2 on the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis and on semen quality is still controversial due in part to the lack of information about the selection criteria of subjects included in previously published studies. This is important due to the high prevalence of occult pathology of the seminal tract. OBJECTIVE To determine if diabetes mellitus type 2 is related to hormonal or seminal disorders. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this retrospective study serum concentration of the hormones that regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis and semen quality were analyzed comparatively in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and normoglycemic subjects. In both groups occult seminal disorders and conditions associated to the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis dysfunction were discarded. RESULTS Serum concentration of FSH was higher in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 than in controls (6.06 +/- 2.28 vs. 4.74 +/- 1.92, p = 0.04). Serum concentration of prolactin was lower in diabetics than in controls (6.71 +/- 1.28 vs. 8 +/- 1.97, p = 0.002). The only seminal abnormality found in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 was a lower progressive mobility (46.52 +/- 17.77 vs. 58.88 +/- 16.81, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION This suggests that the patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 have subclinical tubular dysfunction manifested by a low sperm progressive mobility and that this might be associated to subfertility.</dc:description>
