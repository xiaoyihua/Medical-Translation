<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To present the post-surgery clinical results of deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus (GPi) in a group of paediatric patients with primary and secondary dystonic-dyskinetic syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between November 1996 and May 2006, 121 patients were submitted to interventions with bilateral deep brain stimulation of the GPi, 58 of whom were children (age range: 5-16 years); 35 were cases of primary dystonia, of which 17 were carriers of the DYT1 mutation and 10 were not. A further 8 cases were myoclonic dystonias, 3 of whom presented the DYT11 mutation. With regard to the secondary dystonias, 4 were carriers of PKAN (pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration) syndrome and 9 were cases of post-anoxic encephalopathies. RESULTS Percentage improvements were as follows: in the case of DYT1+ primary dystonias, 80% at one year maintained at 3 years; in cases of DYT1-, 70% at one year maintained at 3 years, and in the myoclonic dystonias, 50% at one year and 85% at 3 years. In the group of patients with secondary dystonias due to post-anoxic encephalopathies, we found an improvement of 30% at one year and 40% at 3 years; in the group with PKAN syndrome, the figures were 60% at one year and 50% at two years. CONCLUSIONS Treatment involving bilateral deep brain stimulation of the GPi nuclei in childhood cases of generalised dystonias is highly effective, the best prognoses being those offered by the group with primary dystonias and especially those related to the DYT1 mutation. Treatment also proved to be effective in the case of secondary dystonias, although with lower degrees of improvement.</dc:description>
