<dc:description xml:lang="en">The prevalence of congestive heart failure has increased in the world. Despite advances in pharmacological treatment, some patients have progression of the disease and deterioration of their functional class. In this group of patients cardiac resynchronization therapy has been accepted as a treatment option. However, some patients are non-responders to cardiac resynchronization, and others who respond favorably, will experience reappearance of their symptoms. For these patients, multisite stimulation with the implant of a second electrode in the right ventricle has been published as a new option. We report a 76 year-old woman with a dilated cardiomyopathy, who was treated with resynchronization therapy with good clinical response during two years, but symptoms of congestive heart failure reappeared and her functional class deteriorated to NYHA class IV. She was successfully treated with right ventricular multisite stimulation, with a reduction of symptoms that has lasted during the two months of follow up after the procedure.</dc:description>
