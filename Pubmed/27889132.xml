<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION There is evidence of increased macro- and micro-vascular risk in diabetic patients. The objective of this study was to determine the level of control in patients in different population groups with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN Descriptive cross-sectional study. LOCATION Primary care. Madrid Health Service. Year: 2014. SUBJECTS Patients over 14 years with type 2 diabetes. Number of patientes: n=6674. MEASUREMENTS Variables on the degree of control (HbA1c, systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], LDL-c) and variables on patient characteristics (demographic, other cardiovascular risk factors, complications). RESULTS The mean age of patients with controlled HbA1c was 67.8 years vs. 62.9 years in the uncontrolled (P&lt;.001). Patients diagnosed with hypertension have a higher percentage of control with respect to the undiagnosed in HbA1c, SBP, DBP and LDL-c: 51 vs. 37%, 62 vs. 43%, 75 vs. 47% and 57 vs. 44% respectively; diagnosed with dyslipidaemia: 51 vs. 39%, 60 vs. 49%, 70 vs. 56% and 56 vs. 46%. With a diagnosis of macroangiopathy: 46 vs. 45%, 58 vs. 54%, 71 vs. 62% and 15 vs. 60%. All differences were statistically significant (P&lt;.001). Over 50% of patients without a diagnosis of hypertension had an SBP&gt; 140mmHg or DBP&gt; 90mmHg. Over 25% of patients with hypertension or DL and uncontrolled levels were not receiving drug treatment. CONCLUSION Control was improved in all groups, especially in younger patients, with particularly high cardiovascular risk by the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors or macroangiopathy. A significant percentage of patients with uncontrolled BP and cLDL were not diagnosed or receiving drug treatment.</dc:description>
