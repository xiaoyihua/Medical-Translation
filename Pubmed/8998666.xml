<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to know if endoscopic sphincterectomy could be an alternative to cholecystectomy in high surgical risk patients that have suffered acute biliary pancreatitis. Between January 1992 to December 1995 endoscopic sphincterectomy was carried out in 52 high surgical risk patients who had suffered an episode of acute biliary pancreatitis. The lithiasic gallbladder was not removed. The mean age was 75.6 years (35-91). After a follow up of 15.9 months (1-46.5), no patient suffered from a new episode of acute pancreatitis. Six patients (12%) required cholecystectomy due to complications derived from the lithiasic gallbladder. Endoscopic sphincterectomy is an effective alternative to cholecystectomy in the prevention of new episodes of acute biliary pancreatitis in patients with lithiasic gallbladder and high surgical risk. The complications of the lithiasic gallbladder in situ after endoscopic sphincterectomy are relatively infrequent.</dc:description>
