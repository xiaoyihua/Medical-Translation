<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The complications of the mixed hernia need, often, surgical treatment. In the asymtomatic patients this one treatment is controversial, due to her complex repair and the high percentage of relapse informed in the long term. The surgical classic routes, they present raised morbi-mortality related to the extent of the incisions, to long hospitable stays and slow recovery. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between October, 2001 to November, 2007 we check 39 patients with hernia hiatal mixed with a middle ages of 65 years (35-78 years). In Lloyd-Davies s position, the content diminishes hernia and the redundant sack is resected. The diaphragmatic props are sutured by material not reabsorbable. Mesh of reinforcement intervened in 7/39 repairs. It concludes with a partial or complete antirreflux depending on the report. RESULTS The operative average time was of 126 min; the hospital stay of 2.46 days. The complications perioperatives are principally cardiorespiratory. A patient died for an intestinal inadvertent perforation during the intervention and of late diagnosis. We realize traffic gastroduodenal to 12 months in 28 patients (71.7%). We find relapse in 8 patients (20.5%). Four asymtomatic patients, with chance find in the radiological control. Three patients with pirosis that needs treatment and one of the relapses needed reintervention for strangulation of a gastric volvulus. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic surgery offers safety and efficiency with rapid postoperatory recovery, minor morbidity and hospitable stay. After the surgery, the long-term relapse presents similar results to the opened surgery, though the interposition of mesh can propitiate her decrease.</dc:description>
