<dc:description xml:lang="en">Canine brucellosis, caused by Brucella canis, provokes epidydimitis, testicular atrophy and sterility in male dogs, while in females the major symptom is miscarriage. Transmission to humans may be through contact with semen, urine and/or aborted fetuses of infected animals. Our study, observational and cross-sectional, focused on dogs in lower class neighborhoods and slums with a high rate of unmet basic needs (UBN) in 8 areas of the city of Buenos Aires. We studied 219 dogs: 184 females and 35 males, that tested negative to the buffered plate antigen test (BPAT), which ruled out infection with smooth species of Brucella. We detected anti-B. canis antibodies in 16 dogs (7.3%): 9 females and 7 males, relevant data since the urine of males is considered one of the vectors for the spread of the infection. Although we could run blood cultures on only 175 animals, we isolated B. canis in 3 (2 females and 1 male). Only 3 of the owners of dogs that tested positive consented to a serological diagnosis and two of them were positive. We highlight that the agar gel immunodiffusion test (IGID) proved to have low sensitivity, having detected only one of the 16 positive cases and none of the three confirmed by isolation. We conclude that in the areas studied, the detection of serologically positive dogs and the isolation of B. canis in 3 cases are indicators of the health hazard for the population exposed to it.</dc:description>
