<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The present study aimed to evaluate the profile of patients with decompensated heart failure hospitalized in a tertiary hospital. METHODS It was designed an observational and retrospective study where data from clinical records of patients suffering from heart failure along 2005 were registered randomly. RESULTS 209 patients were collected (average age: 78.6 +/- 9.1; male: 52.4%) with a comorbidity rate of 87.55%. Almost one third of them have not stimation of systolic function and among the others 72.4% have it preserved. Most of decompensated were due to respiratory infections. Ischemic-hipertensive cardiopathy was the most frequent aetiology of systolic disfunction. Average stay was 12.9 days with a mortality rate of 9.56%. Its main risk factors were advanced stages in NYHA od Red Cross scales, as so as dementia or ictus. CONCLUSIONS The present study shows a patient hospitalized for decompensated heart failure roughly different from that one reported at clinical trials. It makes difficult to apply therapeutical interventions, previously well documented to be useful.</dc:description>
