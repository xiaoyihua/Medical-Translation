<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To compare two active educational strategies on critical reading (two and three stages) for research learning in medical students. MATERIAL AND METHODS Four groups were conformed in a quasi-experimental design. The medical student group, related to three stages (critical reading guide resolution, creative discussion, group discussion) g1, n = 9 with school marks &gt; 90 and g2, n = 19 with a &lt; 90, respectively. The two-stage groups (guide resolution and group discussion) were conformed by pre-graduate interns, g3, n = 17 and g4, n = 12, who attended social security general hospitals. A validated and consistent survey with 144 items was applied to the four groups before and after educational strategies. Critical reading with its subcomponents: interpretation, judgment and proposal were evaluated with 47, 49 and 48 items, respectively. The case control studies, cohort studies, diagnostic test and clinical trial designs were evaluated. Nonparametric significance tests were performed to compare the groups and their results. A bias calculation was performed for each group. RESULTS The highest median was obtained by the three-stage groups (g1 and g2) and so were the medians in interpretation, judgment and proposal. The several research design results were higher in the same groups. CONCLUSIONS An active educational strategy with three stages is superior to another with two stages in medical students. It is advisable to perform these activities in goal of better learning in our students.</dc:description>
