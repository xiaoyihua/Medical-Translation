<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Supraorbital neuralgia has only recently been described. Most of the cases reported involve patients suffering from chronic idiopathic neuralgias that are difficult to treat and sometimes require surgery to release the nerve. We present our experience in patients with a variant of this neuralgia which has a known causation, is commonly seen and has a benign prognosis. CASE REPORTS We studied five patients, four females and one male, with a mean age of 55 years (range: 29-69 years). They had all suffered direct banal traumatic injury to the frontal region due to different causes. Four of them developed continuous, piercing or burning-type pain; three of them had paroxysmal pain and one had itching. There were no autonomic manifestations. All of them were found to be abnormally sensitive in the affected area, with tactile hypaesthesia, hyperalgesia or allodynia and a positive Tinel's sign. Neuroimaging tests were normal. Two patients were treated with gabapentin and amitriptyline. One was treated with an anaesthetic blockade, which afforded temporary relief. Three of them received no treatment at all. After one year of follow-up, all of them had improved and three were no longer in pain, although sensory alterations persisted in all cases. CONCLUSIONS Post-traumatic supraorbital neuralgia is a frequent condition, although it is probably underdiagnosed. It has its own characteristic clinical and developmental features that distinguish it from idiopathic supraorbital neuralgia. Progress is usually good and it responds favourably to symptomatic treatment, if needed.</dc:description>
