<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM The aim of this study is to analyse the quality of life in patients with ileoanal pouch respect to a diverting loop ileostomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifteen patients (8 women and 7 men) with mean average age of 33 years who underwent mucosal proctectomy, colectomy, ileal-pouch-anal anastomosis and temporary loop ileostomy. Quality of life was studied when the patients had an ileostomy and follow-up evaluation, one year after restitution of anal defecation. The surgeons' evaluation was done using a health scale. RESULTS Among the patients with temporary ileostomy, 40% reported bad tolerance, 53% leakage of stoma bag and 26% skin problems. The mean stool frequency among ileoanal anastomosis was four per day, 87% reported total continence, 13% had major complications and they needed pouch removal. 67% patients with ileostomy reported dietary restrictions against 13% patients functioning with pelvic pouch (p = 0.004). 13% patients with ileostomy had restricted sport activities. Social activities were restricted for 40% and 26% had limitations in their ability to work. Sex life was affected in 20% of patients with ileostomy and 13% of patients with ileal pouch anastomosis. 73% of patients presented an excellent level of satisfaction with pouch. CONCLUSION Quality of life after ileoanal pouch anastomosis is higher than ileostomy.</dc:description>
