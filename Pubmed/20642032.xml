<dc:description xml:lang="en">Although some years ago the Moroccan immigrant population was mostly male, the number of women is increasing every day. This research is focused on this group, and has the following objectives: to know how emigration affects the fulfillment of Virginia Henderson's basic needs; what transformations and adaptations must be adopted in order to fulfill them; and what reinterpretations and strategies are implemented in order to minimize the impact of culture shock. A qualitative study was performed from 2004-2005 by means of semi-structured interviews to 20 Muslim immigrant women in a municipality of Galicia (Spain), and showed that for Muslim people, everything is regulated by religion, so the necessities affected are strongly related with the need of acting according to one's values and beliefs. Therefore, valuing the referred need provides fundamental data in order to direct the activities towards keeping and recovering health.</dc:description>
