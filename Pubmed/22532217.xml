<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Few studies have been conducted on the incidence of migraine in Spain, and those that have been carried out have some shortcomings, such as the lack of a clear population base. AIMS To examine the evolution of the incidence of migraine over the period 2004-2008 in the province of Álava (Basque Country, Spain). PATIENTS AND METHODS Data concerned persons aged 15 or over who were registered in the Basque Health Service/Osakidetza database as new cases diagnosed with migraine. The tendency of the incidence of migraine was evaluated by means of linear regression. RESULTS The incidence of migraine was significantly higher in females than in males, at any age. No significant changes in the incidence of migraine were observed over the period 2004-2008 in the population of Ávala as a whole (p = 0.189). Nevertheless, there have been both a decrease in the incidence of migraine in females over the age of 64 (p = 0.014) and an increase in those aged 15-24 years (p = 0.052) and 35-44 years (p = 0.057). The new cases of migraine that are diagnosed tended to appear at younger ages over this period. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest an absence of changes in the tendency in the incidence of migraine throughout the period 2004-2008, except for a decrease in the case of females over 64 years of age and an increase in young females. This evolution is similar to that of other regions in Europe.</dc:description>
