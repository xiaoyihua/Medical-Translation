<dc:description xml:lang="en">Eight patients (7 female, 1 male) diagnosed as being allergic to insulin, between the ages of 49 and 68, were evaluated. In seven patients there was a previous history of allergies to other drugs: 4 to penicillin, two to sulfurs and one to nalidixic acid. The clinical manifestations were predominantly systemic: ras, six patients; angioedema, 3 patients; hypotension, three patients; bronchial spasm, 2 patients; generalized eruption, one patient. All 8 patients were subjected to skin tests which were positive, one patient showed a positive local skin reaction and the other seven proved to be positive. All reactions were favorable in all cases which allowed for the continuation of the administration of insulin without adverse reactions.</dc:description>
