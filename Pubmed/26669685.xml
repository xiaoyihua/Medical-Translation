<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In few previous works, it has been reported that hypercalciuria is associated with some types of CAKUT, namely ureteropelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux or simple renal cysts. In addition, one higher prevalence of hypercalciuria and/or urolithiasis has been described in their family members compared to the general population. This study was carried out to find out whether children with unilateral renal agenesis (URA) have these features previously described in other CAKUT types. METHODS In a descriptive and multicenter study we studied the prevalence of hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia and urolithiasis in 67 children (43 males and 24 females) with URA and their families. RESULTS The two metabolic anomalies that promote stone formation were observed in 26 children (38.8%), distributed as follows: hypercalciuria in 16, hypocitraturia in 9, and both hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia in 1. Eight children (11.9%) suffered renal colic during follow-up. Familial history of urolithiasis was found in 42/67 children (62.7%): in 12 of the first-degree relatives, in 15 of the second degree relatives and in 15 patients both in the first-degree as in their second degree relatives. In contrast, in historic control group, only in 28.1% of families at least one member had urolithiasis. CONCLUSION Our results show that the prevalence of hypercalciuria and/or hypocitraturia is greater in pediatric patients with URA than in the general population. Likewise, the prevalence of urolithiasis in the families of these children is also higher than that in the general population.</dc:description>
