<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Congenital venous malformations are the most common slow-flow vascular abnormalities during childhood. Although they are usually present at birth, clinical evidence often appear during late childhood. This type of malformations do not disappear, and they grow progressively during years. PATIENTS AND METHODS We present a retrospective study based on the medical records of 72 patients treated in our Department during the last 15 years. Patients' age at the diagnosis was 5 days to 26 years. Male-female relationship was 2:1. The most frequent locations were Upper and lower extremities, followed by head and neck. We do not include in this study those patients with mixed lesions involving CNS or abdomen. RESULTS Main symptoms were: pain, 60%; thrombophlebitis, growing size of the extremities, dermis lesions, osseous dystrophy and chronic coagulopathy. Symptoms worsening was related to trauma, infections and hormonal changes. Clinical course was the clue for the diagnosis. Eco-doppler was useful to study the flow of the lesion. MRI was employed to determinate the limits of the lesion. We did not perform arteriography, and phlebography was used as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Plain X-rays showed phleboliths in most of patients and osseous changes in a group of six patients. Treatment was conservative and palliative using elastic stockings, pain therapy and thromboembolism prophylaxis. This was the only treatment in irresectable lesions and in those cases without functional abnormalities. Surgery and sclerotherapy were the main curative treatments. Sclerotherapy was employed in cases of intramuscular and in delimited lesions. Ethanol and Ethibloc (Sodic Amidotrozoate) were the sclerosant agents. We performed surgery in cases of cutaneous complications, localized muscular lesions and in cases of recurrences after sclerotherapy. Ablative surgery was followed by reconstructive attempts using cutaneous and dermal artificial grafts. CONCLUSIONS Congenital venous malformations must be diagnosed and treated during childhood. Conservative and resective treatments are useful in different cases. Accurate diagnosis and treatment improve long term results.</dc:description>
