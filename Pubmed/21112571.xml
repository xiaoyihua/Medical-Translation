<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Chronic inflammation of nasolacrimal duct determines obstruction of the lacrimal flow and is called chronic dacryocystitis. Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) can solve this obstruction by opening the lacrimal sac directly to the nasal cavity, avoiding external scars in a simple, safe way. MATERIAL AND METHOD We reviewed all cases operated using this technique between January 1996 and June 2008. We focused on demographic characteristics as well as the results obtained (subjective and objective improvements). RESULTS We reviewed 76 Endoscopic DCR that were performed during aforementioned period of time. Of these cases, 75% were females; mean age was 52.4 years old. Improvement in symptoms was reported by 80.3% of the patients. These data are similar to the results seen in other studies. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy is a simple, safe technique for treating chronic dacryocystitis, which provides similar or even better rates of improvement than other techniques used for this condition. In our patients, the results are not different from those observed in other studies. Our outcomes are comparable to those observed in other studies.</dc:description>
