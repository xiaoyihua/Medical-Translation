<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The aim is to determine the effect of the treatment with venlafaxine extended release in patients with alcohol or cocaine dependence disorder that initiate detoxification treatment. METHODS Observational, open, prospective study carried out in Spain in 2005. 55 patients older than 18 years of age with diagnosis of alcohol and/or cocaine dependence disorder, hospitalized in Specialty Care Center to initiate detoxification treatment, were included. Daily doses of 75 to 225 mg of venlafaxine extended release were administered for 6 months. RESULTS Treatment was associated with significant reductions in EuropASI scores in the following areas: 3, alcohol use, baseline and final score of 8.2 +/- 0.2 and 6.4 +/- 0.4, respectively (P &lt; 0.01); 5, family/social relations, initial score of 6.9 +/- 0.2 and of 5.2 +/- 0.5 at endpoint (P &lt; 0.001); 1, medical status, scores of 3.7 +/- 0.4 and 0.9 +/- 0.3 (baseline and final visits, respectively) (P &lt; 0.001); and 6, psychiatric status, with a baseline score of 7.8 +/- 0.1 and final score of 5.4 +/- 0.4 (P &lt; 0.001). The VAS alcohol craving scores at baseline were 26.7 +/- 4.6, decreasing to 4.1 +/- 1.5 at endpoint (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The results of this observational study suggest that venlafaxine extended release could be effective as a coadyuvant in the treatment of alcohol dependent patients in alcohol detoxification therapy. Nevertheless, this should be confirmed with bigger placebo-controlled samples.</dc:description>
