<dc:description xml:lang="en">Topical nitrogen mustard (NH2) is recommended in mycosis fungoides stages 1 or 2 (eczematous premycotic phase and plaque stage), intratumor infiltration in stage 3 (tumor stage) and intravenous administration in stages 4 and 5 (widespread disease). Following these criteria ten patients with mycosis fungoides have been treated with NH2. Six cases were included in stages 1 or 2 and complete remission was achieved in four of them. Therapy had to discontinued in one case due to allergic hypersensitivity. The remaining patient experienced clinical improvement after 27 months of continued treatment. There were three patients in stages 4 and 5 and all their plaques disappeared after topical NH2, but tumor regression was completely achieved in one case adn partially in the remaining two. A case with Sezary's syndrome was treated in addition with chlorambucil. Association of newer palliative measures (topical NH2, high energy electron beam therapy, nitrosourea derivatives) offer a hope of cure for patients in stages 1 or 2. Tumor stage requires systemic chemotherapeutic agents (chlorambucil tablets and intravenous nitrogen mustard).</dc:description>
