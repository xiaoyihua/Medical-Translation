<dc:description xml:lang="en">México's National Health Information and Documentation Center (CENIDS), planned and designed a Selective Dissemination of Information Program in support of Priority Health Problems (DSI-APS). After one year of the implementation phase of this Program, an evaluation survey was conducted in order to measure its impact. Two questionnaires were sent to the institutional managers (C-I) and to the end-users (C-II). A total of 54 questionnaires (CI and CII) were sent via air mail to both the Health and the Education Sectors. Fifty (92.59%) responses were obtained from CI and 242 from CII. (CII could be reproduced as many times as needed). The results indicated the topics of more demand by the institutions and by the users. Eighty one per cent of the end-users scored over eight (scale 1-10) their degree of satisfaction when using the topics. Seventy two per cent of the institutions reported being unable to pay for this service; however, 93% of the end-users state that the Program should continue. It was detected that the topics represent an important support to "research" and "delivery of health care" activities. Finally, it was recommended to carry out specific studies so as to reformulate search strategies; satisfy selective needs, considering the impact obtained; and optimize existent resources.</dc:description>
