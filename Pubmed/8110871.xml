<dc:description xml:lang="en">A study was made of the possible influence of sepsis on liver protein synthesis in septic and control rats, fed either parenterally (TPN) or with water and feed available "ad libitum". Liver protein synthesis was determined using the single massive dose method. In experiment I, the septic and control animals received TPN for twenty-four hours: in experiment II water and food was available to them "ad libitum". Twenty-four hours after the sepsis occurred, the animals were injected with a massive dose of 14C-labelled leucine, and slaughtered by decapitation. The septic animals with water and feed available "ad libitum" were fasted voluntarily without any intake. This group of fasted septic animals was the only one which lost weight. Liver protein synthesis increased in septic animals in comparison with the control animals, whether receiving TPN (112.2 +/- 8/78.5 +/- 13) or with "ad libitum" nutrition (97.2 +/- 15/60.8 +/- 8). The increased liver protein synthesis in the septic animals was modified (although with reduced significance) by parenteral nutrition (112.2 +/- 8/97.2 +/- 15). Our results suggest that sepsis increases liver protein synthesis, and that this protein synthesis may be enhanced by parenteral nutrition.</dc:description>
