<dc:description xml:lang="en">The spread and risk factors for HIV infection were studied in 288 men and 95 women at the prisons of Carabanchel and Yeserias, Madrid. These men and women requested care at the AIDS prevention program in the jails of Madrid, from April to December 1987. Among the men studied at Carabanchel, 55% were positive to HIV (77% seropositivity among intravenous drug users, IVDU). Tattooing (OR = 2.8), and number of times in prison (OR = 4.5 comparing those who had been 8 or more times in prison with those who had been in prison only once) were independent risk factors for infection, after controlling for IVDU. No association was found between seropositive status to HIV and reported anal intercourse. Among the women studied at Yeserias, the proportion of HIV seropositive women was 26% (70% of the IVDUs were seropositive). Tattooing, number of times in prison, history of prostitution and history of syphilis were associated with HIV infection. When controlling for IVDU, number of times in prison and history of prostitution were not independent risk factors for infection. These data indicate that there is a need for control measures to avoid further spread of the HIV infection among the inmate population, in particular through the use of contaminated needles while in prison.</dc:description>
