<dc:description xml:lang="en">Acute renal failure is one of the systemic complications that can be found in bothropic accidents. In this study the effects on male Wistar rats induced by the venom of Bothrops neuwiedii diporus were evaluated. The histopathology revealed acute tubular necrosis, lesions firstly were observed 3 hours post inoculation of 700 microg of venom. Cortical kidney congestion and granulohialin degeneration of tubular epithelial cells were observed, these lesions achieved a maximum at 24 hours after inoculation. Tubular epithelial hidropic degeneration and dilatation of tubular lumen with hyalin casts were present inclusive up to 4 weeks after inoculation. Biochemical parameter values associated with kidney renal failure were increased 6 hours after venom inoculation (urea: 1.10+/-0.22 g/dl; creatinine: 19.60+/-1.51 mg/dl), but at the end of the first week they decreased till normal values. The urinary density was lower than normal value: 1.005+/-0.001 (p&lt;0.001) and at the end of the first month they oscillated between 1.005 and 1.060 (p&lt;0.001). Renal injury induced by B. neuwiedii diporus could be better appreciated by histopathology than by the routine laboratory assays.</dc:description>
