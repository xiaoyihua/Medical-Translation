<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES the aim of this study was to determine the approaches used to treat acne in clinical practice by Spanish dermatologists. A secondary objective of the study was to compare the practices of Spanish dermatologists with the Acne Global Alliance treatment algorithm and develop a Spanish treatment algorithm for acne. PATIENTS AND METHODS a multicenter, cross-sectional survey was undertaken among 872 Spanish dermatologists. The study comprised 4 randomly distributed questionnaires. The first 3 contained the following case descriptions: severe acne associated with masculinization (case 1), mild comedonal acne (case 2), and moderate papulopustular acne (case 3). The fourth questionnaire contained 5 photographs of different types of acne and an algorithm containing various treatment options, from which dermatologists were asked to choose the most appropriate. RESULTS for case 1, 55% of dermatologists chose oral antiandrogens/contraceptive drugs plus topical retinoids or topical benzoyl peroxide/antibiotics. In case 2, 62% chose topical retinoids and, in case 3, 68% chose systemic antibiotics plus benzoyl peroxide. Combination therapy was considered the treatment of choice in all types of acne, with topical retinoids as the initial treatment option for mild and moderate forms and the preferred option for maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS in general, Spanish dermatologists treat acne in accordance with the Acne Global Alliance treatment algorithm. The varying opinions reported in response to open questions, however, confirm the need to unify criteria for the treatment of acne.</dc:description>
