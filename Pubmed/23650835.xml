<dc:description xml:lang="en">Inflammatory pseudo-tumor of the liver is a rare benign condition. Usually presented as a large liver mass, may cause obstruction or infiltration of the main vessels or biliary tree. The clinical presentation is mostly an inflammatory syndrome with acute abdominal pain. We present a 39-year-old female patient with abdominal pain, fever and jaundice. Images showed a 15-cm liver lesion in the left lobe of the liver. Malignancy could not be discarded and the patient underwent left hepatectomy. The histologic examination reported an inflammatory pseudo-tumor of the liver. The patient recurred after one year with the same symptoms and a 10-cm new lesion occupying segment I. Considered as a recurrence, medical treatment was decided tumor size decreased 50% after the first month and completely disappeared during the follow up. Two years later, the patient was readmitted with a new episode and a new 8-cm liver lesion in segment VII. She was treated again with anti-inflammatory medication and imaging control. Although inflammatory pseudo-tumor of the liver is a benign condition, it can have a recurrent behaviour. The differentiation with other malignant tumors sometimes is impossible by clinical and imaging presentation.</dc:description>
