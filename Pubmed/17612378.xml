<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Overweight and obesity represent an important public health problem in the world, including developed and underdeveloped countries, as contributing factors for non transmissible chronic illnesses in the adult, affecting both sexes, but especially to women. OBJECTIVE To associate excess in weight to the presence of comorbidities in adult women. METHODOLOGY 130 women, age 25 to 70 years with body mass index (BMI) &gt; 25 kg/m(2) were assessed. Weight, height, arm, waist and hip circumferences, tricipital and subescapular skinfolds. BMI, waist/hip ratio (W/H ratio) and fatty area were determined. Presence of diabetes mellitus (DM); high blood pressure (HBP), dyslipidemia and arthropathy were assessed. Overweight and obesity were classified according to OMS criteria. Data was analyzed by SPSS version 11.0. RESULTS 24,6% of women (n = 32) were overweight; 38,5% (n = 50) were obese I; 23,8% (n = 31) were obese II; and 13,1% (n = 17) had obesity III. Associated pathologies were present in 80,8% of the studied women: 46,9% (n = 61) with dyslipidemia; 42,3% (n = 55) with HBP; 33,1% (n = 43) with arthropaties; and 16,2% (n = 21) with DM. Overweight and obese I women showed a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia (56%) and (52%), respectively; while in Obese II and Obese III, 38,7% and 47,1% presented HBP respectively. There was a positive correlation (Spearman) among DM, HBP and dyslipidemia (p &lt; 0,05) with age; and significant correlation (Pearson, p &lt; 0,05) between W/H ratio and DM. CONCLUSION There was a high prevalence of associated pathologies in the valued women, being the most frequent dyslipidemia, HBP and arthropathy, which are directly proportional with the age and the IC/C.</dc:description>
