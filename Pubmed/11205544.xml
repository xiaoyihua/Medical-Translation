<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The infantile electroencephalogram has been studied in connection with many cognitive disabilities. Although normal resting infantile bioelectric recordings are known, the cortical distribution of electroencephalographic frequencies during other sensory and/or cognitive mental processes is less well known. OBJECTIVE Our interest is based on the description of EEGs of a homogeneous sample of healthy children and their relation to intellectual activities. MATERIAL AND METHODS The sample studied was made up of 13 healthy children with an average age of 9.3 +/- 1.3 years, on whom two types of tests of attention were done. One of the tasks was a simple auditory memory test and consisted of the spoken repetition of a series of numbers previously heard, which was of variable length. The second test consisted of the identification and crossing out of one face of a series of three faces, which included one which was different from the others. The methodology chosen was electroencephalographic measurement in the frequency and temporal domains. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS There was a relative increase in beta frequencies in all cortical sites which was significant in T3 and T4 with the auditory test and in all electrodes with the visual test. During auditory testing reduction in the alpha frequency was observed in frontotemporal regions. The greatest cortical variations of beta frequency occurred, in the facial test, in the electrodes O2, T6, O1, T5 and T3. The values of Hjorth complexity obtained varied within the interval 1 to 3, which was a considerably lower interval than that found in adult populations.</dc:description>
