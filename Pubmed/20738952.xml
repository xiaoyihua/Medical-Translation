<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Various cases of editors of leading journals resigning has led to a debate on the question of editorial independence, understood as the unconditional freedom of editors to approve the contents of their journals. METHOD An analysis is made of cases in which editorial independence has been questioned, as well as the position those who resolutely defend it against those who consider that it must be limited by the institutions of which they are their organs of expression. CONCLUSIONS Editors of scientific publications not only have to be judges of the articles they receive, but they must also be judged by their decisions, and editorial independence cannot be a refuge for personal stances. By independence it must be understood as the meticulousness in accepting manuscripts and the application of transparent criteria.</dc:description>
