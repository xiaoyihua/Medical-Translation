<dc:description xml:lang="en">Iron deficiency is common during the first years of life. Yet, there is a paucity of data on scholar children. Our main objective was to estimate the prevalence of ferropenic anemia in children 3 to 12 years of age living under conditions of poverty. A total of 323 children were included, 171 attended to a day care institution (group A) and 152 were from the same community but not attended in the day care institution (group B). Hemoglobin (Hb), medium corpuscular volume (MCV) and serum ferritin (SF) were measured in all children. In those with Hb &lt; or = 11 g/dl and/or MCV &lt; or = 73 fl and/or SF &lt; or = 15 microg/l, transferrin saturation (TS) and soluble transferrin receptors (sTR) were also measured. Iron deficiency was defined as SF &lt; or = 15 mg/l and ferropenic anemia was defined as Hb &lt; or = 11 g/dl or MCV &lt; or = 73 fl with sTR &gt; or = 38 mmol/l and SF &lt; or = 10 microg/l or TS &lt; or = 10%. There were no differences between the groups regarding age, weight, height, education, gender and housing conditions. Mean hemoglobin level was 12.6 g/dl (group A: 12.4 g/dl vs. group B: 12.7 g/dl; p=0.012), and mean SF was 45 mg/l, without significant differences between groups. Prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was 2.5% (8/323) and iron deficiency was 4.4% (14/317), without significant differences between groups. These results persisted after controlling for confounding variables. In this group of children living under conditions of poverty in Argentina, iron deficiency anemia was uncommon. We attribute this phenomenon to local affordability of some inexpensive cuts of red meat.</dc:description>
