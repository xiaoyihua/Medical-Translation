<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Test several methods that allow the differentiation between Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis, in an attempt to assess whether C. dubliniensis can be recovered from the oral cavity of teenagers wearing orthopedic oral prostheses. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twelve Candida strains were isolated from the prosthesis as well as the palatal mucosa in contact with the dental prosthesis from 12 teenager patients wearing orthopedic oral prostheses. Differentiation between C. albicans and C. dubliniensis was achieved by a number of phenotypic tests (carbon assimilation by the commercially available ID 32C test, growth at 45 grades C on Sabouraud glucose agar, abundant chlamydospore production on Casein agar, and reactivity with a C. dubliniensis antiserum) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serotyping of C. albicans was performed with monoclonal antibody B9E. RESULTS All 12 patients studied presented a Newton s type 2 denture stomatitis and in every patient the same Candida species were isolated from the prosthesis and the palatal mucosa in contact with the dental prosthesis. CHROMagar Candida and the germ tube test allowed the differentiation of isolates giving green colonies and a positive germ tube test from those giving violet colonies and a negative germ tube test. Only the isolate from patient 8 was stained by the C. dubliniensis antiserum and showed abundant chlamydospore production on Casein agar. Eight isolates did not grow at 45 grades C. Identification of all isolates was obtained by the ID 32C test. C. albicans was identified in 75% of patients, C. glabrata in 16,6% and C. dubliniensis in 8,3%. By using specific primers for typing C. dubliniensis, PCR allowed the identification of patient s 8 isolate as C. dubliniensis genotype 1. CONCLUSION C. dubliniensis can be isolated from the oral cavity of teenagers wearing orthopedic oral prostheses and it is possible and technically amenable, the differentiation between C. albicans y C. dubliniensis using the ID 32C test, the observation of abundant chlamydospore production on Casein agar, the reactivity with a C. dubliniensis antiserum and the PCR.</dc:description>
