<dc:description xml:lang="en">In 1991, we report drug interactions found through the review of 100 clinical charts of an Emergency Department. Two years later we evaluated again the medical indications done at the same Emergency. There were no differences related to sex, age and number of drug administrated by patient when compared with the former group. There was, however, a significant decrease in the percentage of interactions and those important ones. Also, in the average of interactions and those important ones by patient. Among more used drug, antacid occupied a a second place with 36% and Ranitidine the ninth place with 16%. Cimetidine disappeared among the first ten medications. In those cases where antacid or Ranitidine were indicated, there were interactions in 54% and 25%, respectively, but these interactions were not significant. The results of this new analysis point out a significant decrease of drug interactions, showing that continuing education allows indicate the most adequate therapy to each patient.</dc:description>
