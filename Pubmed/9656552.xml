<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the effects of removal of the bladder catheter 48 hours following transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia in relation to the length of hospital stay and the incidence of important postoperative complications. METHODS A study was conducted on 117 patients who had undergone TURP at our hospital over a period of one year. They were divided into two groups: group I comprised 55 patients in whom the bladder catheter had been systematically removed 48 hours following the procedure and had been discharged from hospital once they had attained a satisfactory micturition; group II comprised 62 patients in whom the bladder catheter was removed following conventional practice. RESULTS The mean length of hospital stay for the early catheter removal group was 2.02 days versus 3.85 days for group II. The postoperative complication rate was similar for both groups. CONCLUSIONS Early removal of the bladder catheter following TURP does not increase the complication rate. It shortens the length of hospital stay and reduces the cost of the procedure.</dc:description>
