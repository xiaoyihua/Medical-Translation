<dc:description xml:lang="en">The relation between height and weight is one of the criteria most widely used by doctors to evaluate nutritional condition. The simplest way to establish this relationship is to consult a chart that indicates what a person's weight should be in relation to his height. The charts for adults used in Mexico are deficient, since their design was based on popluations from other countries. In this study the advantages and limitations of this method for evaluating nutritional condition are pointed out and charts designed with data on Mexican university students are presented and compared with the charts that are most frequently being used in Mexico now.</dc:description>
