<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify risk factors associated with severity of injuries occurring in public streets of an urban area. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between February and April 2001, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among injured people seeking emergency care at three hospitals in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico. Information was also obtained for those who died on accident sites. Data on the following variables were collected: age, sex, alcohol intake, day and time of injury, prehospital care, external cause and nature of injury. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) was used to define severity of injuries. Data analysis consisted of descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate regression models. RESULTS A total of 492 injured people were included in the study; 23 of them died on site. The main cause of injuries was road traffic accidents (52%); 72% of injuries were not severe. Variables associated with the severity of injuries were: Road traffic accidents (odds ratio [OR] 6.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.52, 17.23), adjusted for age and schooling. CONCLUSION Road traffic injuries are the main cause of severe injuries. TheAIS is useful to assess the frequency and distribution of injury severity.</dc:description>
