<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report our series of testicular tumors diagnosed from June 1990 to June 1998. The diagnostic protocol, treatment and follow-up are described and data on patient survival over the 8-year period are presented. METHODS Our series comprised 21 testicular tumors; 19 germ cell and two non-germ cell tumors. There were 5 seminoma, three pure embryonary carcinoma, two mature cystic teratoma, 9 mixed germ cell tumor and two lymphoma. Treatment was by orchidectomy plus radiotherapy, chemotherapy and some cases were closely followed. RESULTS All 5 patients with seminoma are currently tumor-free, for a mean survival of 38.6 months. Of the 14 non-seminomatous tumors, there were two deaths; the remaining patients are in complete remission, for a mean survival of 37.5 months. The overall survival rate was more than 95% at a mean follow-up of 48 months. CONCLUSIONS Testicular tumor is one of the most common tumors in young male patients; germ cell tumors are the most frequent type. The different therapeutic regimens currently available have achieved a 5-year survival rate of more than 95%.</dc:description>
