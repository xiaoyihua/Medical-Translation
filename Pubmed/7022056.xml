<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors have carried a work in which they studied the Leishmaniasis of the skin and their cutaneo-mucosal manifestations, marking on the fact that both are caused by the same agent. They considered also that the visceral Leishmaniasis would be occasioned by the same parasite but in this latter case, it can occur only in anergic people. Finally, they made a clinical and pathologic classification of the cutaneous Leishmania and cutaneo-mucosal Leishmania in: 1. A primary period with 3 histologic manifestations very well known. 2. A period of latency which is variable in time of duration; some times is permanently with parasites in quiescent state in the cells of the reticulous endothelial system. 3. A period of reactivation with cutaneo-mucosal lesions, which shows 3 anatomic and clinic periods: erythematous edematous, granulomatous-proliferative and granulose-necrotic with very important destructions in oropharynx.</dc:description>
