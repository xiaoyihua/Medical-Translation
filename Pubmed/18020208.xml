<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To review our initial experience with laparoscopic radical cystectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between September 2004 and June 2006 we performed 16 laparoscopic radical cystectomies (14 males and 2 females) with a median age of 63.8 y.o. (51-85). 12 ileal neobladder (with laparoscopic ileal-urethra anastomosis), 3 cutaneous ureteroileostomies and 1 cutaneous ureterostomy were performed as derivation techniques. Median follow up was 12.4 months RESULTS Mean operation time was 340 minutes. Estimated blood loss was 350 ml. and 3 cases required intra-op blood transfusion. Mean hospitalization discharged was at 7.6 days. Median linph node dissection was 22.9 finding node metastasis in 6 cases. Most frequent complication was ileo in two cases. No local recurrentes in trocar placement was achieved. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic Radical cystectomy is a challenged long-lasting procedure but with the advantage of a less transfusion rate and short hospital stay. Oncologycal outcomes are similar as tose from open surgery.</dc:description>
