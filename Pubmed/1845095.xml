<dc:description xml:lang="en">From 1979 to 1988, 3890 positive samples for dermatophytes obtained at the Dermatology Service of Hospital San Juan de Dios (Western Santiago area) were analyzed for type of fungus involved and for relative yield of direct examination compared to culture. Direct examination was performed on samples treated with 20% KOH and stained with rhodamine. Cultures were obtained on Agar Sabouraud medium with addition of gentamycin and chloramphenicol. Yield of direct examination was 97.2% compared to 85% for culture. According to anatomic location, M canis was isolated from nearly all cases of T capitis. In cases of T pedis, nail mycosis, crural and palmar infections the most frequent species were T rubrum and T mentagrophytes M canis and T rubrum were responsible for infections of the body.</dc:description>
