<dc:description xml:lang="en">Infections in patients with connective tissue diseases (CTD) are associated to considerable morbidity and mortality. Some patients with CTD suffer a certain degree of immune deregulation inherent to their rheumatic disease. Other factors such as advanced age, and the coexistence of other chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus can also lead to the development of infection. Glucocoticosteroids induce a reduction in the synthesis of most of the known cytokines, an alteration in the migration of leukocytes from the blood with an alteration in antigen presentation and an abnormal cytotoxic response. Immunosuppresants fundamentally affect cellular immunity and its effect is related to the duration of treatment and dose. There is a clear relationship between the use of anti-TNF drugs and the reactivation of tuberculosis. Its clinical and histological manifestations are frequently atypical. In those cases in which active tuberculosis is suspected, anti-TNF must be suspended until infection is ruled out. Prophylactic treatment when faced with Pneumocystis jiroveci with cotrimoxazole has been recommended in patients that receive steroids and immunosuppressants, especially if the agent employed is cyclophosphmide or if lymphopenia develops.</dc:description>
