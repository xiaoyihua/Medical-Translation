<dc:description xml:lang="en">The article analyzes the history of Colônia Juliano Moreira (Juliano Moreira Colony) during the 1940s and early 1950s, in order to understand the relationship between mental health services and Brazilian national health policy at that time. Charts, newsletters, and medical reports of the institution are used as primary sources, as well as official documents issued by the office then in charge of psychiatric service, the Serviço Nacional de Doenças Mentais do Ministério da Educação e Saúde (Mental Disease National Service, under the Ministry of Education and Health). It observes how Colônia Juliano Moreira, created in 1924 as an agricultural colony, and based on praxitherapy as well as family therapy methods, has undergone an expansion of its physical and assistance resources within the Brazilian psychiatric health policy.</dc:description>
