<dc:description xml:lang="en">To assess the immunoclinical effectiveness of a biological response immunomodulator, we used AM3 (glycophosphopeptide ), a glucomannan polysaccharide extracted from the cell wall of a strain of Candida utilis, in 20 children with asthmatic bronchitis. They received 2 envelopes (1 g) daily for 4 months. The results were compared with a control group of 20 untreated children with the same pathology. The following clinical and immunological parameters were assessed in all of them: cough, dyspnea, expectoration, frequency and intensity of the bronchospasm, time of administration of the symptomatic medication, and the delayed cutaneous cells response by means of the intradermal reaction of 5 antigens (Trichophyton, Candida albicans, tuberculin, E. coli and bacterial antigens). In the treated group, the immunoferon (AM3) reduced the symptoms, the intensity and frequency of the bronchospasm, and the symptomatic medication (table I, II and III). In basal conditions, the 40 children presented a state of 75% anergy; after 4 months of treatment, the treated group experienced a 45% decrease in their anergic situation, variation which was statistically significant when compared with the control group. In our 20 treated patients, AM3 behaved like and immunostimulant, improving the clinical situation and progress in patients with infectious respiratory disorders. We consider that the immunoferon constitutes a coadjuvant therapy to bacterial immunotherapy.</dc:description>
