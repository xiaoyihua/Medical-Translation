<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND During the years 2008 and 2009, 1,191 biomedical articles authored by Chilean investigators working in Chile were indexed in PubMed. AIMS To evaluate the potential visibility of those articles, according to scientometric indexes of the journals where they were published. METHODS Those journals where the articles had been published were identified and each journal&#146;s Impact Factor (JIF), 5-year JIF, SCImago Journal Rank (SJR), SCImago Quartiles (Q) for 2010 and the Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP) for 2008-2009 were identified. RESULTS Three hundred and twelve articles (26,2%) were dedicated to experimental studies in animals, tissues or cells and they were classified as &#147;Biomedicine&#148;, while 879 (73,8%) were classified as &#147;Clinical Medicine&#148;; in both areas the main type of articles were original reports (90% and 73.6%, respectively). Revista Médica de Chile and Revista Chilena de Infectología concentrated the greater number of publications. Articles classified in Biomedicine were published more frequently in English and in journals with higher scientometric indexes than those classified in Clinical Medicine. CONCLUSIONS Biomedical articles dealing with clinical topics, particularly case reports, were published mostly in national journals or in foreign journals with low scientometric indexes. It can be partly attributable to the authors&#146; interest in reaching local readers. The evaluation of research productivity should combine several scientometric indexes, selected according to the field of research, the institution's and investigators&#146; interests, with a qualitative and multifactorial assessment.</dc:description>
