<dc:description xml:lang="en">The management of intra-abdominal testis can be challenging, as evidenced by the multiple methods suggested for its assessment and treatment. In this paper, we report our long-term results for our 14-year surgical experience with laparoscopic management. Methods. Retrospective study of laparoscopic interventions performed at our department for nonpalpable testes between 1996 and 2009. In 174 procedures, we found 72 intra-abdominal testes (5 bilateral) and 25 direct orchiopexies (3 bilateral) were performed. One-stage Fowler-Stephens orchiopexies (FSO) were performed in 5 children. 40 boys underwent the two-stage FSO technique (2 bilateral) in those that reached the contralateral inguinal ring. The second stage was performed in 4 cases with a laparoscopic approach, the rest of them underwent an inguinal procedure exclusively. Mean age for the first intervention was 3.7 yrs, and the second stage was performed on average after 10.9 months. Of 42 undescended testes, 22 were on the right side and 20 on the left side. Median followup was 24 months. Results. Of 42 two-stage FSOs performed, 27 surgeries were very successful, with a testis size equivalent to the contralateral mate; 7 had good results, with a smaller testis (volume up to 50% of contralateral); and 7 resulted in atrophic testis. No complications were encountered during surgery. Conclusions. There is no doubt about the usefulness of laparoscopy for intra-abdominal testes with short spermatic vessels, and the two-stage Fowler-Stephens technique should be the procedure of choice given its high success rate.</dc:description>
