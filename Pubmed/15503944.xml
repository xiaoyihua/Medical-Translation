<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION There are many clinical situations in wich it may be difficult to perform appropriately an anastomosis between the renal pelvis and the proximal portion of the uretersafely. Preservation of the organ depens upon the availability of surgical resources. In fact, that principle becomes particularipy significant when dealing with children. OBJECTIVES To describe different clinical and surgical situations in wich the successful performance of ureterocalicostomy has enable us to maintain three renal units with function from child patients and without complications. METHOD AND PATIENTS Three children aged 8, 4 and 1 year were submitted to surgery because of pyelocaliceal lithiasis in the first case and secundary ureteropelvic stenosis in the remaning two cases. RESULTS With a median follow-up of 12 months, all three renal units were preserved and, according to the isotopic study, functionality was improved in the two cases of ureteropelvic obstruction and the normal preoperative function was preserved in the first case. No complications occurred either during the immediate postoperative period or up to the date of this review. CONCLUSION Ureterocalicostomy should be considered a suitable alternative in different clinical situations in wich the ureteropelvic continuity could be compromised, or in cases of indundibulopelvic stenosis.</dc:description>
