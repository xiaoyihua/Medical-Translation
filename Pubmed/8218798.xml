<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to assess the incidence of tuberculous disease in our health area, we reviewed the clinical records of patients from the three hospitals of the area under study during the years 1989, 1990 and 1991, who had positive bacilloscopy, positive Lowenstein's culture in any specimen and/or compatible anatomopathologic report. After excluding 26 patients because they belonged to other health areas, 885 patients remained in the study, out of which 251 (64% men and 36% women) were from the year 1989, 270 (64% men and 36% women) from the year 1990 and 364 (62% men and 38% women) from the year 1991. The mean age was 38.4 (SD 20.5). Fifty-one percent of the patients were between 20 and 35 years old. The rate of new cases was 65.87 per 100.000 population in 1989, 71.05 in 1990 and 95.53 in 1991. Seventy-four cases were HIV-positive (8%). Tuberculous meningitis was present in 12 patients. The highest mortality was 1.79 per 100.000 population in 1990. We conclude that tuberculosis presents a medium-high incidence in our health area.</dc:description>
