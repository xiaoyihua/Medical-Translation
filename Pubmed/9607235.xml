<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine prevalence and type of obesity; and, secondarily, to determine the prevalence of factors of cardiovascular risk in obese patients. DESIGN Descriptive observational study. SETTING Catchment area of an urban Health Centre. PARTICIPANTS People over 14 and of both sexes registered at the Health Centre. INTERVENTIONS 270 people were contacted, of whom 191 (70.7%) were finally studied for weight, size and Quetelet index. When this index was 25 or over, the waist/hip index was studied. RESULTS The prevalence of obesity for the whole population registered at the Health Centre was 13.5% (15.4% in men, 12.1% in women). Prevalence increased with age, and was highest for both sexes in the 65-74 age-group (28%). The type of obesity prevalence has resulted 84.6% for android type and 15.3% for gynecoid. CONCLUSIONS Obesity is a first-order problem, not only because of its high prevalence and the greater frequency of the male type, but because of the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in obese people.</dc:description>
