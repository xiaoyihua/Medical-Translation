<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The practice of the Islamic precept of Ramadan (R) imposes to those who practice it important physiological and psychological changes due to the water and dietary restrictions they are subjected to, which has a particular impact on the Muslim students' physical and psychological performances, particularly in multicultural Western societies, where there are no schedule adjustments in daily activities. Among the changes in lifestyle, consequently, the dietary changes are stressed, both qualitative and quantitative. Due to the importance of this issue and facing the limited knowledge the Muslim teenagers who live in non-Islamic societies have about the effects of Ramadan, it is suggested as main objective of this study the analysis of changes in nutrients during R in a group of Muslim students of both sexes, in order to solve and prevent some of the problems shown in this period. MATERIALS AND METHODS 55 Muslim youngsters were selected (24 men and 31 women) aged between 15 and 18, who practise R; and the diet was analysed by inventory over 3 days, one week before fasting and in the second week during it. RESULTS In R there are no relevant changes in caloric intake. The consumption of carbohydrates and proteins is increased, and that of fat is decreased. DISCUSSION the changes in R lead to a diet more regulated to nutritional recommendations; and to this seems to have contributed the fact that the participants took their meals at home, where, in spite of the Western cut of the population, it is felt an important influence of North African traditions and habits, due to its border contact with Morocco.</dc:description>
