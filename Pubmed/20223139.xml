<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Paratesticular tumors are rare. Most of them are benign, and adenomatoid tumors are most common. These tumors sometimes infiltrate the testicular parenchyma and require differential diagnosis with malignant tumors. In such cases, intraoperative biopsy allows for performing conservative surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study of nine patients with paratesticular adenomatoid tumors seen during a nine-year period (2000-2008) is reported. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Patient age (mean, 49.6 years) and most common initial signs (tender nodule) are reported. The tumor most commonly occurred as a small, usually oval, nodule in the tail of epididymis. Our series included a case each of intraparenchymal tumor of the testis and tumor of the tunica vaginalis. Diagnosis was initially made based on a ultrasound scan and subsequently confirmed by histology. Differential diagnosis and surgical treatment, performed in all patients, are reported, and also the pathological features of surgical specimens.</dc:description>
