<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Pancreatic diseases such as cancer, idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis, and chronic pancreatitis, can cause pain that is difficult to control. Pain is one of the most debilitating symptoms and demands increasing doses of analgesics and narcotics, as well as the number of hospital admissions, with a direct implication in the costs of medical treatments. OBJECTIVE To describe the experience with 2 paediatric patients who were subjected to an ultrasound-guided endoscopic celiac ganglion block for difficult pain management, secondary to chronic pancreatitis disease. CLINICAL CASES The first case concerns a 9-year-old male with a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, and the second case is a 12-year-old female who developed episodes of intermittent acute pancreatitis. Both cases suffered from chronic abdominal pain, which was difficult to control with stronger painkillers, such as opioids. The pain decreased after patients were subjected to an ultrasound-guided endoscopic celiac ganglion block. CONCLUSIONS This technique showed that both patients obtained satisfactory pain relief, with significant improvements in general symptomatology and the stopping of almost all analgesic medication. The authors suggest that celiac ganglion block must be considered, and implemented early before the usual complications, such as a consumption syndrome that is frequent in paediatric patients with chronic pancreatitis.</dc:description>
