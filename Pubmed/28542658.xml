<dc:description xml:lang="en">Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the most common renal replacement therapy used in pediatric patients with end stage renal disease. This population has a mortality rate 1,000 times greater compare to pediatric population, mainly due to cardiovascular causes. OBJECTIVE To characterize pediatric patients on chronic PD in relation to dialysis and cardiovascular outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS Cross sectional study. Patients in stable PD according to DOQI criteria were selected. Epidemiological, dialytic, biochemical and cardiovascular variables were registered. Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI) was calculated by height/age (g/m2.7). Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) was diagnosed with &gt; 38.6 g/m2.7, severe LVH &gt; 51 g/m2.7. Data were analyzed using STATA 11.0. continuous variables using ANOVA test and categorical variables were analyzed using χ2 test or Fisher&#146;s exact test. RESULTS 21 patients, 11 males. Mean age 9.2 ± 3.52 years. The most frequent diagnosis was renal dysplasia (52%). Residual and Peritoneal KtV were 0.8 and 1.9 respectively. Fifty-two percent of patients showed LVH, 91% in severe range. A significant relationship between ultrafiltration/m2 and systolic blood pressure was depicted. Also a significant relationship between left ventricular mass index and hemoglobin (p &lt; 0.05) was founded. CONCLUSIONS The majority of the population showed left ventricular hypertrophy -particularly severe LVH-, which confirms an increased CV risk in this population. Blood pressure and loss of ultrafiltration were founded to be correlated to LVH.</dc:description>
