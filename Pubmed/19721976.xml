<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Assessing the relationship between knowledge, attitudes and practice regarding high-risk sexual behaviour in adolescent sexuality as well as the structure and perception of family functionality. METHODS Cross-sectional research was carried out on a population of 13,699 adolescents (ages ranging from 10 to 19) attending 12 public schools from the conurbation of Suba. A self-questionnaire was administered, focusing on sexual behaviour, knowledge, attitudes and the structure and perception of family dynamics. RESULTS Average age was 13.5. Sexual activity prevalence was 17%. 8% of households suffered from severe dysfunction. 39% of households were incomplete nuclear ones. Females reported less sexual activity than males (0.53 OR; 0.47-0.59 95%CI). Sexual activity was more common when adolescents perceived family dysfunction (2.06 OR; 1.72-2.48 95%CI). CONCLUSIONS Perception of family function was more important than structure as a risk factor in youngsters' sexuality.</dc:description>
