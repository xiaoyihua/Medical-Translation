<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Many studies in Western countries point to the high prevalence of HIV infection in groups of prostitutes especially among those using intravenous drugs (IVDA). Furthermore, there appears to be a low but increasing number of heterosexually infected prostitutes. METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out in a sample of 374 prostitutes selected by collaborating groups in 11 provinces with the aim of studying the prevalence of HIV and its associated risk factors in Spanish prostitutes. Furthermore, the prevalence of other sexually transmitted diseases (HIV-2, HTLV-I/II, hepatitis B and syphilis), the frequency of different sexual activities and the use of condoms were investigated in this group. The data were collected by interview using a previously tested questionnaire. RESULTS Serological analysis demonstrated that 54 persons were positive for HIV-1 (16%), none for HIV-2, 1 for HTLV-I/II, 113 for hepatitis B (46%) and 84 for syphilis (25%). The main risk factor for HIV infection was IVDA; 60% of this group was positive vs 3% of the non IVDA (OR = 47.6; confidence interval 18.4-128.0). Consistent condom use in this population is low, although it varies according to the type of relation and sexual partner. Forty-nine percent of the women having vaginal relations with their customers reported using condoms at all times or almost all times vs 36% for anal relations and 22% for oral relations. These percentages were reduced to 10%, 6% and 3%, respectively with private sexual partners. CONCLUSIONS Studies concerning HIV prevalence and its associated risk factors in Spanish prostitutes should be continued in order to monitor trends in HIV infection and the use of protective measures.</dc:description>
