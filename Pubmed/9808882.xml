<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Analysis of the spectrum of diseases attributed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with coinfection with the immunodeficiency virus (HIV). METHODS Retrospective study of 35 cases of coinfection with P. aeruginosa-HIV, attended from 1985 until 1995. Analysis of putative factors implicated in mortality secondary to P. aeruginosa infection. RESULTS The spectrum of infection due to P. aeruginosa was: ORL infection (4 cases), infection of upper respiratory tract (4 cases), pneumonia (21 cases), infected bronchiectasias (one case), endocarditis (2 cases) and primary bacteremia (3 cases). Most of these infections were community-acquired ones (30 cases [85.7%]). Degree of immunodepression was variable, with 12 cases (34.3%) affecting to patients with more than 200 CD4+lymphocytes x 10(-9)/l. Radiological pattern of pneumonias consisted in alveolar consolidation (18 cases [85.7%]), necrotizing pneumonia (2 cases [9.5%]) and interstitial pattern (one case [4.8%]). More than a 80% of isolates of P. aeruginosa was sensible to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, aminoglycosides, ureidopenicillins and imipenem. Recidives of the P. aeruginosa infection were detected in 7 cases (20%): 4 cases of ORL infection (100%) and 3 cases of lower respiratory tract infection (13.6%). Overall mortality was a 20% (7 cases), being directly attributed to P. aeruginosa infection in every one of the cases, all of them pneumonias. Secondary bacteremia was associated to a higher mortality (odds ratio [OR] 18.67; p = 0.0207). CONCLUSIONS P. aeruginosa affect to the HIV-infected patients, independently of their immunodepression degree, affecting to different localizations. This bacteria continues to be sensible to conventional anti-Pseudmonas treatment. Pneumonia with secondary bacteremia is associated to a higher mortality.</dc:description>
