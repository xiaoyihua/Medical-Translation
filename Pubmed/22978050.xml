<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in pediatric patients with neurological disorders from Zulia State, Venezuela, during the period 2007-2008. Samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum were obtained from 186 patients with neurological symptoms and bacteriological negative CSF. The albumin CSF/serum content was determined to rule out contamination of CSF and optimal pairs were determined by ELISA of IgM and IgG anti-CMV antibodies in serum and IgG in CSF. Only 40.86% (76/186) of patients were optimal for this study. Serum samples positive for IgM antibodies (2/76; 2.6%) and IgG antibodies (71/76; 93.4%) were obtained. CSF IgG antibodies were observed in 24/76 patients (31.6%). Increased values of glucose in CSF (p &lt; 0.05) were observed in 58.3% of CMV patients with meningoencephalitis. In addition, increased CSF protein concentration (p &lt; 0.01) was observed in CSF anti-CMV antibodies positive patients with meningitis. This study shows high prevalence of acute CMV infection in pediatric patients with neurological affections suggesting an important role of this virus in this pathology during the studied period.</dc:description>
