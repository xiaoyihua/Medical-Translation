<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) an association with a polymorphism in the endothelin gene (EDN1) has been described. The main objective of this study was to analyze the polymorphism K198N in the gene EDN1 in patients with PAH, correlating the results with clinical and hemodynamic parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS We compared 41 patients diagnosed with idiopathic and associated PAH of group i with 50 healthy controls. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to analyze the polymorphism K198N. We compared the genotype distribution and searched for a correlation with clinical, hemodynamic and therapeutic response. RESULTS Genotype GG was present in 42% of patients in this study and 65% of controls. The GT+TT genotypes appeared in 58% of patients and in 35% of controls. Statistically significant differences between patients and controls (P=.032) were detected, with a relative risk in carriers of having the T allele of 2.51 (95% CI 1.07 to 5.86). The analysis by PolyPhen software defined K198N change as pathogenic. No significant differences in the response to treatment at medium term were found. CONCLUSIONS The genotype analysis of the EDN1 gene polymorphism shows statistically significant differences in patients with PAH compared to healthy individuals. Individuals carrying at least one T allele exhibit a higher relative significant risk to develop HAP.</dc:description>
