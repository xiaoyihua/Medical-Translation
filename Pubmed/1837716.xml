<dc:description xml:lang="en">Using a modified cluster sample design, skin tests with two TU PPD were performed on 4,083 first-grade children (mean age 6,7 years) in the state of Jalisco, Mexico, to estimate the annual risk of infection from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The proportion of PPD reactions (a diameter of 10 mm or more of induration) was 7.6% in the Guadalajara metropolitan area and 5.5% in the rest of Jalisco. In the total sample, the proportion was 7.4% among children with scars attributed to BCG vaccine and 4.5% in children without BCG scars. The weighted proportion of children with PPD reactions of 10 mm or more was 6.8% statewide. The average annual risk of infection estimated from the group that had not received BCG vaccine was 0.82%. The results suggest that the incidence of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis is almost 10 times greater than the number of cases registered annually in Jalisco.</dc:description>
