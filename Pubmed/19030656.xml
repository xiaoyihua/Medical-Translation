<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Orthopedic surgery is commonly performed in elderly patients with higher cardiovascular surgical risk. Hemodynamic monitoring in these patients may prevent perioperative complications. AIM To assess the usefulness of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for intraoperative cardiovascular monitoring during orthopedic surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients older than 65 years subjected to orthopedic surgery using general anesthesia and with a high cardiovascular risk were studied. Intraoperative TEE was performed to assess intravascular volume, myocardial contractility and the presence of myocardial ischemia. RESULTS Fifty three patients aged 72+/-5 years were studied. Hemodynamic stability was detected in 68% of patients, mainly reflected as episodes of hypovolemia. Myocardial ischemia was detected in two patients and embolic episodes in six (11%). CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative TEE was useful for the hemodynamic evaluation of patients with high cardiovascular risk.</dc:description>
