<dc:description xml:lang="en">During the last decade, a number of epidemiological and laboratory investigations have shown a close association among hepatitis B, dietary exposure to aflatoxin, and an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. An immunoenzymatic method for aflatoxin detection in urine was developed and assessed at the National Institute of Oncology. Fifty four children (age range 4-16 years) from the pediatric service at the National Institute of Gastroenterology were studied. Thirty patients had a diagnosis of chronic active hepatitis (CHA 17 of which 56%) were found aflatoxin- positive, 20 where HbsAg-positive carriers of which 7 of 35% were positive to aflatoxin, and 4 patients suffered from metabolic diseases from which 1 (25%) was found aflatoxin- positive. Controls and patients were matched by age, with 7.5% of aflatoxin-positive patients. Our results confirm the link between hepatitis B and aflatoxin in this type of patients compared to controls. The immunoenzymatic system proved to be specific for aflatoxin detection with a sensitivity of 100 picograms/milliliter.</dc:description>
