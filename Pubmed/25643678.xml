<dc:description xml:lang="en">Through the period 2003-2012, a temporal and geographical analysis was performed to characterize the snakebite envenoming in the state of Veracruz. Bite records were obtained during this decade and the incidence rate per year was estimated in order to evaluate its spatial and temporal distribution. Furthermore, a smoothed rate of snakebites was calculated per municipality. Snakebite rates have remained constant over time, in spite of fluctuations, which suggest that better prevention strategies are necessary to reduce this phenomenon. Municipalities with the highest smoothed rate are located in the northern portion of the state.</dc:description>
