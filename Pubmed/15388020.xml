<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Analyze the effect of AM3, an oral immunomodulator, on the exacerbations and on the use of antibiotics in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). DESIGN Systematic search of controlled clinical trials that used AM3 in some treatment group and that included data on the clinical effects of this drug on patients with COPD. SELECTED VARIABLES: Nine studies were detected in which the clinical effectiveness of AM3 was evaluated in relation to the number of infectious exacerbations, their length, and the length of the antibiotic treatment used. RESULTS In comparison with placebo group, the average number of excaerbations suffered by the patients treated with AM3 declined significantly in 0.31 units (p &lt; 0.001; 95% confidence interval: 0.20-0.42), without heterogeneity among the different studies (Q = 6.62; p &gt; 0.43). With regard to the average length of the exacerbations and the average length of the antibiotic treatment used for the exacerbations, both variables declined significantly in the group treated with AM3 (3.10 days, p &lt; 0.001, and 8.07 days, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) but this positive effect could not be confirmed because trials were close to heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS The results of this systematic review show that AM3 has a clinical effect in the prevention of exacerbations of COPD patients because reduces significantly their number. This could be related to a slowing in the progression of the deterioration in the respiratory function with a potential impact on the quality of life of the patients. Furthermore, these data imply a positive therapeutic result and a possible decline in development of bacterial resistances secondary to the frequent and indiscriminate use of antibiotics in these patients.</dc:description>
