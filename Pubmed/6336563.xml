<dc:description xml:lang="en">A total of 49 serotypes were isolated in Argentina during the triennium 1979-1981, from 3,665 Salmonella strains isolated from different sources: human, animal, food and water. The degree of correlation among every one of them was analyzed in order to establish their influence in the cycles of transmission and human infection. S. typhimurium prevailed in human materials, being also isolated from water and animal, although in a smaller degree. Something similar occurred with S. oranienburg. It was observed that S. typhi retained its usual feature of endemic disease. Other serotypes of Salmonella were also found, particularly: S. paratyphi, S. panama, S. derby, S. agona, S. bredeney, S. newport, S. anatum and S. montevideo. From 3,665 Salmonella strains studied, 73.73% were isolated from human sources and the other 26.27% from non human sources, 5.40% corresponding to animal isolations, 15.39% from water and 5.48% from food.</dc:description>
