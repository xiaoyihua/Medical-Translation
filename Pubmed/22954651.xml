<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the baseline prevalence and incidence rates of Impaired Gas Exchange (IGE), Ineffective Airway Clearance (IAC) and Ineffective Breathing Pattern (IBP) in children with acute respiratory infection. METHOD A prospective open cohort study was conducted in two public hospitals specialized in child care in the months from January to June of 2011. The sample consisted of 136 children with acute respiratory infection, which lasted a minimum of six and maximum of ten consecutive days. The data were collected through examination of the child and interviews with their parents. The diagnostic inference process was developed by trained nurses. RESULTS The three diagnoses showed high rates at the beginning of follow-up period, with a reduction in the days after. There were similar rates of IBP and IGE. The temporal development of IBP was similar to that of IAC, but in lower proportions. Incidence rates in cases per 100 person / day were to IAC 39.28, 17.04 for DIG, and 13.31 for PRI. CONCLUSION The three diagnoses studied appeared early and in high proportions. New cases of IAC appear more quickly when compared to the other two diagnoses.</dc:description>
