<dc:description xml:lang="en">Tobacco smoking habit has been considered like an important cause of diabetes mellitus complications. Health education efficiency has been supported by many experiences in order to promote tobacco withdrawal by personal counselling with a direct nurse role at primary health care level. This study was carried out by all this information with tre straight goal of describing changes in the diabetic tobacco behaviour after a stepped counselling and a primary care nurse following. Description details are given of the smoking diabetic population counselled and listed at the same time in a nurse control clinic over a 18 months period. A Smokers Helping Scheme (SHS) was used. SHS understood that tobacco withdrawal is behavioural changing process with a few steps. Smokers were given with special written material for thes purpose. Results data were caught by the researchers from the chronical patient's census and from the tobacco program control sheets. Tobacco withdrawal was verified by espirated air CO determination (Smokorlizar system) and has been maintained by the 25% of managed diabetic people in this investigation. We strongly believe that nursing diabetic tobacco counselling by SHS acts like a behavioural modificator as results are showing. Health state improvement and a better life quality have been got on the diabetic people that has been managed.</dc:description>
