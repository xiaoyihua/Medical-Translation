<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Lately, autopsies are performed less frequently in hospitals, despite their importance as a diagnostic tool. AIM To study the concordance between clinical diagnosis and postmortem study in patients that died in a teaching hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS Autopsy findings in 57 patients (aged 16 to 85 years old, 28 female) that died at a University hospital were analyzed. Clinical diagnoses were compared with those of the postmortem examination and the degree of concordance between both diagnoses was calculated. RESULTS Seven major omissions (12.3%), whose knowledge could have changed the clinical course of patients, were detected. These omissions occurred in patients with complex diseases or due to limitations of diagnostic procedures. Also, seven omissions, found in severely ill patients, whose knowledge would not change the patient's evolution, were also detected. CONCLUSIONS Autopsy still is a valuable tool to assess the quality of care for patients that die during their hospitalization.</dc:description>
