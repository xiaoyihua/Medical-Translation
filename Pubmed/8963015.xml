<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS To find out the prevalence of breastfeeding in the Health District of Córdoba, taking into account the basic health areas it is composed of; to find out if breastfeeding is less frequent in lower social classes than in high ones and the influence of health centers on breastfeeding. DESIGN Cross-sectional descriptive study. Home survey. SITE: Health District of Córdoba, urban area. SUBJECTS 1, 3, 6 months old babies taken from the computerized newborn register of the Health District of Córdoba. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Age of the babies; breastfeeding, social class, primary care model (basic health areas attended by Health Centers or not attended by Health Centers), weight at birth, parents' jobs, pregnancy control, maternal education and number of visits. 77.2% of the mothers start breastfeeding. 51.7% of one month-old babies are breastfed. One out of four three-month-old babies are breastfed and one out of ten six-month-old babies are breastfed. Low weight at birth has a negative influence on breastfeeding. The prevalence of breastfeeding is higher in favoured classes, and in the basic health areas attended by health centers. The rest of variables analyzed are not significant. CONCLUSIONS The health centers improve the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding.</dc:description>
