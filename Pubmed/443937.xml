<dc:description xml:lang="en">In 127 cases (70 with cardiopathy, 41 with arteriopathy and 16 normals) a "chronomethryc clinical exploration" was performed. This procedure consists in obtaining an electrocardiogram at the same time a clinical examination is performed and in the very moment of the occurrence of a physical or oscilometric phenomenon the standardization marker of the electrocardiogram is actioned to register a mark indicating a Q-phenomenon interval. 3 of this intervals are measured for each clinical phenomenon and the two closest values are averaged. This method is based in the fact that the time of human reaction varies relatively little when 2 successive similar phenomena are appreciated (for ej.: 0.158 sec. +/- 0.036 (SD) and 0.154 sec. +/- 0.042 (SD), n = 32, P = non significant for the first and 2nd. auscultated cardiac sounds). In this way the following intervals were estimated: acustyc systole (n = 52), 2nd. sound-opening mitral snap interval (n = 17), duration of systolic cardiac murmur (n = 22), mechanic systole (n = 14), left ventricular eyection time (n = 15), and IIa-O interval (n = 17) and compared with their respectives phonographyc or apicography values with correlations coefficients of 0.58, 0.83, 0.73, 0.58, 0.70, and 0.70, respectively. The sistolic murmurs were classified in proto, meso or telesystolic and a good correlation was found with the phonography (method in 91.0% of cases). This procedure also identified correctly a left IV sound (n = 8) even in cases in which this sign formed a complex with the first heart sound.</dc:description>
