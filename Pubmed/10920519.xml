<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To find the theoretical and practical knowledge concerning inhalation systems of primary care doctors, postgraduates in training--family &amp; community medicine (FCM) residents--and undergraduates who had passed their course in pneumology. DESIGN Crossover, descriptive study. SETTING FCM teaching unit of the Puerta del Mar Hospital (Cadiz), the Cadiz Faculty of Medicine and seven primary care centres on the Bay of Cadiz. PARTICIPANTS 31 practising primary care doctors, 25 third-year FCM residents and 31 medical students were evaluated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A thirteen-point questionnaire was used to evaluate the subjects theoretical knowledge of inhalation systems. The percentage of correct replies was used to establish reply levels. Their techniques of handling different systems of inhalation (pressurised cartridge, pressurised cartridge with spacing chamber, Turbuhaler and Accuhaler) were assessed according to the guidelines of the SEPAR (Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery). 26% of the practising doctors and residents answered over 75% of the questionnaire correctly, with no significant differences between the two groups (p &gt; 0.66). No undergraduate reached 75% of correct answers. After exclusion of asthmatic participants, three of the practising doctors (9.7%) and one of the residents (4.8%) performed the technique correctly with the four systems: there were no differences between the two groups (p &gt; 0.87). No undergraduate performed them satisfactorily. CONCLUSIONS Specific training for primary care doctors in handling inhalation therapy is recommended.</dc:description>
