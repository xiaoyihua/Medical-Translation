<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of the present study was to compare the BacT/ALERT blood culture automatic management and reading system (Organon Teknika) with a conventional, nonautomatic technique (DUO, Bio-Mérieux). METHODS 1,405 blood cultures were parallel compared. 263 of them were positive; out of these, 148 were considered as indicative of septicaemia, 38 of doubtful clinical significance and 77 as accidental contaminations. RESULTS No differences were detected between both systems neither in the number of isolates obtained nor in the kind of microorganisms recovered or in the number of false-positive or false-negative readings. The conventional system detected 28% of significant isolates during the first 24 hours, reaching 77% after 48 hours; whereas the BacT/ALERT system had detected 57% of significant isolates after 12 hours, reaching 82% after 24 hours (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The results obtained and the automatization of the BacT/ALERT system appoint it as a firm candidate to be included into the Clinical Microbiology laboratory routine.</dc:description>
