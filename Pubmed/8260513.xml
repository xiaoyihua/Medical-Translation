<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to confirm the Sierra del Sueve (Asturias) as an endemic area for Lyme's disease and determine the seroprevalence of this disease in inhabitants of this and other zones of Asturias. METHODS A taxonomic study of 233 ticks in this county was carried out and the rate of infection by Borrelia burgdorferi was determined by culture in modified Kelly medium. Seroprevalence of Lyme's disease was studied by enzyme-immunoanalysis IgG-IgM in 150 inhabitants from several counties of Asturias. RESULTS The tick Ixodes ricinus is the most abundant species in the zone. All the cultures of Ixodes for Borrelia burgdorferi were negative. Among the farmers of the area of Sueve, seroprevalence of Lyme's disease was higher than in other population groups. CONCLUSIONS The Sierra del Sueve is an endemic area of Lyme's disease because of the appropriate vector I. ricinus and the super-population of Fallow deer. In this county the percentage of asymptomatic seropositives for this disease is much higher than that of other zones in Spain.</dc:description>
