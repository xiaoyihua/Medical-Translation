<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the usefulness of the Shortened Directly Observed Treatment (DOT,S) applied to the Tuberculosis Control Program in Chiapas, Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS The efficacy and efficiency of treatment was evaluated in a cohort of pulmonary tuberculosis patients confirmed by baciloscopy, who were subjected to treatment under one of three different regimes, self-administered, supervised and DOT,S from January to June 1996. RESULTS Efficacy was 90.9%, 97.7% and 100% for self-administered, supervised and DOT,S treatment, respectively. Efficiency was 68.1%, 77.6% and 88.5% in the same order. CONCLUSIONS For public health ends, the DOT,S proved to be the most efficient in the control of tuberculosis, since healing rates were increased and this reduces sources of disease transmission.</dc:description>
