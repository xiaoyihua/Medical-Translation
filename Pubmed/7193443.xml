<dc:description xml:lang="en">Following a brief historical introduction, we review the currently accepted clinical, etiological and hemodynamic classifications of the cardiomyopathies. The typical clinical and hemodynamic pattern of each variety, as well as a description of the echocardiographic data which raises the suspicion or supports the diagnosis of the particular cardiomyopathy are discussed. We attempt to demonstrate the usefulness of echocardiography as a non-invasive procedure in the doubtful cases of cardiomyopathy, without exposing the patient to the risks of the invasive procedures. The echocardiographic data of hypertrophic abnormalities of the intraventricular septum, mitral valve, aortic valve, free wall of the left ventricle and cardiac function are presented. The association of valvular heart disease an cardiomyopathy is considered. The differential diagnosis of valvular heart disease which present with echocardiographic abnormalities similar to those of the cardiomyopathies is discussed. We have reviewed the most important literature and have illustrated some of our cases. The future of the procedure in the early diagnosis during the asymptomatic period of the disease in the evaluation of the natural evolution of the illness and the patient's response to therapy is presented.</dc:description>
