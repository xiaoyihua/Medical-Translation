<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To relate our experience in treating postprostatectomy stress urinary incontinence (SUI) with the male Remeex system (MRS). We also list the elements that comprise this system, the implantation technique and its proper adjustment. Similarly, we attempt to determine whether the latest changes made to this device, which constitute the MRS-II, have resulted in fewer mesh readjustments. MATERIAL AND METHOD From March 2007 to March 2014, we operated on 24 men with postprostatectomy SUI between the ages of 55 and 78 years (mean, 67 years), through the placement of a Remeex suburethral tension-adjustable sling. All patients had severe urinary incontinence, with considerable impact on their quality of life. RESULTS All patients, except for 2 who required the removal of the system, remained continent. Nine of the patients (39%) occasionally required incontinence pads when performing intense physical exercise. The mean number of adjustments was 2.4 (range 0-6). The score on the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ 7) performed before the surgery and 6 months after, went from 79±7 points to 11±3, with a very high degree of satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS The MRS is a valid therapeutic option for postprostatectomy incontinence and is a reproducible technique that is easy to perform, has a low rate of complications and provides excellent and lasting results. There is also a clear trend towards reducing number of adjustments with the new MRS-II.</dc:description>
