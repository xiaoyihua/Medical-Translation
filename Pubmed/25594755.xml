<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To establish the efficiency and adverse effects of the addition of bismuth subsalicylate to triple eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS Double blind controlled experimental trial. The study population consisted of 54 patients with Helicobacter pylori infection: 29 were allocated to the experimental group, who received the usual triple plus bismuth subsalicylate therapy, and 24 received the triple therapy plus placebo. RESULTS The average age was 47+-14.9 years, 66.7% of the patients were women. Both groups underwent the breath test: it was negative in 89.7% of the patients from the experimental group and 80% of the patients from the placebo group (p=0.319). The adverse events of both groups were: diarrhea (10.3% in the experimental group vs 16% in the placebo group; p=0.537), dark feces (37.9% in the experimental group vs 0% in the placebo group; p=0.001), abdominal pain (20.7% in the experimental group vs 52% in the placebo group; p=0.016). Nausea only were present in 3% of the patients of placebo group p=0.055). CONCLUSIONS The association of bismuth subsalicylate to the triple therapy scheme for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori was effective in 89.7% of patients, whereas 80% of efficiency in the experimental group.</dc:description>
