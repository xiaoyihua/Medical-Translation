<dc:description xml:lang="en">This is a pilot study realized in the San Juan City Hospital Pediatric Emergency Room to determine the efficacy of the short-term use of corticosteroids in pediatric patients (5 to 6 years old) with the diagnosis of acute bronchial asthma during the months of March to June 1992. Twenty three (23) cases were evaluated, of which, 8 cases were excluded because they did not comply with the eligibility criterias. The treatment was implemented in a random fashion, which consisted of one control group of treatment with different corticosteroids in combination with albuterol. The patients were evaluated at 0, 2, 6, 12 and 24 hr of therapy a pulmonary index, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and pulse oximeter saturation. On admission to the study the average pulmonary index was 6 and PEFR of less than -3sd. When the patients achieved a pulmonary index of &lt; 4, PEFR &gt; 70% and pulse oxygen saturation of &gt; 95% they were discharged. They were reevaluated at 5 to 7 days and 10 to 14 days after discharge. Using the same objective parameters patients that used corticosteroids had a tendency to improve or maintain the pulmonary index, PEFR and oxygen saturation between normal values. In this study it was possible to identify a tendency in the patients who used corticosteroids: the hospitalizations and exacerbations were less. The extension of the study in terms of population sample offers a better statistical representation to determine the real tendency or conclusions.</dc:description>
