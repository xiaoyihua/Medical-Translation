<dc:description xml:lang="en">Vanishing white matter disease is a genetic disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance that affects the brain white matter There are various phenotypes that differ in severity and age at onset. Usually, it is characterized by ataxia, spasticity and a progressive motor decline with exacerbations triggered by fever and mild head traumas. The patient was a 2.5 year-old girl who developed unstable gait, left hemiparesis and increased tendon reflexes following a mild head trauma. Brain MRI showed diffuse and symmetric white matter abnormalities with decreased signal on T1 and increased signal on T2 and FLAIR sequences. Vanishing White Matter disease was suspected. The diagnosis was confirmed by genetic molecular testing that showed 2 mutations in EIF2B5 gene. Both mutations were considered pathogenic, although one had not been previously described. Hemiparesis must be included among clinical features of vanishing white matter disease. Early diagnosis can help to avoid infections and traumas and allows families to be genetically counselled. Our case contributes with the identification of a new mutation in EIF2B5 gene (p.Gly132Ala in position 395), not previously described. Its characteristics suggest a high probability of being pathogenic. We believe that it should be considered among the complex EIF2B mutations responsible for the disease.</dc:description>
