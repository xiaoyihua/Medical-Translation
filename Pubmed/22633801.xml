<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To compare mortality rates between immigrant and native-born residents of Andalusia between 2006 and 2010, and to characterize mortality by cause. MATERIAL AND METHODS The data consisted of deaths from mortality statistics by cause, and the aggregated populations registered in the lists of inhabitants by country of birth in the case of native-born individuals and immigrants (with immigrants grouped into six geographical areas of origin). Crude rates and age-standardized mortality rates (0-39, 40-65 and 65 years and above) were calculated by cause of death separately for men and women. RESULTS In the group aged 0-39 years, mortality due to external causes was higher in immigrants than in the native-born population, especially in African immigrants, with standardized rates of 142 and 145 deaths per 100,000 persons/year in women and men, respectively. Deaths due to maternal-related factors were particularly high among Africans. In the group aged 40-64 years, mortality rates were higher in immigrant women than in native-born women but were lower in immigrant men than in native-born men; in this age group, mortality was particularly high in African women and men from Europe and North America. In the group aged 65 years and over, mortality was higher in the native-born population of both genders than in immigrants due to cancer and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS The differences in mortality between immigrants and native-born residents varied depending on age, gender, cause of death and birthplace. Notable findings were the higher mortality among elderly native-born residents, due to chronic degenerative diseases, and the high mortality in the Sub-Saharan population at younger ages due to accidents.</dc:description>
