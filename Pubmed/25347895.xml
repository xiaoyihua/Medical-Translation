<dc:description xml:lang="en">Our aim was to explore and describe Argentine transplant nephrologists' perspectives on the renal transplant situation. Professionals (n = 22) in charge of teams and/or responsible for accepting grafts, donors, and transplant candidates, were specifically chosen. In-depth semistructured interviews were recorded, transcribed, analyzed and thematically coded. More than 50% of these professionals agreed on the need to promote organ donation. Almost half felt that dialysis centers did not refer their patients to transplant centers for their evaluation; as they should. Half of participants stated that the information provided by the allocation team was unreliable. Patients' non-compliance was identified as a major problem, mainly due to socio economic issues. Participants (n = 5/22) maintained that transplantation procedures were stagnant mainly due to low donor rates, poor training or lack of information at hand for nephrologists and transplant nephrologists. Participants alleged the need of further information, training and commitment of health professionals in the identity and referral of donors and transplant candidates. Also, it must be taken into account that socioeconomic difficulties affect the process at different stages. These issues need to be addressed in order to improve transplantation outcome where transparency and equality are concerned.</dc:description>
