<dc:description xml:lang="en">An informative descriptive study is conducted aimed at making nurses know about some essential aspects of suicide (characteristics, risk, indicators, methods for diagnosis and intervention) in order to increase the effectiveness of their role in the prevention of this health problem, having determined previously the information needs of these professionals. It is analyzed how useful it is the utilization of the nursing care process to approach those patients and families with suicide risk. The main signs of danger for suicidal behavior, as well as the essential risk factors and the most important methods to detect both indicators early are explained. Nurses are also instructed what to do with a patient with suicidal indicators and his family. It is concluded that a better training of these professionals will contribute to reduce the suicide impact on the community.</dc:description>
