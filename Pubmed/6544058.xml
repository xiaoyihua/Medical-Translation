<dc:description xml:lang="en">Minced fish flesh, both from Catfish (Arius sp) and from a mixture of various fish species of shrimp by-catch, were mixed with several starchy ingredients and salt. Drying at 70 degrees C was done until 4-10% moisture levels were reached. Physiochemical and microbiological tests (moisture, ash, protein, fat, pH, total volatile nitrogen, thiobarbituric tests, sodium chloride, color, total pour plate counts and yeast and mould counts) were conducted before and after drying. In addition, rehydration and sensory evaluation tests were performed in the dried products. Findings revealed that sodium chloride at 1.5% works as preservative and does not affect rehydration. Starchy ingredients favor fish particles binding and enhance sensory attributes such as color and appearance. Nevertheless, more studies in this area are recommended to reach acceptable quality products.</dc:description>
