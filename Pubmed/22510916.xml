<dc:description xml:lang="en">Alcohol use is one the most important risk factors for illness and early death in Peru. Measures aimed at decreasing or controlling the great impact caused by alcohol in the Peruvian society are urgently needed. This article identifies and promotes the implementation of public health measures supported by sound scientific evidence of effectiveness or, in some cases, cost-effectiveness. The 10 evidence-based public health measures identified and described here represent a set if measures with high probability of success if implemented, as they are supported by scientific evidence. We recommend that governments, at the national or local levels, apply these measures not individually, but in combination, arranging them into a plan or roadmap, where the framework in which they will be applied must be established according to each context. Considering the available resources, some of these measures could be implemented in the short and medium term while the others can be set in the long-term.</dc:description>
