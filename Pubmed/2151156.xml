<dc:description xml:lang="en">This article gives a general overview of present local health systems and their possible future. It reviews the background that led the countries of the Americas to make plans to transform their national health systems and points out the key role played by local health systems in this undertaking. In addition to summarizing the basic conditions necessary for setting up a local health system, the authors define these local systems as instruments for decentralization of the State and the expression of democratic action. They consider it an imperative for the 1990s to ensure that the services are improved in terms of equity and quality, democratization and social participation, economic and social development and transformation, and efficiency and use of appropriate technology. Stress is placed on the comprehensive concept of health, well-being, and development, as well as on health promotion by the population itself, while taking into account the responsibilities that correspond to national sector agencies and to local communities.</dc:description>
