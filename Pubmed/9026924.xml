<dc:description xml:lang="en">The histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis or Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a very rare entity in Spain. We present a 34-year-old arabic male admitted to hospital because one-month story of asthenia, anorexia, weight loss, fever and lymphadenopathies in all palpable sites. Analytic studies were all within normal limits except LDH levels and globular sedimentation rate, both raised. After cervical lymph node biopsy performance high grade Non-Hodgkin lymphoma was initially diagnosed. During admission he complained from pain in both shoulders and an erythematous desquamative eruption in trunk appeared. Some days later, a second lymph node biopsy was performed and Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease was diagnosed. Serologic tests for human herpes virus 6 were positive demonstrating active associated infection. He begun treatment with indomethicin, fever and general symptoms disappeared one week later discontinuing treatment. Two months after discharge, all lymphadenopathies had disappeared. A review on epidemiological, clinical, pathological and differential diagnosis issues is made.</dc:description>
