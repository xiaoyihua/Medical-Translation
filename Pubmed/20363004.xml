<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Knowing the differences in the effectiveness between three tumour necrosis factor alpha antagonists (anti-TNF alpha) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has important clinical implications. The aim of this study was to assess anti-TNF alpha effectiveness and to study possible differences in outcomes between them. PATIENTS AND METHOD We included all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) attended in consulting room from Zaragoza Area II between May 2000 and December 2006 who completed a year with anti-TNF alpha treatment. Several demographic and clinical parameters at the beginning and after a year with three different agents were analysed and compared. RESULTS 119 patients completed a year with anti-TNF alpha, 28 with infliximab, 44 with etanercept and 37 with adalimumab. After a year with treatment, DAS 28 descended 1,82 (1,42) points and HAQ 0,3 (0,58) (p&lt;0,05). Comparing the clinical parameters after a year DAS 28 was 3,8 in the three groups. HAQ was 1,2 for patients in treatment with infliximab and 0,9 for patients with etanercept and adalimumab. There were no significant differences in effectiveness between the 3 drugs. CONCLUSIONS Anti-TNF alpha drugs are effective to treat RA and the effectiveness is similar in all them.</dc:description>
