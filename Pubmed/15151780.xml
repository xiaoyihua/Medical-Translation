<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present a series of 4 patients in whom a ventricular septal defect (VSD) was closed with an Amplatzer muscular VSD device during cardiac catheterization. In one patient with type I truncus arteriosus and subarterial VSD, closure of a wide apical defect was done to allow further surgical correction while avoiding left ventricular ventriculotomy. The second patient had congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries with complete A-V block and a pacemaker implanted from birth. Our intention was unload the systemic anatomical right ventricle. The third patient had had 3 heart surgeries to correct a double outlet right ventricle. She had a residual ventricular septal defect which was large enough to cause heart failure. The last patient had an isolated muscular ventricular septal defect. Percutaneous closure was successful in all patients, and there were no complications. Percutaneous closure of the defect may be used as a primary procedure, before surgery, or as a complementary procedure after surgery.</dc:description>
