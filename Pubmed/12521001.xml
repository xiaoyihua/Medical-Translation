<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper demonstrate that plasmatic fibrinogen is a risk factor for ischaemic cardiovascular disease. Apart from its hemostatic functions, it has an important role in the atherothrombotic process. Prospective studies in a normal population and on patients with pre-existent cardiovascular disease demonstrate that fibrinogen is a predictor of cardiovascular events, either as first episode or recurrence. It is also reviewed a epidemiological study which is been carried out in Venezuela as a pilot study for Latinamerica because our population is different from those where the studies have been performed up to now. It is also mentioned the factors that influence the fibrinogen levels, some of them can be modified which could be useful for the prevention of the disease. It is considered the necessity of further studies to evaluate the benefit of the control of the fibrinogen level.</dc:description>
