<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED In spite of its high prevalence, asthma continues to be undertreated worldwide, and a physician's deficient knowledge seems to be the main reason. OBJECTIVES To measure the degree of physician's knowledge about classification and treatment of asthma exacerbations in children, and to identify physician's factors that might be involved. METHODS A prospective, observational, cross-sectional and analytical study was carried out. A 13 item questionnaire to evaluate the knowledge about asthma exacerbations was constructed and validated. This instrument was applied to clinicians working at emergency rooms in four secondary-level hospitals. RESULTS Forty doctors answered the questionnaire, with a median of 38.5% correct answers. Age, time-span working as specialist, years working at emergency rooms, number of courses attended, number of papers on asthma read, and number of asthma patients seen in a weekly basis did not influence the percentage of correct answers. Variables influencing the degree of knowledge were: being pediatrician (38.5% correct answers vs 23.1% in other specialties, p = 0.035) and working at night (50.0 vs 30.8% in other shift p = 0.031). A multiple lineal regression analysis corroborated the influence of these last two variables on the percentage of correct answers. CONCLUSIONS The questionnaire proved to be a useful tool that fulfilled expected goals. Percentage of correct answers was low among participating physicians, which indicated the need of educative intervention maneuvers to improve medical management of asthma exacerbation.</dc:description>
