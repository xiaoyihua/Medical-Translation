<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The cerebellum has traditionally been considered a neuronal system which is an essential part of coordination and motor control. However, in recent decades the idea of the cerebellum as an organ related to high level cognitive processes has gained strength, a claim supported by studies carried out on animals and humans with cerebellar lesions such as the contribution of modern neuroimaging techniques. DEVELOPMENT The contribution of the cerebellum is reviewed in different cognitive functions such as the regulation of motor functions, attention, language, visuoconstructional skills, learning, memory and executive functions. The results of said review produce, as the most clarifying data, the influence of the cerebellum on processes such as attention, working memory (covert articulation) and verbal fluency as well as procedural learning. The results found regarding the cerebellum and the executive functions are not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS We consider it necessary to systematize the table that has already been outlined. This will enable us to answer not only the question of whether the cerebellum plays a role in human cognition but which is its role. Perhaps the basis for understanding the cognitive functions of the cerebellum are not found in the fact that the cerebellum contains functions but that it relates the intention to the action in the emotional as well as the behavioural cognitive plane although the role of 'interface' is found closer to the output processes than processing of functions with a motor component.</dc:description>
