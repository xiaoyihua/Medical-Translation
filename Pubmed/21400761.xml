<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION L. Seebauer developed a radiologic classification of arthropathy due to massive rotator cuff tear, based on the medial and/or proximal displacement of the humeral head as a result of disease progression. The purpose of this paper is to conduct an evaluation of the concordance of such classification. METHODS A group of 34 patients with massive rotator cuff lesion was created. Their X-rays were reviewed and classified by 5 independent observers. An inter- and intraobserver concordance analysis was carried out using the Kappa index, and the results were interpreted according to the Landis and Kock criteria. RESULTS The intraobserver concordance determined for the 5 observers showed that the one with the greatest experience had an agreement close to 100%; the interobserver concordance found that only 2 of the 5 observers had moderate agreement and, finally, the interobserver concordance of the stages of classification 2A showed a substantial agreement, while a moderate agreement was found for IA and IB. DISCUSSION An important variability was found in the intraobserver concordance, where the capacity to reproduce the same results depends on the observer's experience. The results of the interobserver concordance show that the criteria established by Seebauer are insufficient to be reproduced. Finally, in the concordance among the stages a moderate agreement was found in each of the stages. CONCLUSION The results of this paper show that the Seebauer classification is experience-dependent, which hinders its routine use by orthopedists not sufficiently trained on shoulder surgery or by residents in training.</dc:description>
