<dc:description xml:lang="en">From 1950 to 1985, we have ascertained the causes of deaths caused by respiratory tract tumors of the: mouth, nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs and pleura. They have been grouped by sexes and divided among three decades (1950-1979) and a six-year period (1980-1985), Gross Rates (G.R.) and Standard Rates (S.R.) with relation to said parameters to plot their Death Rate Tendencies. An increasing death rate is observed in men as related to tumors of the bronchi and lungs, with a higher risk statistics which are quite significant from 1950 to 1985. On the other hand, there is a decrease in the deaths of both sexes due to neoplasias of the larynx. With regard to the oral tumors, there has been a minimum increase in the men over the last few years, the female death rate being practically nil. There are differences between men and women which are quite significant statistically with regard to death rates related to tumors of the mouth, larynx, Bronchi and lungs. Nevertheless, given the method for collecting data, it can only be used as a guide, due to the turns affecting the sources of information.</dc:description>
