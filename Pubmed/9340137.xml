<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Aphasia in bilingual persons has some striking peculiarities. Most studies have been carried out in mono-lingual societies, where the second language has usually been learnt after immigration. In Galicia, linguistic closeness and simultaneous learning of Galician and Castilian languages permits the testing of neuropsychological theories conceived in other circumstances. OBJECTIVE In aphasic bilingual Galician-Castilian patients we studied how this affected denomination, designation and translation, different modes of recovery, variables associated with differential affectation, the presence and influence of specific phenomena of aphasia in bilingual persons on changes in dominance and mixing of the languages. Material and methods. We selected 49 patients, 29 men and 20 women aged between 32 and 85 years old. We analyzed the variables associated with differential affectation: types of aphasia, size and site of the lesion, aetiology, age, educational level, and the presence and influence of phenomena specific to aphasia in bilingual persons. RESULTS The test most affected was translation, to a lesser extent denomination, and finally designation. Capacity for recovery is greater in the dominant language. Translation recovers better than denomination and this better than designation. We found no changes in dominance, no selective loss of either language but have seen some interference in the non-dominant language. CONCLUSIONS The two languages are seen to be recovered equally, as were other languages previously studied in aphasiology.</dc:description>
