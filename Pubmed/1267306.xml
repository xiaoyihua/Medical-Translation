<dc:description xml:lang="en">Seventeen cases of Guillain-Barré's syndrome aged between 14 month ans 7 years are studied from clinical, analytical and evolutives aspects. Neither sex nor season predominance occurs. Sixteen of the patients had a previous viral or bacterial infection. Difficulty in walking was the main symptom at the onset of illness. Arreflexia and motot paralysis were always symmetrical and ascending. Albumino-cytological dissociation in the C.S.F. was found in the whole group. An evolutive study was made of the recovery of movement, C.S.F. and tendon reflexes which occurred in this order except in two cases which showed abnormal evolution. We emphasize the extent and frequency of respiratory difficulties at the onset of illness. Some etiopathogenic aspects, the lack of specifity of the syndrome and the differences of the diagnosis with that of poliomyelitis are commented. We point out the lack of effect of the corticosteroids treatment and the positive effects of phisiotherapy after the acute stage.</dc:description>
