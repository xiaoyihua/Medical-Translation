<dc:description xml:lang="en">The history of the philosophy has witnessed a controversy between those who maintain that the human being is born with inherited knowledge and those who assert that the mind of man is like a "tabula rasa", a tablet on which nothing has been written. Recent experiments have shown that the last group was wrong. The human being is born endowed with certain types of knowledge which were already present in those animals which preceded us in the evolution. The fear of snakes, the number sense and the recognition of familiar faces are three typical examples among others.</dc:description>
