<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of asthma-related symptoms in the Guadalajara Health Area, using the methods prescribed by the first phase of the European Asthma Study (EAS). A transversal descriptive study by self-administered questionnaire in a population of 2,968 subjects aged 20 to 44 years old assigned to the Guadalajara Health Area was performed. The study took place between September 1995 and February 1996. We received 2,435 responses (81.2% of the sample). Each symptom was studied in relation to sex, age, domicile and smoking and the results were compared to data from other Spanish health areas participating in the EAS. Significant differences were found between our results and those of other Spanish health areas. Subjects reporting asthma symptoms accounted for 8.6% (C.I. 7.5% to 9.8%) of the sample. Presence of asthma was related to place of residence but not to age or sex.</dc:description>
