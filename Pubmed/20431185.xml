<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Concomitantly with the actual trend towards later fathering, more detailed studies are necessary to establish the relationship between male age and seminal features. The objective of the present paper was to evaluate the relationship of men age with semen quality and with the seminal levels of epididymal and accessory gland markers. METHODS The study was conducted as a retrospective study of 9168 cases obtained from the Andrology and Reproduction Laboratory in Cordoba, Argentina for 10 years (1995-2004) (men ages 20 to 77). An important number of factors such as abstinence time, toxic habits, work conditions and drugs consumption has been statistically considered. The parameters measured were: seminal volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, sperm motility, morphology and viability. Seminal levels of alpha-glucosidase, fructose and citric acid were also evaluated. RESULTS We detected a significant decrease in seminal volume, sperm count, motility, viability and normal morphology, and a reduction in alpha-glucosidase and fructose levels in relation to age. CONCLUSIONS Since semen quality is a tool for fertility prognosis estimation, the weight of evidence indicates that men may become progressively less fertile as they get older. Couples who decide to delay childbearing should be warned about this matter.</dc:description>
