<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this study was to ascertain the social and demographical characteristics of disability in Latin America and verify the methodology used in the survey by questionnaires for the analysis of disabilities. It is a descriptive study that analyzed the data and methodology of disability surveys conducted in Latin America after 2001. It was noted that there is a big difference in the prevalence of disability found in the surveys that used the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) for statistical analysis of people with disabilities. It was also shown that in Latin America motor disabilities are more prevalent in men over 65 years old and with a low educational level. The main cause is chronic disease. The conclusion is that ICF is a good methodological tool to use in disability survey questionnaires.</dc:description>
