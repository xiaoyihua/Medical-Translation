<dc:description xml:lang="en">MATERIAL AND METHODS 600 subjects were studied, chosen at random, between 1 and 55 years old, 300 asthmatic and the rest apparently healthy. RESULTS Of 300 asthmatic patients, the average concentration of eosinophils in peripheral blood was of 615.93/mm3 (p = 0.000004, R = 2.13), the asthmatic patients with levels of eosinophils over a 400/mm3 presented: more severe asthma per month and made use of hospital services more often, (p = 0.00001, R = 3.56). In 195 patients were detected eosinophils in nasal mucus with an average concentration of 10.54% (p = 0.04, R = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS The incidence and prevalence of asthma seem favored by the lact of predictive sensors. In the study, the blood and nasal eosinophils, in high levels were identified in subjects at high risk, consequently its use is proposed to diagnose and follow up, with the goal of applying measures in the balanced phase of the health-illness chain.</dc:description>
