<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To describe the rationale, pros and cons, and complications of the anterior-lateral extrapleural retroperitoneal approach for unstable (TLICS&gt;4) thoracolumbar fractures. PATIENTS AND METHODS Clinical and radiological data and outcomes from a cohort treated surgically via said approach were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were operated on exclusively by 5 neurosurgeons trained in spine surgery. RESULTS Between June 1999 and December 2015, 86 patients underwent surgery (median age 42years, most common level: L1). Approximately 32.5% presented with a preoperative neurological defect. After surgery (mean duration: 275minutes), 75.6% presented with no neurological sequelae and only one-third required blood transfusion. Median postoperative stay was 7days. Correction of kyphosis was considered adequate and suboptimal but acceptable in 91% and 9% of the patients, respectively. Complications occurred in 36 patients, the majority being transient. We observed failure of the construct in 2 cases (collapse of an expandable cage and extrusion of a locking screw). No infections, vascular or visceral lesions, permanent neurological worsening or mortality occurred during hospitalisation. One patient ultimately needed additional posterior fixation due to persistence of pain. Median follow-up was 252days (27.9% was lost to follow-up). CONCLUSIONS The extrapleural extraperitoneal approach provides solid anterior reconstruction, allows wide decompression of the spinal canal, and permits adequate and long-lasting correction of kyphosis. The rates of infection, construct failure, need for reoperation and vascular or visceral lesions are minimal.</dc:description>
