<dc:description xml:lang="en">Although it seems that the issue of law and bioethics has been much debated today, still raising doubts and conflicts among the nursing staff on what their regulation must relationship between law and bioethics, or that we should know about informed consent and advance directive, if the Jehovah's Witnesses can refuse the treatments, and how these decisions affect the person and how it relates to the principle of autonomy, which are covered by a legal framework that gives greater freedom and autonomy to the patient's decision. The Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian community descended from a group of scholars, who base their beliefs on a particular interpretation of the Bible and that, in Spain, like other denominations, are registered in the Registry of Religious Entities of the Directorate General of Religious Affairs of the Ministry of Justice. Therefore, this paper intends to analyze through a literature review the ethical and legal concepts within the existing legal framework, and how the decisions made by people, even still risking their life, must be accepted andprotected by a legalremedy, without prejudice to the exceptions provided by law.</dc:description>
