<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To provide a review of the literature regarding the pathological effects of material used in clinical dentistry. DATA SOURCES PubMed search was performed using the key words: dental biomaterial, odontologic toxicity, odontologic allergy, dental allergens, dental resins. STUDY SELECTION Articles were selected based on their relevance to this topic. RESULTS The biomaterials used in orthodontic or dental treatment may lead to alterations of greater biological importance in susceptible or sensitized individuals, and may be able to alter the functions of cells in the mouth, including dentinogenesis and tissue repair; toxicity and mutagenicity have been observed. Some of them release potential antigens or allergens capable of inducing immune or immediate and delayed allergic reactions of diverse severity and extension, which may include extraoral damage. CONCLUSIONS The number of patients with pathology originated by dental materials has increased. The scarce knowledge about it delays diagnosis. The study of biomaterials used in odontologic procedures and its harmful effect must be encouraged, as well as its pathological manifestations which require more clinical investigation and diffusion, with the aim to give more and better information to dentists, family and allergy physicians so that they can provide prompt and successful care.</dc:description>
