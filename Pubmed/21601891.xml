<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess the population-based incidence trends of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC): squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). PATIENTS AND METHOD From January 1994 to December 2007, 9,247 patients diagnosed with NMSC were recruited in the population-based Cancer Registry of Girona. Incidence rates were calculated with age-adjusted according to the Word standard population (WASR) by a direct method and reported as number of new cases per 100,000 person-year. To evaluate incidence trends by age group we used specific rates for these groups (45-64, &gt; 64 years). We excluded patients younger than 45 years. Joinpoint method was used to estimate the average annual percentage change (AAPC) for the whole study period according to histologic and age groups. RESULTS Age-adjusted incidence was 55.74 per 10(5) person-year; it was higher in males (67.13) than in females (46.9). Age-adjusted incidence for BCC was higher compared with the incidence for SCC (44.56 and 11.18 respectively). Age-adjusted incidence rate for NMSC for both sexes increased from 48.53 (1994-95) to 60.54 (2004-05) with an AAPC of 2.30%, which was higher in females (2.65%) than in males (1.99%). CONCLUSIONS There has been a significant increase in the incidence of NMSC in our area, particularly evident for SCC, and it is more important in patients older than 64 years and in females.</dc:description>
