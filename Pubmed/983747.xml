<dc:description xml:lang="en">This is a succint description of the International Pilot Study on Schizophrenia, sponsored by the World Health Organization and conducted in field research centers located in 9 different countries. The main objective of this study was the development of standard procedures for case finding, assessment of damage caused by Schizophrenia and observation of the course and outcome of the disorder. Starting in 1968, groups of approximately 120 patients who met the criteria both for inclusion and exclusion were studied in each center. They were subject to study by means of several instruments and were given a clinical diagnosis. On that basis, comparative analysis within and between centers were conducted, as well as reliability tests for the procedures used. Two follow-ups took place at 2 and 5 year intervals in order to obtain information about the course and outcome of cases. The emphasis of this presentation is placed on the findings at the Cali (Colombia) field reserach center and their comparison with the global results of centers in the rest of the world. In that context, the findings show that centers in developping countries are at least as capable for conducting research work as those in the developped countries. There is also the suggestion that mental disorders in developping countries apparently tend to more benign course and outcome.</dc:description>
