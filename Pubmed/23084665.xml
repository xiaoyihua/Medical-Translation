<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Hospital professionals are an opinion group that influences the general population. OBJECTIVE To analyze attitudes to living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) among non-medical professionals working in Spanish and Latin American hospitals and to determine the variables that influence these attitudes. MATERIAL AND METHOD A random sample, stratified by department, was selected from non-medical staff in the "International Donor Collaborative Project": there were three hospitals in Spain, five in Mexico and two in Cuba. Attitudes were evaluated through a validated, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS There were 951 non-medical professionals: 277 from Spain, 632 from Mexico and 42 from Cuba. A total of 86% (n = 818) were in favor of related living donation and 31% (n = 299) were in favor of unrelated living donation. This attitude was associated with the following: country (Mexico 88%, Cuba 83%, Spain 81%) (p =0.016), female sex (p =0.026), having experience of donation and transplantation (p =0.001), having a favorable attitude to donation (P &lt;0.001), considering the possibility of needing a transplant (P &lt;0.001), being in favor of living kidney donation (P &lt;0.001), being willing to accept a transplant from a living donor if necessary (P &lt;0.001), discussing donation and transplantation with the family and partner (P &lt;0.001), carrying out pro-social activities (P &lt;0.001), believing that one's religion was in favor of donation and transplantation (P&lt;0.001), and not worrying about bodily mutilation after donation (P &lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS Attitudes toward related LDLT among non-medical staff in various Spanish, Mexican and Cuban hospitals are favorable. In 86% of those surveyed, this attitude was not influenced by classical psychosocial factors.</dc:description>
