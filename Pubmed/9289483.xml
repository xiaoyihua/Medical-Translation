<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of safety-belt use in a telephone survey and an observational survey. PATIENTS AND METHODS Observational survey. Trained interviewers studied 4,067 front-seat occupants, at ten intersections of Madrid, according to "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration" guidelines. TELEPHONE SURVEY: We selected 433 front seat occupants from the Madrid city residential telephone directory. The questionnaire was completed by trained interviewers. RESULTS Prevalence by the observational survey was 58.5%, and was significantly higher at interurban intersections (OR = 2.1) than city intersections. In the telephone survey, the overall prevalence was 94% at interurban area and 64% at city area and it was associated with no history of lines and positive opinion of effectiveness of safety belts. CONCLUSIONS The safety belt prevalence observed is low, especially in the urban area. The telephone survey overestimates the safety belt use, but contributes with useful information for planning strategies.</dc:description>
