<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To evaluate retrospectively the comorbidity of mental and addictive disorders in community mental health and substance misuse services in Madrid. METHODS The medical records of 400 patients from mental health and substance misuse services in Madrid were evaluated. Records were examined for the last 20 patients from each service unit. RESULTS Dual pathology was constituted when a current diagnosis of mental and addictive disorders, excluding nicotine addiction, appeared on the patient's records. Prevalence of dual pathology was 34%. There were differences in the prevalence figures for the two kinds of service: 36.78% in substance misuse services, and 28.78% in mental health services. There was an association of dual diagnosis with alcohol or cocaine dependence, but not with opioid dependence. The mental disorders more prevalent in dually diagnosed than in non-dually diagnosed patients were mood disorders, personality disorders, and schizophrenia. CONCLUSION There is a high prevalence of dual pathology in those seeking treatment, being higher in substance misuse services than in mental health services, and higher in patients with alcohol or cocaine dependence. These findings could be of help in the planning of care resource policies for these patients.</dc:description>
