<dc:description xml:lang="en">We studied 89 patients diagnosed in our emergency department of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, to describe the efficacy and safety of intravenous adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in their treatment. All received a first bolus of 10 mg of ATP and if no electrical response was observed, a second dose of 20 mg. This treatment was successful in 91% of the patients, lasting of 26.9 seconds to resolve the episode, and in the 53% of the patients with the first dose. In 9% of the patients ATP did not resolve the episode but allowed to diagnose it, which in five patients was atrial flutter, in 2 Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and in one atrial fibrillation. Adverse effects appeared in 25.6% of the cases, being in all transitory and banal. ATP is a very effective and safe drug for the treatment of patients with PSVT.</dc:description>
