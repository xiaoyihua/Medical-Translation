<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To briefly describe the life and works of D.F.J.B. Trehet, a physician of the city of Rouen (France), who was the first to describe the "osseous points" in a renal calculus. Trèhet has not been recognized or referenced for this original observation in the urological publications. METHODS Trehet lived in the period of the Enlightenment and endured the upheavals of the French Revolution. Data gleaned from several sources have permitted and elaborate description of this French physician from both the social and professional perspectives. RESULTS After completing his studies at the Hôtel Dieu in Rouen, D.F.J.B. Trehet pursued his education at the School of Health in Paris. He read his doctorate's thesis at the Paris School of Medicine in 1803 and published his observation of a renal calculus "with osseous points" in 1812. Other studies by D.F.J.B. Trehet were also published in Le Journal de Médecine, Chirurgie et Pharmacie. CONCLUSIONS D.F.J.B. Trehet should be recognized as the first to describe an osseous renal calculus.</dc:description>
