<dc:description xml:lang="en">Abdominal symptoms frequently affect patients with AIDS. Acute abdominal pain is a diagnostic challenge that may require elective or urgent surgical treatment, although information about the latter is scarce. In this study we analyzed the clinical findings and follow-up of acute abdominal pain complicating patients with AIDS. In a two-year period, we collected several variables from patients with AIDS and acute abdominal pain: demographic, laboratory, clinical symptoms, initial diagnosis, surgical findings, post-surgical and histopathological diagnosis and post-surgical complications. From 232 hospitalized patients, 34 had acute abdominal pain: 32 male and 2 women (median age = 32 years; range 26 to 58 years). Twenty-two patients required surgical treatment. Eight patients had a post-surgical complication; in five of them, six surgical re-interventions were performed. Three deaths occurred in the 30-day period after surgery. Survival for patients conservatively treated was 4 months (1 to 17 months), vs. 6.5 months (1 to 20 months) in the surgically treated group. Physicians should be aware about the several diagnostic possibilities of acute abdominal pain complicating patients with AIDS. Delay of surgery in these patients may be lethal. Surgery has an important role in the integral treatment of patients with AIDS.</dc:description>
