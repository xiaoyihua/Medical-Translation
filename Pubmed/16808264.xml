<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Spain is the world leader in organ transplant rates, and the national average is maintained in the northwestern Spanish region of Galicia. However, there is no official registry recording transplantation results in this region. In this paper we report a study of patient and graft survival and risk factors among kidney transplant patients in Galicia between January 1996 and December 2000. METHODS Patients receiving kidney transplants in Galicia in the above period were monitored up to the end of 2001, deaths and graft losses were recorded and analysed by actuarial and Kaplan-Meier methods, and possible risk factors for death and graft loss were evaluated using Cox's proportional hazards model. RESULTS In the study period, 672 kidneys were transplanted, all from deceased donors. Graft and patient survival rates were respectively 80% and 94% after 1 year, and 67% and 83%, after 5 years. Two-thirds of graft losses occurred within the first year and the most common cause was vascular thrombosis (44%). Independent risk factors for graft loss were donor asystole (relative risk [RR] = 3.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.73-6.73), donor age (RR = 1.54, CI: 1.05-2.27 for 40-60-year-olds, RR = 2.59, CI: 1.66-4.07 for over-60s, relative to under-40s), donation from outside the institution in which implant was performed (RR = 1.43, CI: 1.02-2.02), acute rejection (RR = 2.32, CI: 1.63-3.22), and retransplantation (RR = 1.56, CI: 1.03-2.37). The main causes of death were infections (38%), followed by cardiovascular pathologies (30%) and tumours (11%). CONCLUSIONS The kidney transplant rate varies excessively within Galicia; the global rate is 50 per million inhabitants per year. Patient survival is similar to those recorded in national registers, but graft survival is deficient, apparently due to a high incidence of vascular thrombosis.</dc:description>
