<dc:description xml:lang="en">In December 1988-February 1989 period, a survey on enteroparasitic infections in children (mean age 8.7 years; males 54.4% and females 45.6%) from five schools located in Santiago, Chile, was undertaken. To each of these individuals, three samples were obtained in order to perform in them the following examinations: co-proparasitological study, modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining for detecting Cryptosporidium sp. and cellulose adhesive test for Enterobius vermicularis. Parasitic elements were found in the following percentages: Blastocystis hominis 51.8, Enterobius vermicularis 39.9, Giardia lamblia 32.1, Entamoeba histolytica 7.8, Hymenolepis nana 2.1 and Ascaris lumbricoides 0.4, Cryptosporidium sp. were not observed. The present study would be demonstrating that enteroparasites maintain their endemic condition among school children from Santiago, including B. hominis which had not been searched previously.</dc:description>
