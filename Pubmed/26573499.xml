METHODOLOGY Review of 276 medical records of patients who had undergone ECTAR between 1997 and 2007 at the Clínica Universitaria Bolivariana de Medellín, Colombia. Data was collected through an instrument designed for that purpose and then was analyzed. RESULTS During 10 years, more than 2000 ECT procedures were performed; most of the patients were female 67.4%, between 15 and 86 years old. The first indication was a major depressive episode without psychotic symptoms (56.5%) almost half of the patients had a minor and temporary complication, and no major complications or deaths were reported.
