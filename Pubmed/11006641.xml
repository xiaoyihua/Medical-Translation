<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Non immune hydrops is an uncommon entity, it is observed in one per 2,000 to 3,500 alive birth. It can be idiopathic or secondary to different pathologies, the most important examples are: congenital malformations, cromosompathies or viral infections. OBJECTIVE To show our therapeutic and diagnostic experience in two cases of non immune hydrops. STUDY DESIGN To present a case of spontaneous reversion of non immune hydrops secondary to parvovirus B 19 infection and other case secondary to congenital cardiopathy. RESULTS We found spontaneous reversion of a case of non immune hydrops due to a parvovirus B 19 infection and infant was normal but the infant with congenital cardiopathy died ten minutes after birth. CONCLUSIONS Two of the most important causes of non immune hydrops are cardiopathies and infections, specially parvovirus which is responsible of poor perinatal outcome but there is a remote possibility of spontaneous reversion because it is important to make a specific diagnose and to make the expected management.</dc:description>
