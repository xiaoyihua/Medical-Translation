<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this study was to correlate soybean dust (SD) exposure, skin reactivity to soybean hull (SH) allergens, and symptoms of asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. A group of 365 subjects with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis and a control group of 50 individuals without respiratory symptoms were studied. The level of exposure to SD is defined as follows: 1) direct (DE); 2) indirect (ID), and 3) urban (UE). All subjects completed standard questionnaires. Skin tests with a SH extract and with common allergens were performed by the prick technique (SPT). Fifty-six (15.3%) patients and no subjects from control group had positive SPT (histamine index &gt; or = 0.5) with a SH allergen extract. The percentages of positive SPT to SH extract were 38.7%, 20.3% and 8.4% in subjects with DE, IE and UE, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Monosensitization to SH was absent in all subjects. The percent of subjects with positive SPTs to mites (p &lt; 0.01), pollen (p &lt; 0.01) and molds (p &lt; 0.05) were higher in subjects with a positive SPT to SH versus those with a negative SPT to SH. Sixty-six percent of subjects with DE and 13.6% of subjects with IE or UE reported respiratory symptoms after SD inhalation (Odds Ratio: 12.67 [2.4-74.9], p &lt; 0.001). Compared to subjects exclusively sensitized to mites, patients sensitized to SH presented significantly different clinical characteristics. Soybean production has been increasing in Argentina during the last 20 years, determining an increase in the population exposed to chronic SD inhalation. This fact determines a high risk of sensitization and triggering of respiratory symptoms in atopic subjects. This study demonstrates that there is: 1) a high prevalence of skin reactivity to SH in subjects with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis from Argentina and that this prevalence is associated with the level of exposure to SD, and 2) an association between sensitivity to SH and severity of asthma. Measures to avoid release and inhalation of SD in rural areas from Argentina are needed.</dc:description>
