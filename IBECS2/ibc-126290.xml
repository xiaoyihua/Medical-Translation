<dc:description xml:lang="es">Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a fluorinated compound considered such as a persistent organic pollutant, which presents neurotoxicity. This chemical crosses the blood brain barrier and it is able to increase their own transportation through this structure, reaching the central nervous system, where it can induce toxicity. This work was undertaken to evaluate the possible effects of PFOS exposure in the corpus striatum at both neurochemical and histological levels. Adult male rats were orally treated with 0.5, 1, 3 and 6 mg of PFOS/Kg/day for 28 days. At the end of this treatment, the concentration of the main neurotransmitters amino acids has been determined in striatum and the possible morphological alterations have been studied in this same brain region. Animals treated with PFOS show an increase of glutamine concentration and a decrease of glutamate and aspartate content. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and taurine concentration decreases with the dose of 1 mg/Kg/day, increasing with the dose of 3 mg/Kg/day. PFOS also induces a cellular dose-dependent degeneration. Furthermore, PFOS exposure at high doses (3 and 6 mg/kg/day) induces satellitosis in striatatal cells. These neurochemical and morphological alterations observed in adult male rat trated with PFOS could be related to cognitive and emotional dysfunctions as well as to several neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson's disease (AU)</dc:description>
