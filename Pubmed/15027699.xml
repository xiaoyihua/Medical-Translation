<dc:description xml:lang="en">The main characteristics of the genome of the virus of the hepatitis C is studied, especially those such parts as the IRES for its capacity of union to the ribosome of the cell, the HVR1 for its high capacity of viral replication, as well as the place of union to the PKR or the ISDR, inside the protein NS5. They are defined the genotype concepts, subtype and quasispecies, and their implications in different such aspects as: 1) pathogenicity (in the severity of the infectious process, in the extrahepatic manifestations and in the appearance of the hepatocarcinoma); 2) in the biggest or smaller sensibility in the diagnostic techniques; 3) in the resistance to the treatment with interferon (well through the road NS3 or NS5, so much through the changes in PKR or the mutations in ISDR), and 4) in the epidemiology (changes of geographical variability, use of that variability like epidemic marker and obtaining difficulty of vaccines).</dc:description>
