<dc:description xml:lang="en">A sensible and rational approach is necessary in order to match the growing requirements of information on the ambulatory care sector characterised by a big deal of complexity and variability. This must be applied to any initiative attempting to obtain any degree of harmonization in ambulatory care data sets. This paper summarises a conceptual aspect of the work undertaken by the project Measurement Characterization and Control of Ambulatory Care in Europe (McACE) sponsored by the Commission of the European Communities under the exploratory phase of the Advanced Informatics in Medicine (AIM) programme. Our approach places in the first priority the efficiency when assessing the information needs of the different actors trying to make a balanced approach between the costs of collecting and processing a specific item and its use. For this we performed a conceptual validation of the term Minimum Basic Data Set and its potential application to the Ambulatory Care Sector. It is suggested its substitution by the term Minimum Data Set as a part of a practical tool for promoting the harmonization of the information in ambulatory care.</dc:description>
