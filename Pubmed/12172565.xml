<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the infectious diseases whose elimination or eradication is possible. However, it is still a serious problem among health workers who are an important risk group to acquire this infection. OBJECTIVE To focus the problem of the HBV infection among health workers in terms of the risks and prevention alternatives, showing effective strategies to this effect. DATA SOURCE Analysis of related publications through the MEDLINE system and the review of scientific journals, both in English and Spanish. SYNTHESIS OF INFORMATION: An available and effective vaccine against HBV exist more than 10 years ago. Some national hospitals have demonstrated the prevalence of HBV infection in apparently healthy staff, which evidences that it is an occupational problem. The vaccination of this risk group has proved to reduce the HBV infection in several centers in different countries, in addition to the cost-effectiveness of this measure. CONCLUSION HBV infection constitutes a significant problem in our country considering its intermediate high endemic rate. No effective measures for its control have been taken, despite the availability of effective vaccines and strategies for the control and prevention of this disease, not to mention their economic benefits.</dc:description>
