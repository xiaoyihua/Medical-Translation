<dc:description xml:lang="en">Overweight derived from the intake of new antipsychotic medication in order to treat schizophrenia is a growing problem. The main purpose of this study is to launch a cognitive behavioural program in outpatients. It is focused on the weight control of patients with chronic mental diseases, especially those diagnosed as psychotic, and who are under treatment in a Psychosocial Rehabilitation Centre. In this study, the results of an experimental group and a control group were compared. The experimental group was made up of 7 individuals, 3 males and 4 females, and the control group comprised 4 males and 4 females. The program had a duration of twelve sessions administered over a period of three months. Three months after concluding the program, both groups were followed up. The data obtained indicate the efficiency of the cognitive-behavioural treatment in the patients. The achievements of this project were, on the one hand, to significantly reduce the patients' weight and, on the other, to modify their nutritional and physical exercise habits.</dc:description>
