<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To define the CT findings for bronchial carcinoid tumors and to determine whether these findings enable these tumors to be classified as typical or atypical. MATERIAL AND METHODS We reviewed the chest CT studies performed between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2009 in patients at our hospital diagnosed with bronchial carcinoid tumors. The sample consisted of 52 patients (23 women and 29 men) with a mean age of 47 years (range 11-77 years). The 52 cases were classified as typical or atypical on the basis of the following radiological findings: size, location, focality, type of growth, calcifications, signs secondary to bronchial obstruction, and the presence of significant lymph node enlargement or metastases. These findings were then compared with the histological findings. RESULTS Typical carcinoid tumors were the most prevalent (46 cases). The variables associated with atypical tumors were: male sex, advanced age at onset, and size &gt;3cm. The accuracy of CT in classifying atypical tumors correctly increased with the number of variables indicative of atypical carcinoid tumors. A negative result for atypical nature made it possible to rule out an atypical carcinoid tumor in 95% of the cases. CONCLUSION CT is useful for defining and characterizing carcinoid tumors into typical or atypical, although a precise formula for differentiating between the two types remains to be defined.</dc:description>
