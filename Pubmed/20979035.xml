<dc:description xml:lang="en">As the average human lifespan is increasing worldwide, ischemic stroke became one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity, particularly in emerging countries. Significant decrease in the rates of first and recurrent stroke using statins has been established in large clinical trials and in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Interestingly, observational studies reported that cholesterol levels were only weakly associated with ischemic stroke, suggesting that other potential mechanisms for vascular protection should be implicated. Indeed, beyond lipid changes, some properties of these drugs, related to inflammation, hemostasis, endothelial function, plaque stabilization, and more recently, to the mobilization of endothelial cells, have been proposed. In addition, recent meta-analysis also revealed that statins decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Taken together, all these benefits can contribute for stroke prevention by statins.</dc:description>
