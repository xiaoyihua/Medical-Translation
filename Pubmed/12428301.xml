<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of the present study has been to determine, in a population group over 80 years of age in a publicly-funded geriatric institution, the anthropometric parameters that represent reference values for the study of nutritional status. These parameters allow detection of alterations in the nutritional status which, once corrected, will contribute to maintaining an appropriate quality of life in a population group that is highly sensitive to the associated morbidity and mortality processes. In order to carry out this study, a sample of 56 healthy elderly individuals was selected (13 men and 43 women) with a mean age of 86.5 +/- 4.8 years and a range from 80 to 101 years. The parameters measured were: weight, height, tricipital fold, brachial perimeter and the following values calculated on the basis of these figures: body mass index, percentage of body fat, brachial muscular area, brachial muscular perimeter, brachial adipose area and the ratio of muscle to adipose tissue. These values were processed statistically with the assistance of the RSB-SIGMA computer software, with calculation of the percentiles, the mean, and the comparison between the sexes. The criterion for statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Our results confirm the presence of significant differences in the muscle parameters, which are greater in men than in women, whereas the fat parameters are higher in the latter. Thus, it is concluded that weight, height, brachial muscle area and brachial muscle perimeter are significantly higher in men whereas tricipital fold, percentage of body fat, the brachial adipose area and the muscle to adipose tissue ratio are significantly superior among women. There are no significant differences by gender in the body mass index and the brachial perimeter.</dc:description>
