<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE In this article we review the disorders of development which affect learning and may be associated with dyslexia. DEVELOPMENT Although the cognitive basis of dyslexia is a phonological deficit, it is not uncommonly associated with other disorders whose deficit is not necessarily related to the dyslexia from a physiopathological point of view. The problems which usually accompany dyslexia are: attention deficit with hyperactivity, dysgraphia, dyscalculia and disorders of the development of coordination. The starting point for understanding this comorbidity is finding broad, dysfunctional areas of the brains of dyslexic patients beyond those theoretically involved in dyslexia. Each of these disorders may or may not occur together with dyslexia. There are even some subtypes which are defined by being associated with dyslexia, leading to the conclusion that in some cases there are underlying common mechanisms. It is necessary to avoid confusion arising over dyslexia due to comorbidity with other conditions.</dc:description>
