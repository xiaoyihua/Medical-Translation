<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Sickle cell anemia is a structural hemoglobinopathy in which morphological and physical changes in erythrocytes cause vaso-occlusive episodes in various organs and tissues. The disease is common among blacks and the African population. As a result of the growing migratory flow, this is an emerging disease in Spain. OBJECTIVE To present the casuistics of a pediatric hospital: clinical onset, the most frequent features and complications, and treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a retrospective study of 22 patients aged less than 18 years old diagnosed with sickle cell anemia between January 1985 and December 2001. Epidemiologic data, symptoms, complications, blood test results, treatment, and response were recorded. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 39 months. In 54 %, diagnosis was established before the age of 2 years. No differences were found in sex. The countries of origin were Gambia in 32 %, Morocco in 23 %, and Senegal in 18 % as well as other African and Central America countries; 53 % of the children were born in Spain. The most common complaint was vaso-occlusive pain localized in the abdomen (45 %). The most frequent complications were infections and 13.7 % suffered stroke. Twenty-eight percent of the patients diagnosed before the age of 2 years presented complications. Eleven patients received hydroxyurea for recurrent vaso-occlusive crises with favorable results; one patient underwent splenectomy and another received an allogenic bone marrow transplant from an HLA-identical brother with excellent results. CONCLUSIONS This study reproduces the data described in the literature from countries with a high prevalence of the disease. Morbidity could be minimized by early diagnosis and preventive treatment and good healthcare. Given the increasing incidence of the disease, screening of black and African neonates and genetic counseling are recommended together with guidelines for prompt and appropriate treatment in primary health centers and emergency departments.</dc:description>
