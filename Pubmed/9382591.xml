<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The present study analyzed occupational rehabilitation following renal transplantation and its impact on social costs. METHODS/RESULTS A survey was conducted on 493 patients who had undergone renal transplantation during 1979 to 1995. The results show that 27.76% were working after kidney transplantation versus 27.52% during dialysis. Retirement was the most common explanation given for not working (29.4%) when the percentage of those over age 65 accounted for 8%. CONCLUSION Analysis of the occupational status in relation with sex, age, level of education, profession and type of dialysis disclosed that women aged 25-34 years, with a high level of education, who describe themselves as entrepreneurs and have had peritoneal dialysis, have a higher likelihood of working after transplantation.</dc:description>
