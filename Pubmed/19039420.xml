<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To establish the prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome and other factors of cardiovascular risk in a population of masculine workers of the operative area of the plant of vinyl poly chloride of a petrochemical complex, in the occident of Venezuela. METHOD An analytical cross sectional study was performed in 84 workers, they was determined size, weight, arterial pressure, abdominal circumference, body mass index, smoke, alcoholic habits and medicaments consumption. Additionally, 10 ml fasting venous blood sample was taken to determine glycemia, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C and VLDL-C. The diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome was carried out under the approaches of NCEP/ATP III criteria's. RESULTS The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was of 27 cases (32 ,1 %), 21 cases (77,7 %) in ages among 26-40 years. The alcohol consumption (91 ,6 %), LDL-C (64,3 %), high systolic arterial pressure (59,5 %), obesity (56,6 %) and high triglycerides (55,9 %) were the principal's cardiovascular factors risk detected. The biochemical parameters were significantly higher in the men with clinical diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in comparison with those that didn't present the syndrome (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION To weigh that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was not so high, the factors of cardiovascular risk in an individual way were high, considering that the hard-working population is young is necessary to implement programs of prevention and changes of lifestyles to minimize the risk of coronary illness and vascular brain that lead to labour s disability.</dc:description>
