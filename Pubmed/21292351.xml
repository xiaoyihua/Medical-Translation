<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The aim of this work is to present a historical review of urological pharmacotherapy. The containers used to preserve and store medicines are an important source of information in historical research. MATERIAL AND METHODS I studied written sources such as treaties of Medical and Therapeutical Materials, as well as material sources available at the Pharmacy Museum of the Farmacia Monástica de la Real Cartuja de Valldemossa in Mallorca. I examined the old medicine containers and the labelling on ceramic recipients, glass jars and wooden boxes and other medicines found inside them. RESULTS Different medicines, the most used over the centuries to treat diseases of the urinary system are described, including both simple (of plant, mineral or animal origin) and compound medicines: drumstick tree, agaricus, mechoacan, lupine, fennel, acacia gum, myrtle, Armenian bole, oleum scorpionum, hartshorn plantain, cantharides. I present evidence of knowledge available for each of these remedies in the main bibliographic sources, as well as proof that they were used in Valldemossa. CONCLUSIONS The basis of general and urological pharmacotherapy was concentrated on nature. Medicines of plant origin were the most used. The therapeutic inventory that mankind has accumulated throughout history is the result of a lengthy process of combining practices and knowledge of different cultures and societies.</dc:description>
