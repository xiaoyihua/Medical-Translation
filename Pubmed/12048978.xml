<dc:description xml:lang="en">We have carried out an active longitudinal study to analyze the results obtained in the treatment of obesity by means of educational measures and a visit to a nurse for follow-up every 15-30 days. A total of 116 patients have been treated over the last two years, following referral from the medical clinic of the Nutrition and Dietetics Unit with a diagnosis of obesity. These patients received instruction in healthy eating and they were monitored in groups of 4-5 individuals with a similar level of obesity, age and cultural level, or else individually in special cases. At the cut-off point, 26.7% of the patients continued to attend the follow-up clinic, 5.1% had completed the therapy and achieved the goal set (weight reduction of at least 10%), whereas 44% had abandoned the monitoring process, 15.5% were referred back to the medical clinic and 8.6% requested a voluntary discharge. The largest percentage decrease in the BMI (Body Mass Index) can be found among those who requested a voluntary discharge (ddd 12.8) over the others. By analyzing the change in the BMI between the start and the end of the process, we have found a non-uniform significant decrease (p nnn 0.001) between the different degrees. We feel that education in healthy eating provides patients with the necessary information for them to be able to achieve balanced eating habits as the basis for the treatment of obesity. Regular follow-up and group sessions reinforce their continuity with treatment and the achievement of the goals set.</dc:description>
