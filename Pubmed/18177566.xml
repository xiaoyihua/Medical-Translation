<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis has become the most common treatment in patients with ulcerative colitis. This procedure removes the entire colon, conserving the sphincteric complex and, therefore, preserving continence. The most important goal of this surgery is to improve quality of life. METHODS We reviewed the files of patients who underwent restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis from January 1995 to December 2004 . We administered questionnaire SF-36 to evaluate quality of life. We used an observational, retrospective, and transversal method. RESULTS Twenty "J" pouch procedures were done, of which files of 14 patients were reviewed. As far as quality of life, we were able to interview only eight patients and the average was as follows: physical function 75, physical status 50, corporal pain 51, general health 77, vitality 47.5, social function 62.50, emotional status 83 and mental health 74. DISCUSSION Previous reports exist showing that proctocolectomy is a safe and effective procedure for patients with ulcerative colitis and where ileostomy is accompanied by one definitive, independent continent or pouch. CONCLUSIONS The presence of stoma and fecal incontinence are factors that contribute to deterioration of quality of life after proctocolectomy; thus, both should be avoided. Of the patients who we interviewed, 87.5% consider that their health status has improved during 1 year.</dc:description>
