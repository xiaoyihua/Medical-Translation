<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To present a unified vision of the principal known mechanisms of neuroplasticity, emphasizing their universality. DEVELOPMENT The concept of the central nervous system as an immutable entity has been considerably modified during the second half of the 20th century. Neuroplasticity, that is the ability of the brain regarding change and repair is expressed in different ways, from functional modifications of existing structures to the formation, by growth and proliferation, of new structures and neurons. This study considers the molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuroplastic phenomena and classifies them into two main groups: plasticity due to growth, including the mechanisms of axonal regeneration, collateralization and reactive synaptogenesis; and functional plasticity, which includes changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission such as long-term potentiation and the activation of silent synapses. We also describe some of the relations of neuroplastic phenomena with disease of the central nervous system, together with examples of physiological, physical and pharmacological factors which may be used in future as therapeutic tools to stimulate and modulate neuroplasticity. CONCLUSION Neuroplastic mechanisms show a high degree of phylogenetic and ontogenetic conservation. They are important both in the genesis of disorders and disease of the nervous system and for its repair after different types of damage and trauma. Modulation of neuroplastic mechanisms by physical and chemical agents would appear to be one of the most powerful therapeutic tools of restorative neurology.</dc:description>
