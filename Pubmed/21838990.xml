<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE to know the peripheral arterial disease (PAD) prevalence and its determinants in a nationwide survey in Mexican population. METHODS baseline ankle brachial index (ABI) measured by Doppler was performed in patients at high vascular risk for PAD. ABI between 1 and 1.3 was regarded as normal. ABI ≤ 0.9 (a low ABI) was considered to be an indicator of PAD. ABI &gt; 1.3 (a high ABI) was also considered abnormal, as an indirect index of artery calcification and stiffness. RESULTS a total of 5 101 patients were evaluated: 1,212 patients (23.8 %) had ABI ≤ 0.9, and 431 (8.4 %) &gt; 1.3 (including 1 % with incompressible vessels). ABI ≤ 0.9 was associated with age, arterial hypertension, diabetes, current smoking, dyslipidemia and previous vascular events. On the other hand, ABI &gt; 1.3 was associated with male gender, diabetes, previous smoking habit and history of vascular events. A high proportion of patients (62.5 %) with established PAD, identified by a low ABI (≤ 0.9) were asymptomatic or with minimum symptoms at the time of their assessment. CONCLUSION a significant prevalence of abnormal ABI was identified. ABI measurement by Doppler can help to identify patients who need intense secondary prevention and more aggressive treatment of vascular risk factors.</dc:description>
