<dc:description xml:lang="en">The increase in knowledge, the advance of diagnostic or therapeutic technologies and the universal right to health demand new roles and responsibilities from health organizations beyond clinical care itself. These include the construction of health organizations of professionals and not with professionals, in which importance is placed on knowledge and this is applied to improved service. Other concepts bear importance and must be kept in mind: an organization as a tool, autonomous management of centers, new management of public services,... All these factors lead us to conclude that professionals must get involved, assuming risks and decision making capacities; there also exists a need to be judged by society about how the resources which citizens provide through their taxes are utilized by health organizations.</dc:description>
