<dc:description xml:lang="en">The etiology of marginal peri-implantitis describes an infectious factor and a biomechanical factor resulting from occlusal overload. Clinical and experimental articles oriented to the biomechanical factor are scarce, so as the studies about the histology associated to periimplantitis. We present a case of marginal peri-implantitis on an implant in the mandibular molar zone caused by occlusal overload, which led to an osseous defect on the marginal crest. The treatment was composed of occlusal adjustment, removal of contaminated surgical tissue, and autogenous bone graft, which varies from the common treatment of infectious peri-implantitis. Histologic analysis of peri-implantitis tissue reveals a juxtaepithelial lympho-plasmocytorious infiltrate and a central zone of dense fibro-connective tissue with scanty inflammatory cells, which differs from the chronic inflammatory tissue associated with infectious peri-implantitis. Clinical and radiographic followup control after 12 months evidenced the remission of the symptoms and bone regeneration on the marginal crest. We consider that in the treatment of marginal peri-implantitis, it is necessary to continue the studies on the histological differences between the infectious types and those that are caused by occlusal overload.</dc:description>
