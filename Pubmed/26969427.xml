<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE S100B protein is a serum marker of cerebral damage. The objective was to evaluate the brain damage caused by general anaesthesia, by determining the concentration of serum S100B protein before and after of general anaesthesia. PATIENTS AND METHOD Patients with chronic adenotonsillar hypertrophy and indications for tonsillectomy were included. A venous blood sample was taken from the patients before general anaesthesia (basal sample). The patients were anaesthetised using the following intravenous anaesthetic drugs: midazolam, fentanyl and propofol; and inhaled sevoflurane. A second venous blood sample (postoperative sample) was taken from patients after the surgery, in the operating room. The concentration of serum S100B protein was determined in the basal sample (S100Bb) and postoperative sample (S100Bp) by immunoassay electro-chemiluminescence in MODULAR E-170 (Roche Diagnostics). RESULTS Seventy-six patients were included, 46 males and 30 females, aged between 3 to 14 (median 5 years). In all the patients, serum S100B protein levels increased after general anaesthesia. The values of S100Bp (median 164.0 ng/L) were significantly higher than the values of S100Bb (median 94.5 ng/L). The median of the difference between S100Bp and S100Bb was 58.0 ng/L. There were statistically significant differences between S100Bb and S100Bp using the Wilcoxon test (P&lt;.0001). CONCLUSIONS The concentration of serum S100B protein increased significantly after general anaesthesia. This indicates that general anaesthesia may cause brain damage.</dc:description>
