<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION There is evidence of the protective effect of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol against atheroma plaque formation and of its role in cholesterol efflux from cells, as well as its anti-oxidative and inflammatory modulating response properties. Low HDL-cholesterol levels have been associated with a prothrombotic state. OBJECTIVE To determine the relationship between HDL-cholesterol and lipidic and hemostatic parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied 110 children (50 girls, 60 boys) aged between 6 and 7 years old. Lipid profile, D-dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) and fibrinogen were determined. RESULTS The mean values of the studied parameters were as follows: total cholesterol (192.92+/-26.01 mg/dl), HDL-cholesterol (72.87+/-15.69 mg/dl), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (109.46+/-23.30 mg/dl), triglycerides (56.24+/-20.35 mg/dl), apolipoprotein B (91.96+/-14.93 mg/dl), apolipoprotein A1 (168.4+/-24.55 mg/dl), lipoprotein(a) logarithm (1.76+/-1.36 mg/dl), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 logarithm (PAI-1) (3.77+/-3.93 U/ml), D-dimer logarithm (5.53+/-0.49 ng/ml) and fibrinogen (268.61+/-48.59 mg/dl). When the sample was divided into two groups according to HDL-cholesterol levels, children with lower levels showed significantly higher values of total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol, fibrinogen and PAI. HDL-cholesterol levels were directly and significantly associated with total cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 and negatively and significantly associated with the total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio, fibrinogen and PAI. CONCLUSION The children studied had high HDL-cholesterol levels, which could be responsible for the high total cholesterol levels. High values of HDL-cholesterol are significantly associated with a reduction in thrombotic risk.</dc:description>
