<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND There are different diseases which are associated with articular chondrocalcinosis (ACC) although in some it is debated whether this is a real association or an accidental coexistence. The aim of the present study was to analyze the prevalence and type of associated diseases in a series of patients with ACC and to compare with other series in the literature, as well as determine the performance of a protocol directed to the search for such diseases in patients with ACC. METHOD A total of 95 patients diagnosed of ACC and attended in the out patients department of Rheumatology in a general hospital over a 5 year period (1987-1991) were included in a protocol specially designed to search for diseases associated to ACC. RESULTS Twelve (13%) of these patients had one of the diseases classically associated to ACC: gout in 8 cases, hypothyroidism in 2 cases and hyperparathyroidism, adult hemochromatosis and hypophosphatasia in one case each (in one patient two of these diseases coexisted). In most of the patients with secondary ACC the coexisting disease had already been diagnosed. Only two patients (one with hypothyroidism and the other with adult hypophosphatasia) were aided by the application of the protocol and were diagnosed having ACC as the only guiding sign. CONCLUSIONS The number of diseases associated in patients with articular chondrocalcinosis is relatively low. In the absence of clinical suspicion the performance of different laboratory investigations for diagnosis of diseases related with articular chondrocalcinosis is of little benefit.</dc:description>
