<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To describe levels of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in various public places in Barcelona (Spain). MATERIAL AND METHOD Vapor-phase nicotine was measured with passive samplers containing a sodium bisulfate treated filter with a 37 mm diameter. The places sampled were primary and secondary schools, hospitals, primary care centers, train stations, subways, universities, airports, restaurants and discotheques. RESULTS Primary and secondary schools and health centers had the lowest levels of ETS exposure, with mean concentrations of less than 1 microg/m3. The mean values found in transport and universities were 2.16 microg/m3 in train stations, 3.30 microg/m3 in subways, 4.30 microg/m3 in airports and 4.97 microg/m3 in universities. The highest concentrations were found in restaurants and discotheques, with mean values of 12.36 microg/m3 in restaurants and 130.65 microg/m3 in discotheques. All samples taken from primary and secondary schools, airports, subways, restaurants and discotheques contained ETS. Likewise, 90% of the samples taken from train stations and 96% of those from universities contained ETS. Seventy-nine percent of the samples from hospitals and 58% of those from primary care centers contained ETS. CONCLUSIONS The results confirm that passive smoking is an important public health problem in Spain and that greater efforts are needed to enforce smoke-free policies in public spaces and workplaces.</dc:description>
