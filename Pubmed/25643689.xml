<dc:description xml:lang="en">Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most frequent alteration in eating behavior and can affect adolescents. The aim was to determine the prevalence of BED, risk factors, and its association with obesity in adolescents in a secondary education institution of Barquisimeto, Venezuela, between September 2013 and February 2014. A sample of 500 adolescents of both sexes (252 male), between 11 and 18 years of age was studied. A questionnaire was applied and anthropometric measurements were performed: weight, height, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-height index. According to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - V, the prevalence of BED was 7.80%. Risk factors were male gender, age &gt; 14 years, body image dissatisfaction, family dysfunction, depressive symptoms and perceived stress. Binge eating disorder was a risk factor for global obesity and central obesity. The prevalence of BED was higher than internationally found for the general population. Important psychosocial risk factors that should be considered in the implementation of prevention and control strategies were identified.</dc:description>
