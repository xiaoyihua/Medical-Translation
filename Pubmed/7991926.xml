<dc:description xml:lang="en">We have performed 2 implantations of transvenous automatic cardioverter defibrillator in a cardiac laboratory devoted to electrophysiology and pacemaker implantation. This is a preliminary experience with a novel implant strategy. Cardiologists were the primary operators. The automatic cardioverter defibrillator were placed in a subcutaneous pectoral region, with a non-thoracotomy lead system. The automatic cardioverter defibrillator were two Medtronic 7219D PCD Jewel, with a Transvene system. There were no perioperative complications. Acceptable defibrillation threshold were obtained in both patients, 12 and 20 J, respectively. Leads were inserted percutaneously through the left subclavian vein. After 8 months of follow-up the patients continue to tolerate the device satisfactorily. Implantation of automatic cardioverter defibrillator systems by trained cardiologists in an electrophysiology laboratory is safe and feasible. Moreover, its cost-effectiveness is superior, the saving includes the surgeons, and the reduction of stay in unit of intensive care and hospitalization.</dc:description>
