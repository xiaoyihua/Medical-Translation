<dc:description xml:lang="en">A study of the 1963-1965 eruptions of the Irazú volcano (Costa Rica) showed that the ashes altered the ecological conditions of a great number of insects. Experiments suggest a mechanical action of the abrasive particles on the epicuticle, making it permeable, and thus accelerating dehydration. Other insects, such as the honey bee (Apis mellifera), were not affected externally but through the ingestion of ash-contaminated nectar and by the massive destruction of the vegetation on which they depended. Great destruction of bee populations was observed during 1964 and 1965-66 in the San José area. On the other hand, the volcanic ash apparently favored other insects, especially those protected by a waxy secretion, and by the possible elimination of their natural enemies, to such proportions that they became pests of economic significance.</dc:description>
