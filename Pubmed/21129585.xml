<dc:description xml:lang="en">The major advances produced in infectious diseases, partly favored by technological development in the last few years, together with current changes in healthcare, have led to a new scenario in which, far from the control of infectious diseases, clinical microbiology has acquired an undoubted leading role. This new panorama implies collaboration among distinct health professionals within the same healthcare setting, with common and occasionally conflicting interests. Setting aside the individual differences that can be produced in the daily life of our hospitals, all health professionals should understand one another, not only because such cooperation is required for optimal patient care but also because synergistic collaboration among professions would improve professional development. Based on this principle of a multidisciplinary approach, collaboration and mutual respect, the moment seems opportune for the various professionals involved in infectious diseases (infectologists, internists, pediatricians and intensivists) to express their view of the specialty of clinical microbiology. The present article includes reflections, from a highly liberal and personal point of view, on how mutual relationships can be approached and on how greater knowledge of infectious diseases can continue to be gained in Spain. In all these reflections, the questions of where we come from and where we are going are explicit or implicit.</dc:description>
