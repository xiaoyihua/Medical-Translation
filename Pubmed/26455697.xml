<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Femoral hypoplasia-unusual facies syndrome is a rare disease with variable expressivity, although cases have been reported with an autosomal dominant pattern. It particularly affects the structures of the face associated with hypoplasia of the femur. Its aetiology is relatively unknown. However, this syndrome has been associated with maternal diabetes, drug exposure, viral infections, radiation, and oligohydramnios. OBJECTIVE The case of a newborn with this syndrome is presented. CLINICAL CASE Newborn of 41 weeks gestation with small nose, thin upper lip, micrognathia, long philtrum, low set ears, epicanthal folds, dysplastic hips showing flexion, and adduction of the right leg, and shortening at the expense of the thigh. X-ray images revealed femoral hypoplasia and dysplastic acetabular roof. Different physicians from other specialties who excluded other associated malformations performed a complete evaluation. Surgical bone lengthening of lower limb is scheduled at 5 months of age, with the purpose that she walks with her own feet; at the same time she began management with kinesiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Femoral hypoplasia-unusual facies syndrome is a rare condition. A multidisciplinary health care team must treat individuals with femoral hypoplasia-unusual facies syndrome.</dc:description>
