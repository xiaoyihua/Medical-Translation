<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this prospective study, the complications and mortality appeared in 50 exchange transfusions (ET) were analyzed. The ET were performed in 84% of the cases through a catheter in the umbilical vessels, 22 through both vessels, 10 by vein and 10 by umbilical artery; in the rest of cases by central vein. We found complications in 33% of the cases. Cardiac arrhythmia (23 cases) was the most frequent complication; also metabolic complications in 20 cases, septic complications in 10 cases (8 cases of omphalitis and 4 of sepsis were included), 8 cases of necrotizing enterocolitis and 3 of bleeding were found. Some of the newborns has 2 or more complications at the same time. The total lethality rate was 4% which occurred in 2 preterm infants with critical state. Our finding suggest that morbidity due to ET is highest than previously reports and maybe the mortality is due to the critical state of patients more than the ET.</dc:description>
