<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The prevalence of biliary lithiasis was studied in a sample of rural female population by calculation of the risk factors associated and the correlation between biliary lithiasis and serum lipoprotein concentrations. METHODS Two hundred forty-nine women between the ages of 20-75 years in whom complete anamnesis and calculation of the Quetelet index (QI) were performed, were the subjects of this study. The investigation of biliary lithiasis was carried out by echography. Serum lipoprotein concentrations were determined by sequential ultracentrifugation. RESULTS The prevalence of biliary lithiasis in the population studied was of 10.4%. A tendency to increase by age was observed and a peak between 50-60 years of age (p &lt; 0.05) was registered. Biliary lithiasis was more frequent among the obese population (p &lt; 0.05). With respect to lipoprotein parameters, all the lipid values of the different fractions demonstrated to be higher in the lithiasic population, although only the differences in cholesterol vehicled by very low density lipoproteins (C-VLDL) achieved statistical significance) (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of biliary lithiasis in the female population studied is similar to that reported in other Western populations, and an increasing tendency in the prevalence of biliary lithiasis with age and obesity was observed. The levels of C-VLDL are higher in women with biliary lithiasis than in those without.</dc:description>
