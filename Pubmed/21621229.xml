<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Patients admitted to Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Departments have an increased risk of ischemic stroke (IS). We analyzed clinical characteristics, quality of neurological care and mortality of in-hospital strokes (IHS) in these departments. PATIENTS AND METHOD Prospective registry of in-hospital ISs in Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery in 13 Spanish hospitals during 2008. Demographic, clinical and therapeutic data as well as mortality and functional evolution were recorded. RESULTS 73 patients were included. Mean age was 72±11.6 years. 75.4% of IS were cardioembolic. Special risk factors were presence of cardiac sources of embolism (86.3%), prior withdrawal of antithrombotic treatment (22%) and invasive procedures (65.7%). First neurological assessment was done in the first 3hours in 49.5% and beyond 24hours from IS onset in 20.5%. Ten patients were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, which was not possible in 8 patients because of the delay in calling the neurologist. Most frequent reasons for exclusion from thrombolytic therapy were recent major surgical procedures (33.3%) and anticoagulant therapy (38%). Three-month mortality was 15% and only 53.7% were functionally independent. Patients treated with thrombolysis had a better evolution (87.5% of independent patients, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS IS in Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery are mostly cardioembolic strokes and produce a high proportion of dependent patients. Patients treated with thrombolysis had a better evolution. Delays in contacting the neurologist led to exclusion from treatment an important proportion of patients who met thrombolysis criteria.</dc:description>
