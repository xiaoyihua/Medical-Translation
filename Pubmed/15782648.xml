<dc:description xml:lang="en">Frey syndrome has been observed especially in patients who have undergone a parotidectomy operation, but also in zoster herpes, in parotiditis, condilea fractures, obstetric traumatisms with forceps and in surgery of the meningioma of the cerebellopontine angle. It also appears without previous surgery, like in our case. In these circumstances it is believed that a clinical neuritis, primary or secondary to a neighbouring inflammation may cause the start of this disorder. Several treatments have been suggested which highlights the difficulty of them. The most effective one is the intradermic injection of botulinum toxin type A. Its use in Frey's syndrome was initiated by Drobik and Laskawi in 1995. Since then the references to its use are numerous. Nevertheless, it is a treatment which has been introduced very few times in our country.</dc:description>
