<dc:description xml:lang="en">The tremendous increase in research on adolescence over the past 20 years, and especially the last decade, has produced a great deal of knowledge about adolescent development and the development of problems during adolescence. This new knowledge should lead to more effective interventions. Although more research is needed on basic developmental processes and context influences, this is especially the case in the area of effective interventions. The next decade may bring significant new knowledge that will dramatically improve the lives of young people in the United States. This is desperately needed as the current status of youth must change.</dc:description>
