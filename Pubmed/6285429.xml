<dc:description xml:lang="en">Renal gluconeogenic capacity was enhanced to 150% 24 h after partial hepatectomy, remained increased at 48 h (144%) and returned to normal values at 72 h. Glucose production by renal cortical slices from hepatectomized rats was also enhanced 48 h after surgery when pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate and fructose were used as gluconeogenic precursors. The stimulation of renal gluconeogenic capacity seems to be due to the increase of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities which behaved similarly to glucose production after hepatectomy. The renal metabolic response may be partially due to starvation in the first 24 h. Afterwards food intake became normalized and the acceleration of glucose production should be attributed to hepatectomy. Since there was no metabolic acidosis in our experimental conditions the involvement of glucocorticoids in the stimulation of renal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities is suggested.</dc:description>
