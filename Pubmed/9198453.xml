<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is described as a nerve injury arising from trauma. For practical management purposes, two general types of UNE have been defined. One group is comprised of those cases in which identifiable bone deformity is present at the elbow and the other comprises cases in which only nerve dysfunction is found. The concept of cubital tunnel syndrome is discussed, as is the importance of differential diagnosis and the use of diagnostic electrophysiology. Nerve transposition is considered the therapeutic measure of choice when UNE is a consequence of anomalous elbow, and the surgical criteria for cases in UNE behaves like similar to carpal tunnel syndrome is discussed. Electrophysiology can precisely locate the site of elbow involvement, suggesting either simple release of the cubital tunnel or more complex surgical procedures such as transposition or epicondylectomy.</dc:description>
