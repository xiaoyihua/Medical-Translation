<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To evaluate the importance of testicular and paratesticular prepubertal tumors in our center and to make an update on the topic. METHODS AND PATIENTS Data from all patients diagnosed of testicular and paratesticular prepubertal tumors and treated in our pediatric oncology unit from January 1st 1998 to December 31st 2003 have been revised. RESULTS Seven cases are reported among one hundred and ninety patients (represents 3,68 percent of all treated tumors): five tumors affecting the testis and two cases of paratesticular tumors. Pathology classification was as follows: one yolk sack tumor, one mature teratoma, two nongerminomatous testicular tumors (one Sertoli cell tumor and one unclassifiable), one Burkitt's lymphoma and two paratesticular rhabdomyosarcomas. Primary approach was inguinal radical orchiectomy in all cases except neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the case of lymphoma and partial escrotectomy in one patient previously managed with transcrotal orchiectomy. Rhabdomyosarcoma cases received adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients are alive and well after a follow-up period ranging from 17 to 74 months. CONCLUSIONS Testicular and paratesticular prepubertal tumors are rare. Except for one patient affected of lymphoma, surgical primary approach have been essential for treatment. The prognoses in this series has been excellent.</dc:description>
