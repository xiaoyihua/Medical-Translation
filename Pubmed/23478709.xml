<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Given the high prevalence of the hospitable malnutrition (from 30 % to 50%) there is imposed to determine to the admission the nutritional status of the patients. With it one would manage to identify those individuals in condition of malnutrition and to treat them, which would allow to shorten his/her hospitable stay and to reduce the sanitary bill. For it, we must elaborate a nutritional screening tool of high sensibility and specificity, related in addition to a low cost and rapidity. OBJECTIVE To validate a screening nutritional program, called HEMAN, which allows us to discriminate against the undernourished patients to the hospitable admission, comparing it with a method already standardized as the NRS 2002. METHODS Patients evaluated to the admission of the services of Internal Medicine and Oncology of the General Universitary Hospital of Valencia with the method HEMAN and the NRS 2002 simultaneously. RESULTS There were examined 112 different patients, 63 men and 49 women. The method HEMAN obtained 8 more patients in nutritional risk that the NRS 2002, with a percentage of patients in risk of 74% and 67%, respectively. The sensibility of the method HEMAN was 100 % and the specificity was 80% compared to the NRS 2002. CONCLUSION Due to the fact that HEMAN evaluates separately IMC, weight loss and variation of the ingestion we can classify the undernourished patients with major precision and discriminate between them to know which needs a major nutritional attention, on the basis of the criteria of the phase III of the HEMAN´s method.</dc:description>
