<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Describing the use of the Papanicolau (Pap) test and the main factors related to using screening amongst Colombian women aged 25 to 69 years. METHODS Information was taken from the 2005 National Health and Demography Survey. The variable "pap test during the last three years" was calculated; coverage and related factors were described using simple percentages and multivariate analysis using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS Recent Pap test coverage in Colombian women aged 25 to 69 years was 76.5 %. Factors associated with the absence of recent exam included non-affiliation to the health system, affiliation to the susbsidiary regimen, having no live-born children and no recent medical consultation. Factors associated with recent coverage were income level, being aged 35 to 44, a higher educational level and being pregnant. CONCLUSIONS Results indicated the need for efforts at increasing coverage amongst the poorer population as well as amongst women from the subsidiary regimen and those having no affiliation. Persistence of high mortality in spite of acceptable coverage suggested the need for more efforts regarding definitive diagnosis and opportune treatment.</dc:description>
