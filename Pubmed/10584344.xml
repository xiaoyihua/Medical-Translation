<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES In situ carcinoma (isT) of the bladder is a poor prognostic tumour with a natural progressive evolution. Treatment with BCG achieves a significant improvement in survival. This paper analyses our experience in the management of isT patients with endovesical BCG. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 1983 and 1997 the Urology Unit in the Móstoles Hospital saw 636 patients with transitional carcinoma of the bladder. Of these, 498 (78%) were surface tumours, and 138 (22%) were infiltrant. isT: 80 patients (13%), 14 of which were primary (17%), 37 associated to a surface tumour (46%), and 29 to infiltrant tumours (36%). All surface tumours: isT was present in 51 patients (10%) 44 of which were managed with 2 courses of BCG Connaught (81 mg), for 6 weeks each followed by vesical reassessment. Quarterly follow-up was conducted during a 2-year period. Patients not managed with BCG were treated with radical cystectomy. An analysis was made of patients without complete response to BCG, as well as actuarial analysis of disease-free survival (DFS), survival until progression (SUP) and specific survival (SS). All possible prognostic factors are analyzed: sex, focal isT (a single focus) or diffuse isT (more than one focus). Primary or secondary isT and association to G1, G2 or G3 tumours. RESULTS In all 44 patients managed with BCG: males 37 (84%), females 7 (16%), primary 14 (32%), focal 22 (50%), diffuse 22 (50%). Six patients died (5 because of the tumour). Mean follow-up of living patients: 3.7 years (0.5-7.5 years). After the 2 BCG courses, 36 (82%) showed complete response. Thirteen patients (30%) had no complete response during follow-up, and 11 (85%) continued to progression. In total 7 patients underwent cystectomy. Of 5 patients directly cystectomized due to persistence of isT or T1G3 tumour at monitoring after BCG, 2 (40%) had infiltrant tumour and one (20%) nodular metastasis. Three patients with persistent isT or T1G3 after BCG were not initially cystectomized: two that were treated with other endovesical therapies because of their age progressed, and the third one underwent a third BCG course and required cystectomy due to tumour persistency. 5-year DFS: 56%, being diffuse isT vs. focal isT (p = 0.0206) was an unfavourable prognostic factor. 5-year SUP: 63%, no significant prognostic factor. 5-year SS: 79%, being a female was an unfavourable prognostic factor (p = 0.0201). CONCLUSIONS Based on our results and the analysis of the literature we recommend treatment with 2 BCG courses of all isTs of the bladder that present some of the following factors: Diffuse cancer associated to T1G3, involvement of prostatic urethra or overexpression of p53 over 20%. In the rest of vesical tumours, one BCG course followed by a second one if lack of response to the first. After failure of both BCG courses, cystectomy must be performed in both groups.</dc:description>
