<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Determine the efficacy of percutaneous surgical treatment for talalgia due to a calcaneal spur. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is an observational, descriptive, clinical series analyzing the outcomes of 10 patients with a diagnosis of talalgia due to plantar fasciitis with a calcaneal spur treated with percutaneous foot surgery. The end result was assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS) to measure pain, the patients' opinion and their return to activities of daily living. Central tendency and scatter measurements were calculated. The inferential analysis was done with the non-parametric chi square (chi2) test. RESULTS Most patients were females (90%) and mean age was 40.5 years. Follow-up was 12 months. One patient had bleeding of the approached area. Pain was reduced from 8 to 1.5 in the VAS. Nine patients returned to their activities. Two patients had occasional mild pain upon prolonged bipedestation. Ninety percent of results were satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous foot surgery in talalgias caused by plantar fasciitis due to a calcaneal spur is a simple and effective method. It reduces the operative time and allows for an early return of patients to their activities of daily living.</dc:description>
