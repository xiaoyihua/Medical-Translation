<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the last few years molecular genetic studies of childhood cancer have acquired great importance. Advances in these techniques have increased knowledge of the various genes involved in tumoral development. Genetic alterations can occur in three large groups of genes: oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair genes. Cytogenetic analyses (karyotyping) are complemented by various molecular techniques, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and spectral karyotyping (SKY). These are the most reliable techniques and improve the sensitivity of karyotyping. The present article reviews the most representative and best characterized genes involved in the molecular etiology of childhood cancer, both hematologic malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma) and solid tumors (brain tumors, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma and retinoblastoma). Molecular techniques have enabled more precise diagnosis as well as identification of new prognostic factors and the development of more effective treatments. These techniques can also be useful in identifying minimal residual disease during and after treatment for leukemias, neuroblastomas and sarcomas, with the aim of predicting recurrence.</dc:description>
