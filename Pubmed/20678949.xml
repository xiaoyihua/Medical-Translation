<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To verify that implementing a policy of management by objectives, based on collaboration between hospital pharmacy, primary care and specialised medical managers, improves prescription quality indicators in specialised care and reduces unwanted "induced" prescriptions (i.e. those issued by specialists, hospital doctors or the patients themselves) in primary care. METHOD A four year quasi-experimental controlled intervention study on prescription at discharge and in outpatient hospital consultations was conducted. In hospital A, a quality cycle was applied: assessment, identifying improvement opportunities, implementing corrective actions and re-assessment. However, it was not applied in control hospital B. The indicators chosen were the percentage of generic medicines prescribed, the percentage of prescriptions for new therapies with no added value and the percentage of prescriptions for ACE inhibitors recommended. RESULTS In hospital A, an increase in indicators 1 and 3 has been observed, both being statistically significant, between the last year of intervention and the year previous to intervention. Hospital A managed to reduce indicator 2 to 4.5%, while this indicator increased in hospital B to 8.8%. Furthermore, a statistically significant difference in indicators between the two hospitals has been registered. CONCLUSION Pay-for-Performance programs in prescription practices of hospital physicians are effective actions to improve quality indicators of medication use.</dc:description>
