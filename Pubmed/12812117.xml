<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of AM3 (Inmunoferon) in the treatment of the recurrent cystitis in women in order to know the rate of good results, previously to design a clinical trial. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-four women who had been diagnosed of two cystitis episodes in the previous 6 months without cure by antibiotic treatment were admitted to the study. Standard antibiotic treatment and 3 daily grammes of AM3 was given for 9 months. Infection and irritative symptoms during micturition rate were evaluated at the inclusion date and afterwards, at the first, third, sixth and nineth month. RESULTS Nineteen patients finished the study. The infection rate decreased from 100% at the inclusion date to 26% in the first month and then it became stable about 50%. Irritative symptoms during micturition decreased from 46% at the inclusion date to a rate lower than 10% in the 4 controls running. CONCLUSION AM3 reduced evident urinary infection in a 50% and irritative symptoms during micturition in a 90%. Control clinical trials are needed to confirm the AM3 effects on this pathology.</dc:description>
