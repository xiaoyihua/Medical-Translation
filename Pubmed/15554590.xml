<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent malignant tumor in the head and neck. As in most malignant tumors, the earlier the diagnosis, is made the longer the survivalis. Several molecules, including CEA and Cyfra 21.1, have been evaluated in an attempt to improve diagnosis and follow-up. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether CEA and Cyfra 21.1 present pathological increased values prior to treatment, and to correlate tumor and patient characteristics with CEA and Cyfra 21.1 levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS CEA and Cyfra 21.1 were measured pre-treatment in sera of 252 patients treated for head and neck tumors from1999 to 2003. RESULTS Increases of CEA were detected in 23.6%, and increases of Cyfra 21.1 in 19.1% of patients. Significative differences were found between the concentrations of Cyfra 21.1 related to the tumor stage, local extension, histological grade, and an increasing relation with age. No differences were found in relation to the primary tumor site. Regarding CEA, the only finding was an increased relation between concentrations of this marker and cigarette and alcohol habits. CONCLUSIONS Cyfra 21.1 does not appear to be a good marker for tumoral screening of head and neck carcinomas. However, a good correlation was observed between sera concentrations of Cyfra 21.1, tumoral burden, and histological grade of the tumor, but this was not the case with CEA.</dc:description>
