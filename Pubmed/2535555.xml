<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to establish a preliminary information about the penetration of delta infection in our population, 40 HBsAg positive sera were tested for antidelta. 20 were asymptomatic patients and 20 were symptomatics. In the group of asymptomatic patients 3 belong to a high risk population: 1 homosexual, 1 dialysis patient, 1 nurse of dialysis unit. None of the patients of this group were positive for antidelta. In the group of symptomatics one was positive for antidelta. It's represents a seroprevalence of 5%. This patient was an indian who lives in the city but was born in Perijá where severe epidemics have been reported. These results support that the infection seems to be restricted to this indigenous group but the spread must be considered because the patient was living in the city. In addition, the use of antidelta as the unique serologic marker should undervalue the real prevalence of infection in the cases of acute hepatitis, which represent the majority of symptomatics patients. In consequence the paper of delta agent must be considered in the genesis of hepatitis in our population as well as its further epidemiologic course.</dc:description>
