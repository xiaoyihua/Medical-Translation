<dc:description xml:lang="en">Infection by Strongyloides stercoralis can cause asthma-like symptoms through mechanisms that have not yet been clarified. A 55-year-old male farm worker with a 2-year history of illness diagnosed as asthma and treated unsuccessfully with bronchodilators and corticosteroids was referred to our hospital with severe dyspnea. The initial chest radiograph showed mild air trapping, and pulmonary function tests detected airway obstruction that did not respond to salbutamol. Bronchoscopy revealed multiple nodules protruding into the airway lumen. S. stercoralis larvae were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and stool samples. Although treatment with albendazole was initiated, the patient's condition worsened over the next 3 days, hemoptysis presented, and the process ended in death. Autopsy demonstrated Strongyloides larvae in the bronchial nodules. Infection by S. stercoralis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of asthmatic-like symptoms refractory to treatment. In such cases nodules may be responsible for obstruction.</dc:description>
