<dc:description xml:lang="en">Bilateral pure facets dislocation in the thoracic spine is rare, but when it does occur in almost every instance produces a severe spinal cord lesion. It is thought to be caused by a flexion distraction mechanisms in most of the cases. A case is presented of a male suffered a polytrauma with important thoracic, abdominal, and esqueletic injuries in a car accident. The patient was in a hospital during two weeks, and one month after the trauma a bilateral pure dislocation of T11-T12 facets was diagnosed. Diagnosis was made with radiographs and CT with sagittal reconstruction. After an open reduction and fixation, recovery was complete within the first postoperative week. Facet dislocation in the thoracic spine is associated in many cases with thoracic and abdominal injuries that worsen the clinical picture, and thus it may contribute to misdiagnosis of the facet dislocation, specially in the cases with no neurological symptoms, adding a risk of secondary spinal cord damage. High-resolution CT with sagittal reconstruction provides an adequate and rapid demonstration of the luxation and associated thoraco-abdominal damages. Facet dislocation are unstable injuries that require open reduction and fixation. Recovery of patients with incomplete lesions is frequent, however, recovery from complete lesions did not occur.</dc:description>
