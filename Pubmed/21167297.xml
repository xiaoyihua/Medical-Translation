<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Chromomycosis is a subcutaneous mycosis caused by dematiaceous fungi. It is characterized by the presence of nodules, verrucous and atrophic lesions, and is prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas. Mexico ranks third among the subcutaneous mycoses, mainly affecting the lower limbs. The verrucous lesions are the most common clinical presentation. AIMS We present a case of chromomycosis located in the helix and the left earlobe in a 29 year-old male, with unusual morphology and topography. METHOD Samples from the affected ear were taken for direct examination, and cultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar and mycobiotic agar. RESULTS Fumagoid cells were found when examining the lesion scrapings under direct microscopic examination. The Sabouraud dextrose agar and mycobiotic agar developed a colony of black fungus, which in the microscopic study was identified as Fonsecaea pedrosoi. The definitive diagnosis was chromomycosis, a pathology that was treated with itraconazole 200mg daily for 10 weeks, with a complete resolution of the dermatosis. CONCLUSIONS This is a case of chromomycosis with unusual clinical features, with an appropriate response to treatment with itraconazole.</dc:description>
