<dc:description xml:lang="en">The duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with an infectious process is based on empirical considerations and those with intraabdominal infections are no exception. Therefore, the recommended duration of antibiotic therapy in intraabdominal infection is controversial and no consensus has been reached due to the lack of controlled studies that would provide sufficient scientific evidence. Excessive duration of antibiotic therapy can increase the risk of developing bacterial resistance as well as treatment-associated costs. These considerations have led to the exploration of "short-term treatment" strategies, lasting 3-5 days, with encouraging results. However, the development of biomarkers such as procalcitonin opens the door to individualized treatment that might allow the duration of antibiotic treatment in intraabdominal and other infections to be individually tailed to patient response.</dc:description>
