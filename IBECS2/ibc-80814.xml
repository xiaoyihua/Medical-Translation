<dc:description xml:lang="es">The transplant offer the best quality of life to patients whose suffer from advanced chronic renal failure. This work was undertaken to know the lifestyle and macronutrients consume patterns in patients from the Mexican Institute for Social Security whose received a transplanted kidney . Demographic and anthropometric information were obtained from 119 transplanted patients and consume patterns were obtained from them through the recall of 24 hours. The IMEVID questionnaire was used to assess the lifestyle in this population. This instrument was previously validated for its reliability, its showed a value of 0.681 for alpha of Cronbach and 0.685 for Spearman-Brown test. The 70% of the patients showed less favourable lifestyles and there were no differences between genders. There were significative differences among states of the country where the subjects lived; attending the following domains of the IMEVID questionnaire. Information, physical activity and adjustment to the treatment (p &lt; 0.001). In those States near the american border the BMI was superior to the 25 kg/m2, there were significatives differences attending ideal and real ingestion among States of the country, (p &lt; 0.05). The protein consumption was higher in patients living in Michoacan to those reported from patients living in other states of the country (p &lt; 0.05)and the lipids consumption was higher in Nuevo Leon in comparison with those reported from patients living in other states of the country (p &lt; 0.05). It is frequent to find non favourable lifestyles in patients with transplant of the kidney, even when they practices physical exercise. The promotion of healthy lifestyles via educative strategies of high impact, in patients with transplant is necessary to avoid highly cost complications and rejection of the graft (AU)</dc:description>
