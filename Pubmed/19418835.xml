<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The prostate biopsy guided by ultrasound is the method of choice for early diagnosis of prostate cancer, is a safe whose main trouble is that it feels discomfort during the procedure. MATERIAL AND METHODS From July 2004 until March 2005 we prospectively studied 114 patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided needle biopsy of the prostate, they were divided in two groups: in one group we used lidocaina gel 2% inside the rectum before the procedure and in the other group we did not use it. We compared the pain that patients felt during the procedure with a pain scale. RESULTS We did not find differences between both groups, but the patients in whom we used a new needle felt less pain than the patients in whom we used a re-esterilized one. CONCLUSIONS The use of lidocaine gel intrarectal 2% before a prostate biopsy guided by ultrasound did not diminish the sensation of pain from the procedure in our patients, which was increased by the use of sterilized needles.</dc:description>
