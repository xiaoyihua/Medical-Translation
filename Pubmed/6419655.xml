<dc:description xml:lang="en">Authors present miocardiac perforation in two children 41 and 20 days old respectively, in whom a central venous catheter by phlebotomy for administration of fluids and parenteral nutrition was introduced: the end of the catheter was left at the level of right auricule. In the first case the perforation presented two hours after introducing the catheter, and in the second case, perforation was later. In neither case were there clinical signs of cardiac tamponade, and an unexpected heart respiratory arrest occurred which was reanimated by a pericardial punction. In the second case perforation was discovered by means of necroscopic study.</dc:description>
