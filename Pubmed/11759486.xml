<dc:description xml:lang="en">It is not a trivial matter to think about the topic of training neurosurgeons in Spain. To raise the question, I review the requirements in several countries. I comment on the process of selection, the length of training, the control of quality in the training program and the opportunities for clinical research in hospitals and in basic neurosciences. I express my opinion against a compulsory final exam. I propose that residents should inform the local or regional Health and Education Authorities about the dedication of staff members to training of postgraduate doctors and that this report should be taken into account and compensated economically in a proportional way to their efforts.</dc:description>
