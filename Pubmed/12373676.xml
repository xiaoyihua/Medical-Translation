<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Intracranial aneurysms are one of the most frequent vascular diseases. Nevertheless, saccular aneurysms that are not due to an inflammatory aetiology, which are located in the peripheral segment of the posterior circulation, are extremely rare. They are most frequently located in the thickest arterial branches within the region of the anterior brain circulation, as is the case of the complex made up of the anterior cerebral artery posterior communicating artery, middle cerebral artery and posterior communicating artery. No clinical manifestations are produced in many of these aneurysms, and their rupture and the subsequent development of a subarachnoid haemorrhage is the cause of the most intense neurological damage, which on occasions can lead to fatal consequences. CASE REPORT We report the case of a patient who was a carrier of distal aneurysm, located in the posterior region of the brain circulation, and also the neuroradiological findings, the form of clinical presentation and surgical treatment carried out, which allowed us to identify and close the afferent vessel and the resection of the aneurysmatic sac. CONCLUSION From the presentation of the symptoms of this patient in the form of a subarachnoid haemorrhage, accompanied by a subdural haematoma, it could be inferred that these clinical and imagenological findings point to the rupture of a distal aneurysm. Application of the stereotactic approach would be one of the first choice treatments for aneurysms in the distal region if we bear in mind the characteristics of the afferent vessel, the size of the neck and the morphology of the sac</dc:description>
