<dc:description xml:lang="en">Chronic abdominal pain is highly prevalent in school-aged children and is one of the most frequent disorders in our environment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of capsule endoscopy (CE) in patients with chronic abdominal pain. Sixteen patients (nine boys and seven girls), aged between 5 and 16 years old, with chronic abdominal pain for at least 12 months were studied. In all patients the results of hemograms, biochemical investigations, urine sediment test, Helicobacter pylori breath test and celiac serology were normal. In all children, gastroscopy, small bowel follow-through, abdominal ultrasound and colonoscopy were normal. All patients received CE by mouth. In 43.75 % of the patients studied (7/16), the capsule showed evidence of nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, mainly located in the ileum. In one girl, oxyuriasis was observed in the cecum and in another girl aphthous lesions were observed in the ileum. These lesions suggested small bowel Crohn's disease. CE mainly showed images compatible with nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, with unknown clinical significance. Consequently, we conclude that CE does not provide useful information in patients with abdominal pain without other symptoms.</dc:description>
