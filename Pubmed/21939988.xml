<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome characterized by acute necrosis of skeletal muscles along with the release of breakdown products into the bloodstream. Rhabdomyolysis is potentially lethal and its most serious complication is acute renal failure (ARF). Diagnosis is established by the 5-times elevation (975 UI/l) over the upper limit of creatine-kinase (CK). PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective study on Salamanca University Hospital for the period 1999-2010. There were 449 patients diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis over which we tested demographic, etiologic, analytic, complication and mortality variables. RESULTS Out of 449 patients, 69% were male. Average age was 66.5 ± 21 years. Most frequent etiologies were trauma, sepsis and immobility/crushing (24, 19 and 17% respectively). Maximum levels of CK were 343,170 ng/ml and its increase did not show significant association with mortality or ARF. This was found in 54% of patients (mean creatinine 3.03 mg/dl) and it was significantly associated with mortality (P &lt;. 001). Global mortality was 18.7%. There were no significant associations between mortality and unique or multiple causes. However, there were significant associations between mortality and age (P &lt;. 001) and 90% of deaths occurred among patients over 60 years old. CONCLUSION Rhabdomyolysis prevails in elder males. Trauma, sepsis and immobility/crushing are the most frequent etiologies. CK values are not related with ARF or mortality. Mortality is associated with most frequent causes, old age and ARF.</dc:description>
