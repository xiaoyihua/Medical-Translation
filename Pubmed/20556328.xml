<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Leukocytosis occurs as a response to a variety of inflammatory processes. AIM To determine if white blood cell count (WBCC) at admission among patients who suffer an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has an independent prognostic value for the occurrence of new cardiovascular adverse events (CAE). PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospective study of 558 patients aged 68 +/- 13 years (122 women) admitted to the hospital for an acute coronary syndrome. WBCC was measured at admission. A logistic regression model was used to assess the association of WBCC with the occurrence of CAE during the next six months after admission (post infarction angina, re-infarction, cardiac failure and mortality). RESULTS An univariate analysis showed that patients with a WBCC &gt; 15.000 cell/mm(3) had a significantly higher mortality and occurrence of CAE. The multivariate analysis showed that subjects with WBCC &lt; 10.000 cell/mm(3) experienced fewer CAE than subjects with a WBCC &gt; 15.000 cell/mm(3), with an odds ratio of 0.46 (95% confidence intervals = 0.21-0.97, p = 0,042). CONCLUSIONS An elevated WBCC at admission among patients with an ACS is associated with a higher incidence of CAE in the ensuing six months.</dc:description>
