<dc:description xml:lang="en">This descriptive study with qualitative approach analyzes the knowledge of individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) concerning their health rights. Open interviews were conducted with 12 individuals with DM in a university center in the interior of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Content analysis enabled the identification of two categories: the users' (lack of) knowledge concerning their rights and the unaware exercise of their rights. The results revealed that despite the legal advancements achieved in public policies, most users with DM are unaware of their rights, although they use the benefits that accrue from law in an unconscious way. Providing complete and sufficient information is essential so that individuals are able to make the best decision in relation to their treatment, preserving their autonomy.</dc:description>
