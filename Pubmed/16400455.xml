<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study discusses how basic and secondary students from public schools in La Paz (Bolivia) are exposed to risk factors included in 7 areas (behavior, mental health, social abilities, family, school, peers and recreation). The sample was selected from three schools, totaling 88 students, most of whom came from the last 2 years of basic education. Participants were divided in two groups: case (consumed alcohol and/or drugs) and control (did not consume). The results evidenced risk factors among students in the case group, clearly demonstrating the presence of socioeconomic factors. Youths in the control group also showed their vulnerability in some areas (behavior, recreation and school) but identified family as a significant protection factor in comparison with the case group.</dc:description>
