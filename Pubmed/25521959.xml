<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Evaluating language development by comparing the Munich Development method to the Early Language Milestone scale for identifying both diagnostic tests' agreement and enriching neurodevelopmental consultation. METHODS The clinical histories of a cohort of 129 children were evaluated, as prematurity is a risk factor for deviation in children's language development. The children had less than 40 weeks gestational age and 0 to 12 months corrected age. They were given both tests between 2008 and 2011. The results from both scales were compared regarding receptive and expressive language and visual response (Early Language Milestone scale) and evaluation of verbal response, vocal play, understanding and expression (Munich scale). Student's T-test was used for comparing means for paired samples. Results: A statistically significant correlation (p&lt;0.05) was found between both tests and between them and corrected age. It was seen that the higher the corrected age, the greater correlation there was between tests. CONCLUSION The Early Language Milestone and Munich Development scales, regarding their components dealing with language, both represent useful tools for following-up premature children's language development.</dc:description>
