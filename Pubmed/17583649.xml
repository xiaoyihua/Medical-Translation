<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION A basic indicator for assessing a program aimed at improving hand hygiene (HH) is the degree of compliance with the recommendations established for this purpose. The aim of this study is to investigate this indicator and related determinant factors in a general hospital. METHODS We performed 166 observation periods of one hour's duration, distributed over three work shifts and covering all the hospitalization units; 3957 HH opportunities were recorded. Variables associated with the observation period, the professionals involved and the medical activity taking place were also recorded. The Chi-square test, and calculation of the raw OR and the adjusted OR with a logistic regression model were used to study associations between the variables studied and failure to perform HH. RESULTS The overall frequency of HH activity was 30%, ranging from 8.9% to 60.5% depending on the professional tasks involved. The most important independent risk factors for failure to perform HH were the following: no availability of alcohol in a pocket size bottle (OR: 2.3 [1.7-3.3]); medical activities carried out in the surgical unit (OR: 2.6 [2.0-3.3]); activities taking place before entering into contact with patients (OR: 3.2 [2.4-4.2]); and use of gloves during the activity (OR: 2.2 [1.6-3.2]). CONCLUSION The frequency of HH is low, but there are several potentially modifiable factors involved, which could improve with interventions. One example might be better education of hospital personnel on the importance of HH.</dc:description>
