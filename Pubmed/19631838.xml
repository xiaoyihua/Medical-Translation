<dc:description xml:lang="en">Atherothrombosis is a systemic disease that can manifest as involvement of distinct vascular territories; those most frequently leading to diagnosis being coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial vascular territories. Atheromatosis of the aorta or its branches can be asymptomatic or manifest clinically in the form of mesenteric ischemia or ischemic nephropathy. Atherothrombosis therefore involves distinct medical specialities and healthcare levels such as cardiology, neurology, nephrology, endocrinology, vascular surgery, internal medicine, and primary care. Simultaneous involvement of more than one vascular territory, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, requires a global, multidisciplinary and coordinated approach. Additionally, medical intervention should not be limited to treatment of the acute accident as prevention, both primary and secondary, is a key factor in the management of this disease. It is here that specialties with an overall view such as internal medicine or primary care are especially well placed to play a fundamental and coordinating role. This multidisciplinary intervention involves not only physicians but also other health professionals such as dieticians, physical exercise specialists and, especially, nurses, who should play a key role in controlling risk factors, in health education and in monitoring treatment adherence.</dc:description>
