<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The traditional health care model is currently facing new health requirements. The implementation of integrated urologic health systems can be one of the possible solutions to these needs. It is mandatory to explore a new health care model, which includes structural and organizational changes. The adequacy of the urology departments of IDCsalud-Madrid network hospitals, creating URORed, is a new system adaptable to constant changes, in order to offer professionalism and quality health care. OBJECTIVE To describe the administrative/clinic management in the urology service of a health care model of Hospitals network (URORed at IDCsalud. Madrid), that has been included in a model of an Integrated network in a health care service. METHODS In the period between November 2007 to October 2014, the urology departments of IDCsalud Madrid Group, have been included in a new organizational system, including 4 hospitals, currently with 27 urologists. Each center offers specific urologic services, sharing benefits and human resources. The same directive line leads all centers. RESULTS The model offers an integrated and uniform urologic service to a specific population of 811.390 habitants (Population Census 2012), with capability to treat specific urologic diseases and to perform a correct clinical follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Belonging to a health care model in network involves a change of attitude. It creates an organizational change, based on the processes and the results, which enables control of the management analytically, detecting the points that need to be optimized as well as those that are satisfactory. It implies developing a culture of learning and cooperation, so that the processes are fluent and have quality, to create clinical and technological projects in favor of new resource-generating research, based on the needs of the joint management of the hospitals network. The complexity of this model requires a work focused on the human resources, their concerns and their ability to coordinate actions to get results in terms of quality health care and professionalism.</dc:description>
