<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Evaluate the introduction of the enucleation with Holmium laser in our center, including the surgeon's learning curve by the analysis of the patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS 150 procedures have been analyzed in a retrospective manner with an average follow-up of 11 months. Qmax, IPSS and Qol have been determined before surgery, at 6 months and 12 months, realizing their statistic analysis. PSA was measured before surgery and after 3 months. Complications, surgical time and hospital stay have been analyzed. RESULTS Average patient age was 72, 4 years. Average prostatic size was of 71,3 gr (18-150). Average hospital stay was of 22 h. Qmax before surgery, 6 months, 12 months was of 7,53 ml/s, 23,24 ml/s and 21,62 ml/s being statistically significant (p&lt;0,01). Transfusion rate was of 1,3% and urethral stenosis rate of 4%. IPSS improvement at 6 and 12 months was statistically significant as well (p&lt;0, 01). CONCLUSIONS Enucleation with Holmium laser is a safe and effective technique with lower complication rate than TURP, included during the learning curve.</dc:description>
