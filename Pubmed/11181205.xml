<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Inhaled medication through dry powder inhalers is widely used in children, but pediatric studies focussing on the ages at which these devices can be used are sparse. OBJECTIVE To establish the difference in peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through Accuhaler and Turbuhaler in healthy children using a new device, In-check, and to determine the differences between the two different models of this device. METHODS PIF was measured in 64 healthy male children (mean age 11.2 years, range 8.8-14.7) by means of In-check and In-check Dial using Accuhaler and Turbuhaler resistances. The best attempt of three was chosen. Height,weight, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second were also measured. RESULTS Significant differences in PIF were found between the two inhalers: PIF In-check Accuhaler-PIF In-check Turbuhaler (134.4 +/- 15.5 L/min vs 99.9 6 +/- 11.1 L/min; p&lt;0,000) and PIF In-check Dial Accuhaler-PIF In-check Dial Turbuhaler (109.6+/-10.5 L/min vs 86.8+/-8.9 L/min; p&lt;0.000). The best correlation obtained among the different In-check measurements was between In-check Ac-cuhaler and In-check Turbuhaler (r=0.88; p&lt;0.001), and the worst was between In-check Dial Accuhaler and In-check Turbuhaler (r =0.71; p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS PIF through Accuhaler is significantly higher than that through Turbuhaler, although in both cases PIF was sufficient to provide adequate distribution of the inhaled medication in children aged 9-14 years. Consequently, in children younger than 9 years old, and especially during an asthma attack, In-check should be tried in order to discover whether the child is capable of using Turbuhaler correctly.</dc:description>
