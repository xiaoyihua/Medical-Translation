<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper studies all cases affected by 5 parotiditis from January to September 1986 (1767 cases) and 1987 (124 cases), as well as all patients with rubella reported in the same period in 1986 (584 cases) and 1987 (5 cases) in the province of Pinar del Río. The rise in the incidence of the two diseases with an annual basis per 100,000 population during 1986 in the different municipalities is emphasized. The overtly downward trend of these two diseases in 1987 after the administration of the triple viral vaccine--93% for mumps and 99.15% for rubella--is discussed. It was found that these two diseases affected more often school children (5-14 years). It was found that these two diseases are not frequent under the first year of life (76.4 and 120.1 cases per 100,000 population respectively). The percentage of vaccine effectiveness was documented--97.4% for parotiditis and 100% for rubella.</dc:description>
