<dc:description xml:lang="en">Parvovirus B19 infection is highly prevalent in children and the most common manifestation is a facial rash. In adults, acute polyarthritis and skin rash are often the presenting features. We report three patients with the disease. A 40-year-old female presenting with fever, myalgias and painful swelling of elbows, knees, wrists and feet, with functional limitation, after having a respiratory infection. Additionally, an erythematous skin rash appeared in both extremities. IgM antibodies against Parvovirus B19 were positive. The skin biopsy disclosed a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient was treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and antihistaminics. A 40-year-old female, presenting with skin rash and pain in wrists and hands. IgM antibodies against parvovirus were positive. The patient was treated successfully with acetaminophen. A 38-year-old male with psoriasis, presenting with generalized and progressive polyarthralgia. A Parvovirus viral load determination found 239000 copies of the virus and IgM antibodies were positive. He was successfully treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</dc:description>
