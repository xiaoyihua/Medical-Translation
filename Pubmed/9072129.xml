<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thoracic wall resections are performed to treat a wide variety of conditions. Reconstruction techniques have varied considerably since the introduction of synthetic prosthesis, the most recent of which are made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, or Gore-Tex). We describe our department's experience with PTFE prosthesis. PTFE was used in 21 patients treated for various diseases. Thirteen reconstructions were of the thoracic wall, 4 were of the diaphragm and 4 of the pericardium. Three of the 13 thoracic wall reconstructions involved bilateral myoplasty of the pectoralis major, 2 involved omentoplasty and 1 required use of a wide musculocutaneous flap. Complications included pneumonia in 2 cases and 1 seroma with chronic cutaneous fistula that required removal of the prosthesis after 9 months. Two patients died, 1 after 19 days and the other after 9 months, both as a result of causes unrelated to reconstruction. Follow-up of these patients ranged from 3 to 54 months. We recommend the prosthetic use of PTFE for thoracic wall reconstruction, along with plasty or musculocutaneous flaps when necessary.</dc:description>
