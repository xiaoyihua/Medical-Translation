<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since chylothorax is uncommon and has multiple causes, its best treatment choice is not clear. Recent reports show that octreotide is useful in the treatment of chylothorax secondary to cancer or caused by surgical procedures. We report a 21 years old male with a chylothorax secondary to a non Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment with octreotide changed the color and triglyceride content of pleural effusion. Serum albumin and proteins increased and the effusion subsided after the second cycle of chemotherapy with CHOP. Thus octreotide was discontinued on the 27th day of therapy and pleural drainages were withdrawn. He was discharged in good conditions, 38 days after admission.</dc:description>
