<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this paper, historical reference is made about legal provisions for recognition of the training and certification of medical specialists in Peru through university programs provided since 1928 and culminating in 1973 with the legal authorization by the relevant state authority to implement the Second Specialization Program in Human Medicine and to grant the Certification of Specialist in the Name of the Nation upon completion of a university residency program and specialized training by the &#147;regular modality&#148;, and the recognition by the university with the &#147;non-regular modality&#148;. In Peru it has been established to the present that the Professional Certifications of Specialists in Human Medicine &#147;in the Name of the Nation&#148;, both in &#147;regular modality&#148; as well as in &#147;non-regular modality&#148;, can only be granted by public or private universities authorized for this mission and, besides, no other public or private institution can claim this role that corresponds exclusively for the Peruvian University.</dc:description>
