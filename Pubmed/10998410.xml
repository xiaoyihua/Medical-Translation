<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Allergy to latex has become an increasing health concern, and a potential cause for severe clinical conditions. Certain well defined risk groups have been recognized as having increased risk for latex allergy, making this condition potentially preventable. Pediatric patients constitute an important part of those risk groups. OBJECTIVES Contributing to the knowledge of the hypersensitivity to latex among pediatricians. METHODS We present four cases of pediatric patients seen in a primary care context. A brief review of the matter is added. RESULTS Features common to the four patients are underlined: high incidence of the condition, being included in a known risk group, cross-reaction with other allergens, and diagnosis suspected in the primary care consultation. CONCLUSIONS Latex constitutes an important cause of hypersensitivity reactions, specially among certain well established risk groups. Pediatricians need to have an accurate knowledge of this condition, in order to contribute to its prevention</dc:description>
