<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Neurologic involvement is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with endocarditis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the most relevant clinical, epidemiologic and evolutive characteristics of patients presenting neurologic complications during the evolution of endocarditis. METHODS Fifty adult non intravenous drug addict patients who had neurologic complications during endocarditis were prospectively evaluated. The presence of cerebral ischemia, hemorrhage, or infectious complications were studied by established criteria. RESULTS Neurologic complications were detected in 50 of the 282 patients (18%) with endocarditis diagnosed over 17 years in one institution. The most common complications were seen in patients with mitral endocarditis of either native valves (28%) or prosthetic valves (30%). The prevalence was identical in the endocarditis of either type of valve (18%). The most frequent complication was cerebral ischemia (29 episodes) and central nervous system infection (8 episodes). Fifty-nine percent of the complications presented prior to the diagnosis of endocarditis with half of the remaining 41% occurring during the first 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment. Endocarditis by Staphylococcus aureus was associated with neurologic complications in 40% of the cases. Global mortality was 48%, being related with prosthetic endocarditis, the existence of cerebral hemorrhage or central nervous system infection, etiology by S. aureus and the presence of anticoagulant treatment. CONCLUSIONS Neurologic complications are frequent during the evolution of infectious endocarditis, both or an initial feature and during its evolution. The presence of complications considerably impairs the prognosis of this disease.</dc:description>
