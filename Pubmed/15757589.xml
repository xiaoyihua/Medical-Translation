<dc:description xml:lang="en">Species of the genus Rickettsia are small, obligate intracelular, gramnegative bacteria, many of which are considered nowadays a paradigm of emergent pathogens. With the exception of R. prowazekii, they are maintained in the natural environment through a cycle involving different hosts (mainly mammals), and arthropod vectors (in general ticks, and fleas); humans are affected only by incidental transmission due to arthropod bites. The common pathogenesis of these diseases lie on the predominantly infection of endotelial cells, that determines the development of multisistemic small vessel vasculitis, which may affect lungs (interstitial pneumonitis), heart (miopericarditis), skin (rash), central nervous system (meningoencephalitis), as well as liver, and kidneys. They are classified in two groups: spotted-fever group, and typhus group rickettsia. In Spain the most prevalent rickettsioses of both groups are mediterranean spotted fever (caused by R. conorii), and murine typhus (caused by R. typhi), respectively. This review focuses mainly in these two diseases, and also in other rickettsioses of interest due to their recently emergence or reemergence (R. slovaca, R. africae, R. prowazekii, R. felis), or to their high incidence in other areas (R. rickettsii, Orientia tsutsugamushi).</dc:description>
