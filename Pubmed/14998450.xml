<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE More information is needed on hypertension control in clinical practice, which includes taking at least two blood pressure (BP) readings and taking into account surgery times and previous antihypertensive drug intake. Our study aimed to assess the optimum degree of BP control in a broad sample of Spanish hypertensive patients in primary care and to determine factors associated with a poor control. PATIENTS AND METHOD Cross-sectional, multicenter study of hypertensive patients aged over 18 years and treated with drugs during the preceeding three months, who were recruited by general practitioners through consecutive sampling in primary care settings throughout Spain over 3 consecutive days. BP measurements were performed in surgery hours (morning and evening) following standardized methods and averaging two consecutive readings. An average BP lower than 140/90 mm Hg (values lower than 130/85 mm Hg in diabetics) was regarded as optimum BP control. RESULTS 12 754 patients were included, mean age 63.3 years (10.8), 57.2% women. 36.1% (95% CI, 35.2-36.9) had good systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) controls, 39.1% (95% CI, 38.3-40.0) had good SBP control only, and 73.1% (95% CI, 72.3-73.9) had good DBP control only. BP control was significantly (*2, p &lt; 0.001) better during evening than during morning measurements (43.6% vs 37.1%) and in patients who had taken antihypertensive treatment before measurement (37.2%) vs. those who had not taken it (21.0%). Factors such as alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle, obesity and age were all associated with poor BP control (Wald's (chi 2, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The results of the PRESCAP 2002 study indicate that approximately 4 out of 10 hypertensive patients treated pharmacologically by primary health care centers in Spain have optimal BP control. Significant differences were found in the degree of control depending on surgery hours and the previous intake of antihypertensive medication.</dc:description>
