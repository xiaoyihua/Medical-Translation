<dc:description xml:lang="en">Echinococcosis is an endemic zoonosis in the south of Chile, so we have the opportunity to treat many patients especially the liver location which is the most common situation of this disease. Hepatic hydatid cyst presents its own morbidity and mortality due its complications and associated with surgical procedures. Morbidity has rates between 11 and 86% and is related with previous surgical interventions, cysts complications, the necessity of perform additional procedures during surgery and the treatment of other disease locations. Mortality by otherwise has rates below 5%. But both, morbidity and mortality persist high in spite of technological advances and therapeutical improvement. The surgical treatment of hepatic hydatidosis can be divided in four phases: surgical area isolation, cysts evacuation, treatment of cyst complications (biliary tract rupture, hepatothoracic transit, etc.), and residual cavity treatment. For each one exist different alternatives. On the other hand, hydatid cyst surgery can be classified in conservative and resective procedures. In the first group we consider marsupialization, cystostomy, Knowsly or Posadas operation and cystojejunostomy. In the resective group we include pericystectomy, partial or subtotal cystectomy and the different types of hepatectomies. Finally, some other surgical procedures are under evaluation. These include the laparoscopic approach of liver echinoccosis with few studies in the field, but with hopeful results.</dc:description>
