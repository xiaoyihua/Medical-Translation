<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND There are few instruments that evaluate the quality of food of elderly (ED) in the community. OBJECTIVE To carry out the content validity of the survey designed to determine the Food Quality Survey of Elderly (FQSE). MATERIAL AND METHODS Based on the existing literature, a questionnaire was designed to evaluate the FQSE. Content validity was performed using the Content Validity Index through the calculation of the Content Validity Ratio of Lawshe. Twenty-eight experts participated in the validation process. Subsequently, the validated survey was applied to ED. RESULTS Twenty-three questions were validated in content, distributed in the 2 subscales of the instrument. The first 15 questions subscale Healthy eating habits and 8 questions subscale Unhealthy eating habits. The Content Validity Index was 0.85. Four hundred and fifty-eight ED were surveyed. In the subscale of Healthy eating habits, 11.2% of men and 11.4% of women presented healthy eating habits; 54.4% of men and 42.9% of women presented unhealthy eating habits. Finally, in the sum of both scales, only 16.6% of men and 17.6% of women categorize within Good Food Quality. CONCLUSION The FQSE survey is a valid instrument in content and easy to apply to EL and allows evaluating and characterizing the quality of the diet of this age group.</dc:description>
