<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES To report the findings of the Spanish Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator Registry for 2016 compiled by the Electrophysiology and Arrhythmias Section of the Spanish Society of Cardiology. METHODS Prospective data were voluntarily recorded on a data collection form and send to the Spanish Society of Cardiology by each implantation team. RESULTS Overall, 5673 device implantations were reported, representing 85% of the estimated total number of implantations. The reported implantation rate was 122 per million population and the estimated total implantation rate was 143 per million. The proportion of first implantations was 66.8%. Data were received from 177 hospitals (8 more than in 2015). Most implantable cardioverter-defibrillator recipients were men (81.9%). The mean age was 62.7 ± 13.4 years. Most patients had severe or moderate-to-severe ventricular dysfunction and were in New York Heart Association functional class II. The most frequent underlying cardiac condition was ischemic heart disease, followed by dilated cardiomyopathy. Indications for primary prevention accounted for 62% of first implantations. Overall, 81.2% of devices were implanted by cardiac electrophysiologists. CONCLUSIONS The 2016 Spanish Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator Registry includes information on 85% of the devices implanted in Spain. The total number of device implantations increased in comparison with the last few years. The percentage of implantations for primary prevention also increased in comparison with the previous year.</dc:description>
