<dc:description xml:lang="en">The study of a dependency to age has generated different research and investigation which have very different but necessary viewpoints, since an aging dependency requires a multidisciplinary collaboration and awareness. The studies summarized here were carried out between the years 2000 and 2004; they demonstrate aspects which the future law on dependency should bear in mind. At the present time, a panel of experts has been formed which is drawing up draft of that law. Another one of the topics dealt with is the heterogeneity of the norms applied by social services in the different autonomous communities which are the ones which must respond to the dependency to age, providing knowledge and treatment of this dependency.</dc:description>
