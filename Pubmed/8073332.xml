<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of feeding patterns among infants born in four community hospitals of the city of Tijuana, Mexico. From a total of 1964 live births, a random sample of 236 was chosen from the clinical files and distributed according to the total number of births in each hospital. 182 mothers from the original sample were contacted and accepted to participate in the study: 61 in the three-month group, 60 in the six-month group, and 61 in the twelve-month group. The most usual feeding patterns were: at three months of age, breast milk plus formula; at six months, formula plus other foods; and, at twelve months, fresh milk plus other foods. Three infants (1.65%) were never breastfed; at three months of age, 43 per cent of the infants were not receiving their mother's milk; and, at six months of age, 90 per cent were dependent on formula and other food only. Furthermore, 20.4 per cent of the infants were weaned before reaching their first month of age; 61.3 per cent between 30 and 119 days of age, 16.8 per cent between 120 and 209 days of age, and the rest after 209 days of age. It may be concluded that infants born in community hospitals in Tijuana show tendencies in feeding patterns similar to those of Mexican-American infants and those of urban regions in developing countries; that is, the substitution of breastfeeding for formula, and early weaning.</dc:description>
