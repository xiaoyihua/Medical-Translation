<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are not frequent in neonates, but presents high morbidity and mortality. In 2008, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced in the childhood vaccination schedule and then replaced by 13-valent PCV in 2010. First dose is given at 2 months of age. Protection of neonates is expected with universal vaccination. OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical presentation, microbiology and outcome of neonates with pneumococcal invasive infections (PII) detected in two hospitals in Uruguay in 2001-2007 (pre-vaccination), 2008 (intervention) and 2009-2013 (post-vaccination). METHODS A descriptive, retrospective study was done at Pereira Rossell Hospital and Paysandú Hospital. All isolates of S. pneumoniae obtained from normally sterile fluids were included. Data were obtained from the clinical records and the microbiology laboratory. A statistical analysis with absolute frequencies, relative, rates and relative risk was performed. RESULTS 25 neonates were enrolled with diagnosis of: sepsis (n = 13), meningitis (n = 9), bacteremia (n = 1), pneumonia with empyema (n = 1) and pneumonia (n = 1). The incidence of PII in the prevaccination period was 19/25, with a rate of 0.30/1,000 births, compared to post-vaccination rate of 0.04/1,000. The relative risk was 5.9. 6/20 (30%) cases of death were reported (meningitis n = 3; sepsis n = 2; empyema n = 1). Most common serotypes were 5 and 1 (14/25) and 24/25 strains were susceptible to penicillin. DISCUSSION The symptoms were indistinguishable to infections caused by other pathogens. PII cases decreased and no deaths occurred in the post-vaccination period. No increase in non-vaccine serotypes was observed.</dc:description>
