<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Most mortality in developed countries is attributable to chronic non transmittable diseases, many of which are theoretically susceptible to prevention. The tendency of mortality by the principal chronic diseases in Spain is reviewed with different prevention strategies of the same being discussed. METHODS The 9 chronic diseases which presented the highest mortality rate in Spain in 1988 are included. The rates of mortality, adjusted by age/year in males and females was calculated from the data of deaths by age, sex and cause of death from death statistics. Moreover, the percentage of the mean annual change of these during the periods 1975-1981 and 1982-1988 have also been calculated. RESULTS Except for mortality by malignant tumor of the colon and rectum, malignant lung tumor in males and malignant breast tumors in women, which had an increase, the remaining diseases in the adjusted mortality rate by age decreased between 1975-1988. CONCLUSIONS Among the diseases in which the rate of mortality has increased there is only that of malignant lung tumors for which one factor has consistently been identified as responsible for this increase, that being smoking. The possible influence of the control of arterial hypertension in the decrease in mortality of cerebrovascular disease must be emphasized. Moreover, the impact which the ninth review of the International Disease Classification had in the reduction in mortality by chronic bronchitis, emphysema and asthma must also be pointed out.</dc:description>
