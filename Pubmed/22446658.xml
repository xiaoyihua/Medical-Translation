<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Salmonella can be isolated from the feces of seagulls. Therefore these birds can be a vector for dissemination of this pathogen. AIM To evaluate the possible role of gulls as vectors of two important human and animal pathogens (My-cobacteria and Salmonella). MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred twenty three Kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) and 60 Franklin gulls (Leucophaeus pipixcan) captured off the coast of the seaport of Talcahuano, were analyzed. Using traditional microbiological methods, the presence of Mycobacteria in cloacal swabs and feet lavages, was analyzed in both types of gulls. To detect the presence of Salmonella, feces, fecal and tracheal swabs, and feet lavage were analyzed from Franklin gulls. Feces, feet lavage, intestine, spleen, liver, kidney and lung, were examined in Kelp gulls. RESULTS All Mycobacteria cultures were negative. Salmonella enterica cultures were positive in 25 % of Kelp gulls and 6.7 % of Franklin gulls. Four serovars were identified by serotyping. Enteritidis and Senfteberg serovars were found in both types of gulls. Anatum and Infantis serovars were found only in Kelp gulls. Feces of gulls captured during the winter had the highest yield of positive cultures (36.1%). CONCLUSIONS Seagulls are an important Salmonella vector in Chile.</dc:description>
