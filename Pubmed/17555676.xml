<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Nonmelanoma skin cancer is the most prevalent and incident tumor in the world, being sun exposure the most important risk factor. Childhood and adolescence are the periods where sun exposure is greatest. An intervention to modify sun-related behaviours is essential for skin cancer prophylaxis. MATERIAL AND METHODS We carried out a quasi-experimental study on a school population of Granada with ages ranging from 11-12 years. The control and study groups completed a questionnaire prior to the intervention with educational program and thereafter. We performed a random conglomerate sampling of 628 teenagers. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Mc Nemar and Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS After the intervention, the study group showed marked improvement in the results concerning knowledge about sun exposure and skin (OR = 2.89), sun exposure and environment (OR = 2.23), and sun exposure and health (OR = 1.4) as well as in attitudes and healthy behaviour regarding sun exposure (OR = 4.2). This difference was statistically significant compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS 1. Before planning a campaign for primary prophylaxis of skin cancer it is necessary to know the information and knowledge of the target population. 2. The risk of acute, intermittent sun exposure and the use of different means of photoprotection should be stressed. 3. In our study group the rate of sun burn has decreased.</dc:description>
