<dc:description xml:lang="en">To study the importance of measuring coronary flow reserve immediately after coronary angioplasty we have analysed the results obtained after 28 angioplasties performed in 21 patients. Coronary flow reserve was measured with a 3F intracoronary catheter selectively placed in the dilated artery. Corresponding coronary angiography was analysed with an automatic edge detection program (ARTREK) and visual estimation. Coronary flow reserve increased in 26/27 cases after angioplasty from 2.4 +/- 1.3 to 4.1 +/- 2.7 (p less than 0.001). A correlation was found between minimal luminal area and minimal luminal diameter after coronary angioplasty, and coronary flow reserve (r = 0.46; p less than 0.05 and r = 0.47; p less than 0.05, respectively). The finding of a normal coronary flow reserve (greater than or equal to 3.5), had a 100% specificity but only 56% sensitivity to detect angiographic success (residual stenosis less than 50%). However 47% of patients with angiographic success did not reach normal values of coronary flow reserve. Visual estimation of the stenosis had a good correlation with automatic evaluation but significant scattering was observed at visual levels less than or equal to 25%. Visual assessment underestimated residual stenosis in all but one of the procedures. We conclude that coronary flow reserve is a potentially useful index for assessing the results after angioplasty that may complement coronary angiography. Nonetheless substantial differences between both methods exist in a significant number of cases. The relative merits of both methods, as well as the particular circumstances in which coronary flow reserve should be used, require further studies.</dc:description>
