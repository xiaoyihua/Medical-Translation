<dc:description xml:lang="en">An analytical method of histologic imaging of the gastric mucosa by computerized densitometry based on the extraction of components of an image on the basis of its luminous density is described. A group of 10 healthy controls, a group of 10 subjects with gastric ulcer and 10 with duodenal ulcer were included in the study. The method was particularly useful in the identification of atrophic and hypertrophic processes. A decrease was found in the density of parietal and chief cells in atrophic gastritis of the gastric body. In atrophic gastritis of the gastric antrum a decrease was observed in global cell density of the antrum. Patients with gastric ulcer did not present variations versus the control group. In those with duodenal ulcers an increase was observed in the density of surface cell of the gastric body with no variation in the density of parietal and principal cells. This finding challenges the classical concept on the increase in parietal cell mass accompanying duodenal ulcers.</dc:description>
