<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND A study is made of the comorbidity, observed in the clinical practice in public mental health centres, between the disorders caused by the use of alcohol and those caused by gaming. METHODS A sample of 132 patients who showed a diagnosis of "Alcohol dependence syndrome", receiving treatment in the mental health centres of the Autonomous Community of Navarra was studied. Once the diagnosis of Alcohol Dependence Syndrome was confirmed, the "South Oaks Gambling Screen" was employed in Spanish validated version. RESULTS 23.5% of the patients studied, with confirmed alcohol dependence, achieved scores within the range indicating "Probable problem player" (5.3%) and "Probable pathological player" (18.2%). The association was confirmed between problems of gambling and civil status. Separated and divorced persons and widows showed more problems with gaming. CONCLUSIONS Almost a quarter of the patients who showed "Alcohol dependence syndrome" have, or have had problems with gaming. It is important to bear this reality in mind, as well as the possible presence of other associations, when dealing with the problem of alcohol (from prevention, through evaluation and up to treatment).</dc:description>
