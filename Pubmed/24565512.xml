<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the correlations between PADUA and RENAL scores, WIT and postoperative complications in a cohort of patients who underwent elective open or minimally invasive nephron sparing surgery for renal cell carcinoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed 96 consecutive patients who underwent partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma between 2004 and 2013 at our Institution. The Spearman test was used to compare categorical variables. For all statistical analyses, a two-sided P &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The median (IQR) PADUA score was 7 (7-8) and the median (IQR) RENAL score was 7 (6-8). The median (IQR) warm ischemia time was 14 min (8-20). Low grade and high grade postoperative complications were found in 27 (28.1%) and 6 (6.3%) patients, respectively. PADUA risk group categories significantly correlated with WIT &gt; 20 minutes and high grade postoperative complications, respectively (P = .04), regardless of the surgical approach. RENAL risk group categories significantly predicted longer hilar clamping time in our cohort (P = .04), but no statistically significant correlations with high grade postoperative complications were found. CONCLUSIONS In our retrospective series nephrometric scores demonstrated to significantly predict longer warm ischemia time and higher postoperative complications, especially in those patients with more challenging and complex renal tumors. Therefore, when planning to perform partial nephrectomy, urologists should widely use these comprehensive tools.</dc:description>
