<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dikaryotic strains of Neolentinus suffrutescens were obtained from crosses of 12 monosporous isolates. The monosporous breeding stocks and the crosses were evaluated on potato dextrose agar with a wood infusion of Pinus montezumae and growth rates at 12 days of incubation were determined. Eight crosses were selected and subsequently evaluated in vitro on Pinus spp. and P. montezumae wood chips. Crosses were not equal in performance to the original parental strain, however, on Pinus spp. wood, three of the crosses exceeded performance of the original parental strain. The parental strain and the selected crosses were cultivated in a pilot plant on the above mentioned substrates. The biological efficiency (BE) fluctuated between 4.85 to 14.60 % and the production rate (TP) between 0.07 to 0.19 % on the substrate I and on the substrate II, of 4.41 to 14.92 % and of 0.06 to 0.23 %, respectively.</dc:description>
