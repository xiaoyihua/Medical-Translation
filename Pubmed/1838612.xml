<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to study the relationship between tensional response of an hypertensive patient to exercise and its cardiac repercussions, we have studied 42 essential hypertensive patients using echocardiography type M and 2D and exercise test. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had (GI) or not (GII) left ventricular hypertrophy. LVH was defined calculating left ventricular mass (LVM) or mean wall thickness (MWT). We have found significant correlations between tensional response and LVH, using only MWT as the index of LVH. This correlation was significant not only with maximum systolic arterial pressure but also with systolic arterial pressure in all intermediate charge stages. Evolution time of arterial hypertension significantly correlated with the degree of LVH according to MWT and less significantly with LVM. We conclude that the correlation between tensional response to exercise and cardiac hypertrophy is always higher when considering MWT as the index of LVH since the calculating the mass some other parameters are also present which hinder its significance and that correlation is established not only in the maximum exercise level.</dc:description>
