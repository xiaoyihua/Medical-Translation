<dc:description xml:lang="en">During the XVII Central American and Caribbean Sports Games held in Ponce in 1993 the health services offered to the Puerto Rico Delegation included medical, dental and psychological assistance, physical therapy and services on the playing field. Information about the use of these services was obtained from the encounter sheets. The Puerto Rican delegation of 750 members had 1,800 encounters with the health team; 612 (34.0%) individual consults; 896 (54.8%) physical therapy sessions; 166 (9.2%) encounters in the sports venues; and 36 (20%) group therapies. The most common diagnoses were athletic injuries (304; 58.2%) and diseases of the respiratory system (76; 14.5%). The most frequent athletic injuries were first degree strains (75; 24.7%) and tendinitis (73, 24.0%). This pattern is similar to that observed in other sports games and delegations with mild conditions prevailing. An interdisciplinary work and biopsychosocial approach will be important for the better health and performance of our athletes.</dc:description>
