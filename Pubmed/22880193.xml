<dc:description xml:lang="en">The paths of mental health and psychoanalysis diverge. The path of mental health is to frame hu-man behavior into "normality". It is in the idea of "public order" and in "the correct way" where is to be found. The second is concerned with the particularity of each subject and, finally, with its singularity. The "sinthome" is the key to this difference. The "sinthome" can be understood as a dysfunction which is to be corrected to reestablish the submission to the norm or as a "truth" to be revealed as the way to the most singular of each subject. It is in this point where we will find a cer-tainty of being "beyond neurosis" which will orientate each individual in the way of dignity, which is not necessarily that of wellbeing.</dc:description>
