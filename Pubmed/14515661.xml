<dc:description xml:lang="en">Invasive carcinoma found after simple hysterectomy for several causes is an increasing clinical condition. That situation results in the necessity for further therapy: re-operation or radiotherapy. The purpose of this review is to analyze our results with postoperative radiotherapy for these patients. In 1998, 59 patients were submitted to postoperative radiotherapy at the Oncology Hospital, Medical Cancer Center for invasive cervical cancer found after simple hysterectomy for several causes. All patients had postoperative radiotherapy, the dose depended of the magnitude of residual disease after surgery (range 10-80 Gy). After surgery 27 patients had gross residual disease; and no residual disease or microscopic disease was present in 32 patients. Three years overall survival rate was 59% for the whole group. With the results of the univariate analysis, prognostic factors found that significantly affect disease free survival were interval between hysterectomy and radiotherapy of more than 6 months, radiotherapy dose less than 50 Grays and histology. With multivariate analysis only presence of gross residual disease affect significantly disease free survival p = 0.0000. Postoperative radiotherapy results in patients with invasor cervical cancer incidentally found in hysterectomy specimens with minimal residual disease are excellent. However with the presence of more extensive residual disease the results in disease free survival are worse than those obtained in patients with similar stages who had not been treated with hysterectomy. A well established diagnostic procedure must be done in all patients candidates to simple hysterectomy.</dc:description>
