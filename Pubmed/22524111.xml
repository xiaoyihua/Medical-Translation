<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ca2+ is a second messenger which regulates many functions directly related with cancer such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+],) is finely regulated by several mechanisms, among them ionic channels, the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), the plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA) and the mitochondrial Ca2+ transport. In cancer, the tumour cell proliferates without control since the capacity to recognize apoptotic signals has been lost. The apoptosis is regulated by changes in several proteins, as caspases and the Bcl-2 family members, among others. Additionally, the "reticulum stress", promoted by the accumulation and aggregation of unfolded proteins in the interior of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ussually leads to apoptosis. The "reticulum stress" can be induced by several agents, remarkably with thapsigargin, a selective inhibitor of the SERCA, which in turn induces a large increment in [Ca2+],, leading to apoptosis. As a consequence, currently, derivatives of thapsigargin are successfully been assayed as anti-neoplastic agents. Ca2+ is then transferred to the mitochondria, where it is known to constitute a main apoptotic signal. On the other hand, several sphingolipids, such as ceramide and sphingosine, and their phosphorylated derivatives ceramide-1-phosphate and sphingosine-1-phosphate, directly involved in the [Ca2+]1 regulation, are also recognized as signal messengers related with cancer processes. In this review we discuss new evidences on the effect of several sphingolipids in the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and its relationship with apoptosis and cancer.</dc:description>
