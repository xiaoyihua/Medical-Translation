<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION We compare hospitalisation rates for acute respiratory tract infection in children younger than 24 months with significant congenital heart disease without Down's syndrome with those with Down's syndrome with or without congenital heart disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was an epidemiological, multicentre (53 Spanish hospitals), observational and prospective study, from October 2006 to April 2007. A total of 1085 patients were followed-up, of which 806 did not have Down's syndrome and 279 with Down's syndrome: 135 with significant, 38 with non significant and 105 without congenital heart disease. RESULTS A total of 147 patients (13.1%; 95% CI, 11.2-15.2%) required hospitalisation due to respiratory infection. Rates in patients without and with Down's syndrome were 11% vs 19.1%. In the Down's group, 26.3% had no significant, a 23% had significant and 11.4% had no congenital heart disease. The main diagnosis was bronchiolitis (59.4%). An infectious agent was found in 36.2% cases. The specific admission rate due to respiratory syncytial virus was 4.4%, with differences in children without vs with Down's syndrome (3.2% vs 7.8%). In the Down's patients we found rates of 15.8%, 9.3% and 3% in the non-significant, significant and no congenital heart disease. Immunoprophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus rates were 83.4% vs 39.9% in no Down's versus Down's syndrome patients. No differences were found in hospital stay or the severity. CONCLUSIONS Hospital admission rates due to respiratory infection, and specifically respiratory syncytial virus, were higher in the Down's patients, particularly in the group with no significant congenital heart disease and low immunoprophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus.</dc:description>
