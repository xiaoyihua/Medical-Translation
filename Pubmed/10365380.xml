<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in blood pressure (BP) regulation. A number of RAS polymorphisms have been linked to essential hypertension (EH), but there is uncertainty about this association in other studies. We examined whether the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene, and the M235T and T174M polymorphisms of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene are associated with EH in a Spanish sample of hypertensive patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied 75 patients with EH (BP &gt; 160/100 mmHg), aged 55 (8.5) years, 30 males, systolic BP (SBP) 182 +/- (22.1) mmHg, diastolic BP (DBP) 109 +/- (9.9) mmHg (mean [SD]) and a strong family history of the disease. As a control group, 75 healthy subjects with no family history of cardiovascular disease were studied. The polymorphisms were determined by PCR amplification of genomic DNA, followed by enzyme digestion for the AGT gene polymorphisms. RESULTS The genotype distribution and the frequencies of the alleles of the three RAS polymorphisms were similar in hypertensive and control subjects. In addition, we did not find any compound effect of the I/D ACE gene and M235T AGT gene polymorphisms on BP levels in hypertensive and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS In this sample, the contribution of the ACE I/D polymorphism and the AGT M235T and T174M polymorphisms in the development of EH seems to be less important than previously estimated.</dc:description>
