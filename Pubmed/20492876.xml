<dc:description xml:lang="en">Systemic treatment for psoriasis has radically changed since the emergence of new biological therapies. One of these biological agents is etanercept. Until recently, the use of etanercept for treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis in Spain was only approved in an intermittent way or in cycles of treatment (not exceeding 24 weeks). However, from September 2009, its administration has been also approved in a continuous way for patients who require it. This decision is based on the results of several studies that evaluate the efficacy and safety of etanercept administrated in short and long term and in a continuous or intermittent therapy. One of these studies is Crystel study, what evaluates the efficacy and safety of continuous and paused etanercept regimens in psoriasis patients for 54-week-period. Crystel study results showed that both continuous and paused etanercept therapies improved PGA and PASI scores and patient satisfaction rates, no unexpected adverse effects were observed. Therefore, doctors may use one treatment or another according to patients needs.</dc:description>
