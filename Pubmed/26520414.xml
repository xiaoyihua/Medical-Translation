<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To examine the use of analgesics, from the perspective of the pharmacist community, and pharmaceutical practice in mild-moderate pain. DESIGN A cross-sectional, observational study was performed between April and September 2013. SETTING 696 community pharmacies in 20 Spanish provinces. PARTICIPANTS Community pharmacists with a minimum professional experience of one year. MAIN MEASUREMENTS Characterisation of the demand for analgesics, analgesic users, and pharmaceutical intervention for mild-moderate pain from the perspective of the pharmaceutical community. RESULTS The main reason why a patient with mild-moderate pain visits a pharmacy is to receive a drug with prescription (45.5%), and the most common condition is headache (35.2%). Ibuprofen and paracetamol are the most commonly used drugs for mild-moderate pain. More than one-third (38.9%) of pharmacists follow a protocol for counselling. A correlation was found between the pharmacist's professional experience and the application of counselling process (Fisher P&lt;.05). Some 87.8% of pharmacists checked two indicators from the dispensing service, and only 1.3% did not check any. Referral to a physician was made by 14.8% of pharmacists, with the main reason being the detection of alarm indicators. CONCLUSIONS Protocols need to be designed and adapted to the characteristics of the 3 profiles identified, in order to increase the efficiency of pharmaceutical services in mild-moderate pain relief. Practical and specific training in pain are required to implement services to ensure the correct and systemic use of analgesics and positive clinical outcomes.</dc:description>
