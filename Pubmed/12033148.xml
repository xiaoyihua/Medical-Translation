<dc:description xml:lang="en">It constitutes a descriptive, retrospective study whose aim is to come to know the number and traits of the patients demanding post-coital interception at the Severo Ochoa Hospital in Leganés. We consider the patient's age and place of origin as well as the precise day of the week in which the consultation takes place. Likewise, we take account of the number of women that reiterated their demands during this period. We compare the resultant information with the voluntary interruptions of pregnancy carried out at this hospital in order to approach an assessment of the method's effectiveness. We pose the question of whether the post-coital interception is really a gynaecological emergency or, rather, it could be administered as part of the Primary Health Care services and, even, as other studies suggest, without medical prescription.</dc:description>
