<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To assess the utility of salivary gland scintigraphy and salivary flow to quantify salivary function and to evaluate the usefulness of pilocarpine in the treatment of radiation-induced xerestomia in head and neck cancer patients. METHOD Thirty two patients with head and neck tumor treated with radiotherapy (RDT) were studied. Patients were classified into two groups: pilocarpine group (P), that received prophylactic pilocarpine before RDT and during the first year after treatment. No pilocarpine group (NP) that received RDT without pilocarpine. Salivary gland scintigraphy and salivary flow were performed before RDT and during one year after treatment. Parotid and submaxillary uptake and excretion were calculated. Salivary flow after stimulation during five minutes was also obtained. RESULTS Uptake and excretion in both salivary glands decreased after RDT. There were no statistical differences comparing P and NP groups (p &lt; 0.001). However, in group P a trend to recovery was observed in parotid uptake values at 12 months after treatment, but it was not statistically significant. In both groups the salivary flow decreased after RDT and a good correlation (r = 0.8) between salivary flow and submaxillary excretion and parotid excretion was found. CONCLUSIONS Salivary gland scintigraphy and salivary flow could be useful to evaluate salivary gland function in patients with head and neck irradiated tumors. Although better results on the salivary uptake at 12 months were noted, pilocarpine did not significantly improve salivary gland function.</dc:description>
