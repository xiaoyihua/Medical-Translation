<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Status epilepticus (SE) is a condition in which epileptic discharges are sufficiently prolonged or repeated so as to cause persistent changes in neurological function. DEVELOPMENT At the present time the classification of SE seems to be incomplete and therefore provisional. However the broad subdivision into convulsive SE and non-convulsive SE is still useful in clinical practice when emergency treatment is required. The neuropathological changes are largely determined by the nature (excitory or inhibitory) and the duration of the event which originated the crisis. Tonic-clonic SE is only one of many variants of SE. However, unlike many others, it is a medical emergency which if not suitably treated may lead to permanent neurological damage. Neurone damage and death are the result of a series of parallel processes occurring at a systemic and neuronal level. Outstanding amongst the latter is the activation of a complex neurotoxic cascade. Better understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms occurring in SE would set the stage for a more logical use of treatment. CONCLUSIONS With advances in the treatment of SE in recent years the prognosis of these patients has improved considerably. However, we should now consider the use of conventional anticonvulsant drugs alone to be insufficient, and that this should give way to polytherapy with neuroprotector agents.</dc:description>
