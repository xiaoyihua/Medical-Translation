<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The evaluation of the presence of parasites in semisolid and liquid sewage in Argentinian Patagonia in view of the fact that this is a restriction for its use. METHODS The samples taken at 4 Domestic Sewage Plants were analyzed in accordance with Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, Environmental Protection Agency, World Health Organization and some other classifications. RESULTS Only 2 of 6 semisolid samples analyzed had non-viable Ascaris lumbricoides eggs. Of the 10 liquid samples analyzed, only 2 did not contain eggs whereas the remaining ones had pathogens of categories I (Giardia sp., Hymenolepis nana and Enterobius vermicularis) and III (Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale and Trichuris trichiura). CONCLUSIONS All semisolid samples turned out to be satisfactory for use as fertilizer as no viable Ascaris lumbricoides eggs were found in any of them. But only 6 of the liquid samples were satisfactory for use as they had no eggs or their concentrations was equal to or less than 1 egg per litre.</dc:description>
