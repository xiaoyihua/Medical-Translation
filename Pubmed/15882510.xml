<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The progressive accumulation of iron in the organism contribute to one of the most important problems of morbidity and mortality in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We present an observational protocol, multicentre, open and non-aleatheorised, in patients diagnosed with MDS on transfusional regime with iron overload. The study was meant to prove the effectiveness of the parenteral treatment with desferrioxamine using continuous devices of subcutaneous profusion and evaluate the evolution of iron overload as well as transfusional requirements. PATIENTS AND METHOD There were 28 patients (12 men and 16 women), 12 AR, 15 AS and 1 unknown. Average monitoring lasted 13.5 months and there was a gradual loss of patients. 11 of them had gone during the first year. RESULTS After 12 months the average of ferritin decreased by 258.51 ng/dl (DE 1208.04; p = 9.4) and after 24 months, it decreased by 979.6 ng/dl (DE 810.31; p = 0.1). After 12 months the average of requirements increased by 60.57 gHb/month (DE 183.7; p = 0.029) and after 24 months, it increased by 167.3 g/Hb/month (DE 406.5; p = 0.36). CONCLUSIONS Desferroxiamine treatment is effective at least to prevent an iron overload in these patients, and therefore should be incorporated in the clinical practice.</dc:description>
