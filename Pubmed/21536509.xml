<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Bladder catheterization (BC) is frequently performed to diagnose urinary tract infection (UTI) (the most common serious bacterial infection among young children). The purposes of this study were to evaluate performance and complications of BC to obtain a urine specimen. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a prospective study conducted in an urban children's hospital on patients who had a urine specimen obtained in the emergency department (ED) by BC between November 1, 2009 and December 15, 2009. Epidemiological data and the medical reasons why the BC was performed were reviewed. Finally, to determine the complications we contacted the family by telephone at least one month after the BC. RESULTS A total of 126 BC were performed in 124 patients, 45 males (35.7%) and 81 female (64.3%). A urine sample was obtained in all cases. The median age was 7 months (5 days-35 months). Of the 126 urine cultures collected, 34 were positive (26.98%) and 1 was considered contaminated (0.8%). Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (27, 79.41%). Fever (76.2%) was the main reason why BC was performed in children. Of the 116 patients contacted by telephone, only 5 mentioned complications: genital pain (3), unconfirmed hematuria (1) and UTI 12 days after (1). CONCLUSIONS BC performed in ED to obtain a urine sample in non toilet-trained children is effective and safe. BC is an invasive method which needs to be quality controlled.</dc:description>
