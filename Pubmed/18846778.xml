<dc:description xml:lang="en">The presence of E. coli producer of shiga toxin and rotavirus was investigated in 90 stool samples from children less than 3 years old with diarrhea. Three aliquots were separated from each sample: the first one underwent previous enrichment for E. coli O157, the second one was plated on agar MacConkey-Sorbitol and Red Eosine with MUG, and the last one was frozen at -70 degrees C for the later analysis of rotavirus. The search of the antigen O157 of E. coli was carried out by immunochromatography in vitro of Coris Bioconcept (Belgium). The presence of the antigen O157 (rbf O157) and the genes that code for the shiga toxin (stx1 and stx2) were determined by PCR. Rotavirus were detected by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. The 90 samples analyzed by immunochromatography were negative for the antigen O157. The isolates were STEC strains non O157 and contained the gene sx1, showing a 10% of positivity. The electrophoresis for the viral RNA detected rotavirus in 21 (23.33%) samples. This result confirms the rotavirus prevalence and suggests, that the circulation of STEC strains non O157 is an indication of the involvement of these strains in the ethiology of acute diarrheas.</dc:description>
