<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of this study is to describe the results of 36 patients with trigeminal neuralgia treated with microvascular decompression. METHODS Between June 2005 and May 2012, 36 patients with trigeminal neuralgia were operated by the first author (AC), underwent microvascular decompression. The age, sex, duration of symptoms before surgery, and surgical finds, were all evaluated. In addition, postoperative results were also analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-five patients were women and 11 were men. The average age of the patients was 48 years. The average time of postoperative follow-up after the surgery was 36 months. Relief from pain until now occurred in 32 patients (88%). Pain recurrence was observed in 4 patients; of those, 2 cases showed a vein compression. CONCLUSION The microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia is a safe an effective option. A vein compression could point out an unfavorable follow-up.</dc:description>
