<dc:description xml:lang="en">The data on the incidence of cancer in Navarra for the two year period 1993-94 is set out by age groups and sex, with the aim of making available the most recent information contained in the Navarra Cancer Register. The collection of data for the years 1993-94 was carried out in an active manner in the information sources of the register. The procedures of previous years regarding collection, control of duplicates and processing were maintained. Both the quality indicators and the calculations of the different rates were obtained following the recommendations proposed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). In the 1993-1994 period, 5.186 incident cases of malign tumours were registered in Navarra. Some 59% occurred in men. Excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, the crude rate of incidence was 475 in men and 319 in women; the rate adjusted to the world population was 297 per 100,000 for men and 186 per 100,000 for women. If nonmelanoma skin cancer is excluded, 55% of all of the cancer cases diagnosed during 1993-1994 in men were located in the lung, prostate, bladder, colon and stomach. In women they were located in the breast, body of the uterus, colon, lymphoid tissue and stomach, representing 56% of the total cases.</dc:description>
