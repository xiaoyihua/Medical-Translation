<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since its inception the language of humanity was spoken to communicate with those who were coming in the immediate environment. When writing appeared, there was a great evolution since the ideas could be passed at a distance, which made possible the organization of communities, cities, empires, and so on. And the development of literature, science, and the arts. The progress of humanity became more apparent with the discovery of printing and distributing books that were saved ideas, words written by different authors that could be known by reading. Another major advance came with the chance to hear the human voice, spoken language, not just those in the vicinity of the speaker itself is not remotely over the telephone, radio or television. Even it is possible to hear the words of dead people. The last and extraordinary step in spreading the language they are giving the latest computer technology over the Internet in which the possibilities of information and collection of written ideas are virtually endless. In this situation, which has recently started not stop thinking about the danger to the book as a depository and jealous guardian of culture, art, science and history and has personally been targeted by every human being his books or his lack thereof. From the fundamental discoveries of Broca's and Wernicke, progress has been made in the brain language processing. The knowledge and measurement of brain activity in normal subjects has advanced gracais the incorporation of modern methods of diagnostic imaging: PET, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). It is expected to go much further with the application of these techniques in experimental models of various neurological diseases and more sophisticated linguistic analysis.</dc:description>
