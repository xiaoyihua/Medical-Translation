<dc:description xml:lang="en">Association of primary liver carcinoma with virus of type B hepatitis has been demonstrated around the world, especially in African and Asian countries where high titles for surface antigen of B hepatitis (HBsAg) have been found. Presence of viral markers of B hepatitis has been studied in a group of 34 patients with primary liver carcinoma, in 139 cirrhotic patients, and in 100 normal individuals. Positive titles of HBsAg or of antibodies against "core" antigen (anti-HBc) without evidence of antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs) were considered as positive markers for virus B infection. Percentages of positive markers in the series studied were as follows: 52% in the cases of primary liver carcinoma, 38% in the cirrhotic cases, and 5% in the control subjects. There is a significant difference in relation to the incidence of viral markers between patients with liver carcinoma and normal controls. A possible role of the virus of B hepatitis in the pathogenesis of primary liver carcinoma could be suggested on the basis of these results.</dc:description>
