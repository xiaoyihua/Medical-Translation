<dc:description xml:lang="en">Nowadays, most of the deaths in neonatal ages take place in neonatal intensive care units and a significative number of these are involved in decisions of withholding or withdrawing medical care. The growing complexity of the health care in neonatal settings entails that end-of-life decision-making occurs more frequently. Personal views and attitudes on the best care of the severely ill newborns can be different, since to define objectively the ″best interests″ for the infant is not easy at all. The question of how to best care for such infants is ongoing, and there remain deep divisions within the field. The aim of this issue is to review the different criteria used in the western world, Europe, especially in the Netherlands, and the EEUU and the current debate on neonatal euthanasia. Poor vital prognosis, current and future quality of life and, after the Groningen protocol, unbearable suffering are the criteria commonly used in neonatal end-of-life decisions, including euthanasia. It is necessary to distinguish the decisions, in which euthanasia is chosen, of which they are an appropriate limit of therapeutic effort.</dc:description>
