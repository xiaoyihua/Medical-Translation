<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To put forth new findings in urologic oncology with impact in the clinical practice, presented in the principal annual meetings (EAU, ESTRO, AUA, ASCO and ASTRO). METHODS The reporters of the OncoUrology Forum select and classify the summaries on genitourinary cancer based on the impact on present or future practice. This document includes the summaries having the highest scores. RESULTS The OncoUrology Forum committee considered the following messages important. The PIVOT study shows that radical prostatectomy reduces the specific mortality of prostate cancer (PCa) compared to follow-up in observation, in localized high risk PCa or PSA &gt;10 ng/mL. Dissection of the pelvic lymph nodes should be done in all the patients with bladder cancer treated by radical cystectomy, regardless of the tumor stage, in accordance with baseline analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data. An analysis of the SEER of patients with renal cancer concluded that the radical nephrectomy is associated to worse cardiovascular and overall survival compared to those treated with partial nephrectomy in localized renal cell carcinoma of ≤2 cm. In patients with nonseminomatous germ cells cancer, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection should not be omitted when the residual tumor size is ≤1 cm because of the considerably high risk of teratoma and viable cancer. CONCLUSIONS Although these studies do not offer a final response for all the oncourological subjects, these results will have an impact on the daily clinical practice.</dc:description>
