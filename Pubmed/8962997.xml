<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether hypolipaemiant treatment in patients with hypercholesterolaemia (HC) corresponds to the recommendations in a primary care diagnosis and treatment protocol. DESIGN Descriptive observational study. SETTING Primary care centre. PATIENTS 304 patients whose long-term prescription records recorded hypolipaemiant drugs. RESULTS Average age was 62.7 and 198 were women. 176 presented simple HC and 125 mixed dyslipaemia. 46 had a history of ischaemic cardiopathy. Pre-treatment LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) was recorded for 224; 168 of them had 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors. Of the 202 who had a record of post-treatment LDL-c, 163 were at level III of risk, which went down to 47 at 6 months. The values before and after medication were as follows: total cholesterol (TC) 290.3 mg/dl and 246.2 mg/dl; LDL-c 207.8 mg/dl and 166.0 mg/dl; HDL-cholesterol 50.5 mg/dl and 53.1 mg/dl; and triglycerides (TG) 156.1 mg/dl and 133.6 mg/dl. Mean reduction of TC and LDL-c was greater in the patients treated with statins that in those treated with fibrates. Decrease in TG was greater with fibrates. CONCLUSIONS Treatment was initiated when LDL-c figures were over the limit specified in the protocol. In most cases this was because of the accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors.</dc:description>
