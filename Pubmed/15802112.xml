<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To measure two functional dimensions (vitality and physical function) involved in the quality of life of the over-65s and to find what relationship they maintain with the commonest reasons for consultation. DESIGN Cross-sectional, descriptive study. SETTING Primary care. PARTICIPANTS Randomised sample of 179 patients over 65 from 14 primary care clinics in Navarra. METHODS SF-36 quality-of-life questionnaire and most common reasons for consultation. Personal and family details and ongoing drug prescription were also recorded. RESULTS The most common reasons for consultation were insomnia (31.8%), arthrosis (48%), and urinary symptoms (16.2%). The greatest differences in the SF-36 scales occurred in patients with insomnia. In the multiple regression models, inverse associations were found for each of the reasons for consultation with the vitality and physical function dimensions. Vitality was associated with urinary symptoms, with an adjusted beta coefficient of -11.2 points (95% CI, -18.6 to -3.7). Insomnia was associated with significant decline in vitality and physical function, with beta of -7.7 points (95% CI, -13.9 to -1.5) and -10.3 points (95% CI, -19.1 to -1.6), respectively. Arthrosis symptoms behaved in a similar way. CONCLUSIONS The most common pathologies or symptoms causing primary care consultations in the over-65s affect significantly the quality-of-life dimensions relating to the pursuit of normal daily life.</dc:description>
