<dc:description xml:lang="en">Sixteen Venezuelan IMF, dairy products, dry-salted fish products, meat products and vegetable products (specially fruit products) were characterized; water activity, pH, moisture, acidity and humectants were determined, allowing us to identify the main hurdles. Parallelly the microbial profile and her evolution for each IMF were established in function of time and storage conditions. This information permits us to explain the different stability compartments for our IMF; simple modifications that will increase their stability are suggested. Water activity is not enough as a hurdle if it is not accompanied by an appropriate packaging, specially in tropical countries, that would limit water migrations.</dc:description>
