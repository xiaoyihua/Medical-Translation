<dc:description xml:lang="en">Degree of mineralization of enamel is one of the parameters mediating in its resistance to acid dissolution and at the stage of teething, the enamel is immature and, therefore, present a higher susceptibility to dental caries. This investigation was carried out with 38 preschool children (means = 5.5 years) and 19 children coursing second grade (means = 7.6 years). They were treated with 10 oral rinsing with mineralizing solution in order to evaluate its effect on enamel resistance to acid dissolution; colorimetric technique was used for such purpose. A study in vitro was also performed in impacted third molars extracted by surgery and to two halves of the clinical crowns of such molars the treatment was applied; the other two halves were taken as control. Increase of enamel resistance found was 18.6% in the study of preschool children and 34.6% in the children attending to second grade school. In both groups, 89.5% of the children increased enamel resistance and in the study in vitro increaser enamel was 14.9%.. It is concluded that the use of risings with mineralizing solution at the outbreak of permanent teething increase, significatively, enamel resistance, and that at the age of seven the enamel is still immature, thus its resistance to acid dissolution can be also increased using mineralizing solution.</dc:description>
