<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse the cases of pancreatic metastases due to renal carcinoma operated on in our hospital between the years 2000 and 2011. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study using the variables of 8 patients who were subjected to surgery of pancreatic metastases due to renal carcinoma, and a comparison of our data with those from the literature. RESULTS The incidence of metastatic disease of the pancreas due to renal carcinoma in our series was 1.2%. All the metastases were metachronous, with both sexes being affected equally. The mean time between resection of the renal tumour and the diagnosis of the metastasis was 12.42 years (range: 1.62-30.13 years). The therapeutic approach to the pancreatic lesions was surgical in all cases. Seven patients are currently still alive. CONCLUSION Metastatic disease of the pancreas due to renal carcinoma is uncommon (1%-2.8%). The interval between the primary resection and the metastasis can be quite long. Pancreatic metastasis must always be suspected in patients who present with a pancreatic mass and a history of renal carcinoma. Aggressive surgical treatment is recommended in selected cases. The surgery in these cases improves survival and the quality of life.</dc:description>
