<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Evaluate if the Insurance strengthened the primary care role and enhanced healthcare access and comprehensiveness. MATERIALS AND METHODS Through a household survey (n=2 413; year 2006) we collected data on utilization of health services by under 8 year old beneficiaries from 8 municipalities. We used hypothesis tests to identify significant differences between municipal profiles of Insurance implementation and beneficiaries grouped by utilization patterns. RESULTS Although more than 95% of children received medical healthcare in each municipality (using the Insurance and other services), the Insurance utilization varied significantly by municipal profile. Access to comprehensive healthcare and consultation rates were significantly higher for those beneficiaries who used the Insurance along with other health services, compared with those who only used the Insurance services. Use of hospitals was significantly lower within Insurance users. CONCLUSION The Insurance was more effective when implemented and used in conjunction with the municipal networks of health services.</dc:description>
