<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Avascular necrosis of femoral head (AVN) has been identified as a frequent complication after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Advances in the treatment for haematological malignancies have improved survival after HSCT. The aim of this study was to report the short and medium-term results of total hip arthroplasty for the treatment of AVN. PATIENTS AND METHOD We performed 12 consecutive total hip arthroplasties (THA) with at least 2 year follow up. The diagnosis was AVN in the context of HSCT. Except for one, in all the patients THA was the first surgical procedure. RESULTS On the Merle D'Augbigne and Postel grading system, 83% hips were good or excellent. There were no revisions for septic or aseptic loosening. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that, in our experience, THA provided a good short and medium term follow up in patients with AVN after HSCT, and it seems to be a safe and effective treatment and the best option after conservative treatment failure.</dc:description>
