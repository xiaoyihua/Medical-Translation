<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The association between hyperuricemia and adverse perinatal outcome has been studied on numerous occasions, particularly in relation to hypertension and preeclampsia. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study is to analyze the predictive value of serum concentrations of uric acid during the first trimester of pregnancy for adverse perinatal outcome in women with glomerulopathies. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-five women diagnosed with glomerulonephritis at the Instituto Nacional de Perinatología were included in this study. The determination of serum uric acid concentration was made between 7 and 12 weeks of gestation. RESULTS We finding that Uric acid level in the first trimester showed a significant correlation with blood pressure in the third trimester (Spearman rho coefficient: 0.45, p = 0.04,), with weeks of gestation at birth (Spearman rho coefficient: -0.42, p 0.05), and with weight at birth (Spearman rho coefficient: -0.61 p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS The findings of our study suggest the clinical utility of determining and interpreting uric acid in the first trimester in patients with glomerulopathias and mild renal insufficiency (creatinine less than 1.4 mg/dL), and a threshold of 4.8 mg/dL to consider at which a patient can be considered at high risk of premature birth, low birth weight, and preeclampsia.</dc:description>
