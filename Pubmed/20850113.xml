<dc:description xml:lang="en">The recent publication in November 2009 of the revision of the European guidelines on hypertension management by the European Society of hypertension has aroused great interest. It has included the results of new important studies on hypertension, reinforcing the evidence on which the recommendations of the 2007 ESH/ESC guidelines were based. However, some of the recommendations that were firmly established until now are reconsidered. This dual aspect can generate some relevant doubts in clinical practice, even more so if we consider that some recommendations are opposite to other recently published guidelines. The presentation of a frequently appearing clinical case, as a hypertensive and diabetic female patient &gt;65 years old, provides us the opportunity to analyze and interpret new recommendations, in comparison to the previous ones and to establish the best clinical action approach in the daily practice. In addition to the changes in the management of diabetic patients, some especially relevant aspects of the revised guide are updated, for example, subclinical injury of the target organ and its affect on cardiovascular risk stratification, how to manage those patients with high normal blood pressure values and other cardiovascular risk factors, the "new" blood pressure goals, as well as the objectives and the treatments under specific conditions such as the elderly population and the associated cardiovascular disease.</dc:description>
