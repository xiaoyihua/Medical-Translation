<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the level of knowledge of the family physician on preventive stomatology. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cross-sectional comparative, from 1999 to 2000 with convenience sample (70 family physicians) that fulfilled the criteria of selection. With a previous informed consent, a questionnaire with two sections was applied: one of them measures sociodemographic variables; and the second one, which explores the level of knowledge on the program of preventive odontology (POP), consists of 20 questions with three options of answer. This questionnaire was validated by means of judgment of experts, and it was made to analyze the extension and the level of understanding of the questions. The statistical analysis was made with measures of central tendency and deviation for quantitative variables, percentages and proportions for qualitative variables, chi2 for differences, as well as p value and intervals of confidence to 95% for statistical significance. RESULTS Sample with an average age of 44 years old +/- 6.8; 44 of them (63%) were men, proportion of 2:1 men/1 woman; 42 of them (60%) had a good level of knowledge. 70% of the interviewed people had a specialty on Family Medicine; 19 of them (27%) practice privately; the average of labor antiquity was of 14 years +/- 5.89. There were no differences found in the level of knowledge and the fact of having a specialty on Family Medicine versus only having the Medicine degree (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Even though the level of knowledge on the Preventive Stomatology Program was average and good in a great percentage, it is necessary to make more studies on the subject, in order to establish improvement strategies.</dc:description>
