<dc:description xml:lang="en">The white wine Chacolía de Vizcaya/Bizkaiko Txakolina is characteristic from The Basque Country region and regulated under Appellation Contrôlée standards (BOPV 14/6/94). The objective of this study was the identification and selection of autochthonous yeast strains, to improve the conditions used to maintain the typical characteristics of this region wines. Yeasts identified as Saccharomyces bayanus isolated around these fields from 1996 to 1998, were subjected to a selective procedure based on enological characteristics and fermentative behaviour. Three of the selected strains were used to inoculate, at winery scale, two grape juice varieties accepted by the Appellation Contrôlée (Hondarrabi Zuri and Folle Blanche). The inoculated strains on the respective vinifications was followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism of mitochondrial DNA (REAmt) method with AluI enzyme, due to their specificity, short outcome, and technological simplicity compared with other molecular typing methods such as: chromosomal karyotyping analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism using the infrequently cutting enzyme SfiI (REA infrequent). This study demonstrated that strains with different phenotypic traits could show indistinguishable restriction patterns with REAmt, but could be discriminated using other typing methods such as RAPD-PCR, which although showing low reproducibility could be used as complementary to REAmt. Our results demonstrate that in spite of using autochthonous selected strains, the inoculation of musts with a particular strain do not guarantee its predominance and driving fermentation features. Of all yeast strains studied, strain no. 2 showed the best results in sensory testing and at the implantation process. Therefore, it could be used with commercial purposes for the production of Chacolí de Vizcaya/Bizkaiko Txakolina, especially when using musts from Folle Blanche.</dc:description>
