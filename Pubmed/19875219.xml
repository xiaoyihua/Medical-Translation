<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The aim of the study was to analyse the relationship between the intensity of the respiratory tract inflammation, expressed by oxidative stress markers, and the severity of the disease in patients with bronchiectasis unassociated with cystic fibrosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included 25 patients with stable bronchiectasis (15 females and 10 males). As determining factors of severity, the following parameters were collected: degree of dyspnoea, number of exacerbations/admissions in the last year, mean daily sputum volume, sputum colour (graduated colour scale), bacterial colonisation, respiratory function tests, quality of life (St. George questionnaire) and radiological extension of the lesions (Bhalla scale). Inflammation was analysed using the measurement of nitric oxide, pH and concentration of nitrites, nitrates and isoprostane in the exhaled air condensate. The C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also determined in peripheral blood. RESULTS There were no significant relationships between the markers in the exhaled air condensate and the clinical, radiological and functional involvement or the quality of life of the patients. Only bacterial colonisation (16 cases) was associated with higher values of nitrates in exhaled air (mean+/-standard deviation: 18+/-4 compared to 7+/-2microM; r(2)=0.6) and a higher number of exacerbations (3.1+/-1.9 compared to 1.7+/-1.9; r(2)=0.3). CONCLUSIONS In our study, the measurement of inflammation markers in exhaled air is only associated with some parameters of severity in patients with bacterial bronchiectasis.</dc:description>
