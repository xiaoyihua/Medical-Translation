<dc:description xml:lang="en">Tongue paralysis are often underestimated, particularly when isolated or having a chronic course. Sometimes, its early recognition may lead to the diagnosis of a tumor process, favorably modifying its course. We have retrospectively analyzed 13 cases of tongue paralysis of neoplastic etiology. In a woman, the paralysis was due to a lesion of the corticobulbar pathway whereas in the remaining 12, the alteration occurred in the hypoglossal nerve, particularly at extrabulbar intracranial and cranial base tract (10 cases). The clinical picture was due to the primary tumor in 9 patients, and due to bone or leptomeningeal metastases in the remaining four cases. In five cases, the lesion of the XII cranial nerve was essential for the diagnosis of the neoplasm or the neoplastic recurrence and in four cases, it was the only affected cranial nerve.</dc:description>
