<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine the pattern of use of antihypertensive drugs in the Murcia Region, comparing the results with the national data, and detecting problems in order to make improvements, or establish hypotheses and to plan new studies. DESIGN Pharmacoepidemiological study (from 2004 to 2008) in accordance with the recommendations from World Heath Organization. SETTING : Murcia Region. PARTICIPANTS Annual census of each year. MAIN MEASUREMENTS The use of antihypertensive drugs was measured by the daily doses per 1000 inhabitans-day (DHD). RESULTS The use of antihypertensive drugs has significantly increased from 196.6 DHD to 235.8 DHD. The antihypertensives more used at the end of 2008 were: angiotensin II receptor blockers-ARB- (38.6%) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors-ACEI- (21.8%). There has been a tendency to change the use of rennin-angiotensin system blockers-RASB-, with an increase in ARB of 77.5% and and a decrease in ACEI 9.5%. The comparison with the national data shows qualitative and quantitative differences in the pattern of antihypertensive drugs used during the studied period. CONCLUSIONS The use of antihypertensive drugs in Murcia is less than in the rest of Spain. Therefore, this may be due to a problem of under treatment of this illness or other cardiovascular illnesses in the region. A greater use of ARB in Murcia and a lower use of ACEI was observed in Murcia. The differences found suggest that further studies are required to clarify their origins and causes, with the objective of achieving a more rational and efficient use of these drugs.</dc:description>
