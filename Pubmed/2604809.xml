<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hip fractures are the most disabling manifestation of osteoporosis. We reviewed all records of patients over 50 years old hospitalized with this diagnosis in San Pablo Hospital during 1987. Thirty cases were identified. The mean age of our population was higher than that reported in the literature. The mean length of stay was 16.8 days. There was a significant difference between the motor capacity of the patient prior to the precipitating event and 6 months after. The average for the in-hospital expenses was 8,826 dollars per patient. This value does not include the physician and rehabilitation costs. Mortality in the first six months was 23%. We estimate the incidence in our region at 116.5 annual cases per 100,000 persons over 50 years old.</dc:description>
