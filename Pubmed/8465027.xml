<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present two cases of community acquired pneumonia (extra-hospital) of severe onset, secondary to Chlamydia psittaci of avian origin. Each patient have bought a parakeet in the same pet-shop, and took care of them personally. Both developed a respiratory insufficiency, one of them needing mechanical ventilation. Out of nine relatives to whom serological determinations were performed, there was evidence of infection in two of them, but only one referred an auto-limited febrile syndrome during that period of time. Psittacosis incidence is discussed as origin of community acquired pneumonias, as well as its epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment.</dc:description>
