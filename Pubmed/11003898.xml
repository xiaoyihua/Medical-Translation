<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To investigate the influence of the maternity protocols on frequency and prevalence of breastfeeding in the 15 most important maternity units from the north-center region of Spain. METHODS From October 1992 to December 1992 we collected 1175 newborn babies and we followed them up for 12 months. A protocol study was designed to collect the data in DBase IV format and the statistical study was done with SPSS version Window 6.0. chi 2 test was applied. RESULTS The presence of the father at the delivery did not influence breastfeeding. The rooming-in was an adverse factor. Instrumental delivery and specially cesarean section act as an adverse factor for breastfeeding. To feed the baby with glucose or water and to delay the breast exposure was also negative to breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS The protocols used in the Spanish north-center maternity units are at a distance from those of Baby-friendly-Hospital Initiative. The early exposure to the breast and the restriction of bottle-feed with glucose in the early hours of life favours breast feeding. Instrumental delivery act as an adverse factor for breastfeeding.</dc:description>
