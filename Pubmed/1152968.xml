<dc:description xml:lang="en">A tumor like case of Cryptococcosis with a rare location in the abdomen of a young healthy woman is commented. It gave the opportunity to refer to the pathogeny of the disease, making in that way a brief review of the cases known in Venezuela and some not still published from which we got information. That review showed that generally doctors found more frequently organic lesions within the fields they are specially working for. It is obvious that mycosis must be considered in the diagnosis of nearly every patient in many countries and that laboratories must get appropriate equipment and personnel to help in that diagnosis.</dc:description>
