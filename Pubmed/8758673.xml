<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND A preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy regimen was applied to nonmetastatic osteosarcoma of the extremities in patients under 16 years of age to prevent the progress to metastatic disease and reduce the volume of the primary tumor in order to assess a conservative surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS A modified T-10 chemotherapy regimen was used before surgery, including high dose methotrexate, vincristine, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide and dactinomycin. After surgery patients with a grade of tumor necrosis &gt; 90% received the same regimen up to 45 weeks of treatment. For the cases with necrosis &lt; 90%, this regimen was substituted by adriamycin and cisplatinum. Survival was studied in relation with age, sex, tumor site, levels of alkaline phosphatase and LDH, surgical treatment and tumor necrosis in the surgical specimen after preoperative chemotherapy. Uni and multivariate analysis were performed. RESULTS Twenty seven patients with ages ranging from 5 to 15 years (median 11 years) were treated. The most common site of primary tumor was femur, followed by humerus and tibia. In 9 cases (33%) tumor necrosis was &gt; 90%. Consecutive surgery was performed in 20 patients and 7 suffered amputation or disarticulation of the extremity. Twenty patients remain alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 84 months. The probability of disease-free survival at 50 months is 71%. The only factor which influenced significantly the survival was the grade of tumor necrosis. Survival was 100% for the 9 patients with necrosis &gt; 90% and 53% for the 18 cases with necrosis &gt; 90% (p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy achieve disease-free survival in more than two thirds of patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma of the extremities and allow a non mutilating surgical treatment in the majority of them.</dc:description>
