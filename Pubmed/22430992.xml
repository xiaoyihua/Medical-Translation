<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this report is to describe a case of crystalline keratopathy caused by the Streptococcus mitis group corresponding to a patient who attended hospital for discomfort in her right eye. The ophthalmological examination showed an interrupted stitch of 10-0 nylon suture without tension and with attached mucus secretions. The loose suture was removed under aseptic conditions. Moxifloxacin 0.5 % eye drops were topically indicated. The treated eye successfully epithelialized and evolved favorably. However, after 15 days, a white tree-shaped infiltrate developed. A corneal sample was taken in the operating room, threading the intrastromal path of the removed stitch with a 7-0 vicryl suture. Vancomycin 50 mg/ml drops were indicated. The infiltrate, which was stable for 45 days, later increased its size and tissue necrosis occurred with danger of corneal perforation. A bipedicle conjunctival flap was performed in the affected corneal area, which evolved favorably. After spontaneous conjunctival flap retraction, only corneal scarring and neovascularization outside the visual axis were observed.</dc:description>
