<dc:description xml:lang="en">Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor which has been widely used as an antihypertensive agent and vasodilator. Although adverse skin effects occur in 10 % of patients prescribed this drug, there is little published data about photosensitivity. On the other hand, follicular mucinosis has been described in association with numerous processes, mainly lymphomas, lupus erythematosus and, less frequently, with photoinduced eruptions and drug reactions. We present the case of a female patient treated with captopril who developed an eruption in photoexposed areas. Histologically, the patient showed changes consistent with follicular mucinosis, with a positive captopril photopatch test and with resolution of the lesions after the antihypertensive agent was withdrawn.</dc:description>
