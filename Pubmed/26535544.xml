<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease risk factors begin in childhood. Their presence may predict cardiovascular disease in adulthood. OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors in a group of nurses´ children at a health facility in Bogotá, Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional, population-based observational study among 3-17 year-old individuals evaluated between June, 2011, and July, 2012. RESULTS A total number of 118 children were included. The mean age was 7.4 years, with a standard deviation of 3.86; 72.0% of the children had a normal weight. Prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors was distributed as follows: inadequate food habits, 89.0%; sedentary lifestyle, 78.8%; family history of cardiovascular disease, 16.1%; overweight, 15.3%, and obesity, 12.7%. There were no significant differences in risk factors between boys and girls. Among overweight and obese children, sedentary lifestyle was present in 90.9%, and among normal-weight children, in 36.5% (p&lt;0.001). Inadequate food habits were present in 84.8% of the overweight and obese children, and in 42.4% of those with normal weight (p&lt;0.001). Among the study population, 97.5% had at least one risk factor and 42.4% presented 3 or more. The presence of 3 or more cardiovascular disease risk factors was higher in obese children, when compared to overweight (p&lt;0.001) and normal-weight children (p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicate that there was a substantial burden of cardiovascular disease risk factors in the 3-17 year-old children included, particularly in those who were obese or overweight.</dc:description>
