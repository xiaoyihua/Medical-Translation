<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To analyze the preliminary results of the implementation of a living donor liver transplantation program. PATIENTS AND METHOD Between March and September 2000 we performed 7 living donor liver transplantations using the right hepatic lobe. The donors were 5 men and 2 women with a mean age of 39.3 11.5 years. Three donors were genetically related (daughter, mother, son). The mean relative liver volume transplanted was 58.8 2.5%. The mean age of the recipients was 50.4 16.5 years. Six patients presented hepatitis C virus-induced cirrhosis and one presented familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. RESULTS Three complications occurred in the donors: 1 slight infection and 2 biliary fistulae. Graft function was adequate in all recipients and there were three acute rejections. Four biliary leakages occurred of which two required reoperation. None of the patients developed vascular thrombosis. Two recipients died, 53 and 72 days after the operation, with a correctly functioning graft. CONCLUSION Living donor liver transplantation constitutes a necessary complement to the current cadaveric donor program to increase the number of patients who can benefit from this treatment, which may represent 10% of the activity of our center. The technical complexity of this procedure is much greater than that of cadaveric transplantation. The right hepatic lobe provides sufficient hepatic mass for most adult recipients.</dc:description>
