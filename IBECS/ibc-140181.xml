<dc:title xml:lang="en">Hospital-based multicenter study in Spain, Mexico and Cuba on attitudes to living liver donation</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Introduction: Given the lack of a sufficient number of livers available for transplantation, living liver donation (LLD) is being developed in the Spanish-speaking world. To do this, it is essential that health workers in hospitals are in favor of such donation, given that they are a key component in this treatment and that their attitudes influence public opinion. Objective: To analyze attitude toward LLD among hospital personnel from healthcare centers in Spain and Latin America. Material and method: Ten hospitals were selected from the «International Donor Collaborative Project»: 3 from Spain, 5 from Mexico and 2 from Cuba. Random sampling stratified by type of service and job category was used. Attitudes to LLD were evaluated through a validated questionnaire on psychosocial aspects. The questionnaire was anonymous and self-administered. Statistical tests consisted of Student's T test, the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the 2,618 employees surveyed, 85% (n = 2,231) were in favor of related LLD; of these, 31% (n = 804) were in favor of unrelated LLD. No association was found between the country of the interviewed, personal-social variables or work-related variables. The following factors were associated with a favorable attitude toward related LLD donation: having had personal experience of donation and transplantation (P &lt; .001); being in favor of deceased donation (P &lt; .001); believing that one might need a possible transplant (P &lt; .001); being in favor of living kidney donation (P &lt; .001); being willing to accept a liver from a living donor (P &lt; .001); having discussed the matter of donation and transplantation within the family (P &lt; .001) and with one's partner (P &lt; .001); carrying out pro-social type activities (P &lt; .001); being Catholic (P = .040); believing that one's religion is in favor of donation and transplantation (P &lt; .001); and not being concerned about the possible mutilation of the body after donation (P &lt; .001). Conclusions: Hospital personnel from Spain and Latin America had a favorable attitude toward LLD, which was associated with factors directly and indirectly related to donation and transplantation, family and religious factors, and attitudes toward the body (AU)</dc:description>
