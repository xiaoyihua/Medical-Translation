<dc:description xml:lang="en">Liver paté is a boiled sausage that, due to its nature and composition, has an appropriate environment for bacterial development. In order to determine the variation in the bacterial development during the processing of this sausage, bacteriological examinations were carried out in three stages of preparation. This involved, first, the fresh product, then, after boiling it, and finally on the 6th day, after cold storage at 0 degrees C. Of the bacterial counts obtained it was determined that boiling greatly reduces the number of bacteria, especially the Gram negative ones, a situation which lasts through the storage period studied. The relationship between initial and final bacterial content of liver paté, clearly shows the influence of contamination of the raw materials employed, on the microbiological quality of the marketed product.</dc:description>
