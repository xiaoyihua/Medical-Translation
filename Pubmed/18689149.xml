<dc:description xml:lang="en">The chronic hyperglycemic state in diabetic patients produces an aggression to the vascular endothelium leading to a premature development of atherosclerosis. The objective of this paper was to determine the soluble E-selectin (sE-S) levels in children with type 1 diabetes (DT1) and its relationship with glycemic control and lipid profile. Thirty patients with DT1, (16 girls and 14 boys), age between 6 and 15 years were studied, whose data were compared with 20 control subjects. In both groups sE-S was determined as well as fasting glycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C, non-HDL-C and triglycerides (TG). sE-S values were 66% higher in diabetics than in control subjects (p = 0.001). Patients were grouped in: good glycemic control diabetics (GGCD, HbA1c &lt; or = 8%) and poor glycemic control diabetics (PGCD, HbA1c &gt; 8%). sE-S concentratios were in PGCD an GGCD respectively. 111.3 +/- 40.5 vs 68.0 +/- 11.3 ng/ml, p = 0.02. In the diabetic group, the incidence of non desirable values in the lipid profile parameters were: TC 50%; HDL-C 14%; LDL-C 52%, non-HDL-C 26.7% and TG 14%. sE-S values were better correlated with HbA1c (r = 0.53, p = 0.0001) than fasting glycemia (r = 0.36, p = 0.008), and CT (r = 0.36, p = 0.009). These results suggest that sE-S is an early marker of endothelial dysfunction and a probable risk marker of atherosclerosis in children with DT1.</dc:description>
