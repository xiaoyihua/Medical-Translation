<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To study the renal function (FR) of the hypertensive patients by means of estimating equations and serum creatinine (Crp). To calculate the percentage of patients with chronic kidney disease (ERC) that present normal values of Crp. To analyze which factors collaborate in the deterioration of the FR. METHODS Descriptive cross-sectional study of patients with HTA. Crp and arterial tension (TA) were determined. The glomerular filtration rate was calculated by means of Cockroft-Gault and MDRD's formula. The years of evolution of the HTA were registered. A descriptive study of the variables and the possible dependence among them was completed, using several times linear multiple regression. RESULTS 52 patients were studied (57,7% women). Average age 72,4 +/- 10,8. 32,6% (Cockcroft-Gault) or 21,5% (MDRD) were fulfilling ERC criterion. The ERC was mainly diagnosed in females. 21,4% (Cockcroft-Gault) and 9,5 % patients (MDRD) with ERC had normal Crp values. We do not find linear dependence between the numbers of TA and the FR. The TA check-up objectives do not suppose less development of ERC. In males we find linear dependence within the FR (MDRD) and the years of evolution of the HTA. CONCLUSION The ERC is a frequent pathology in the hypertense persons. The systematical utilization of estimating equations facilitates the detection of hidden ERC in patients with normal Crp.</dc:description>
