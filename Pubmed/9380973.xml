<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To determine the frequency, time of occurrence and factors associated with the failure of the permanent peritoneal catheter during dialysis in cases of chronic renal failure (CRF). MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective cohort under a nested case control design was studied at a second level health care unit of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social. A total of 149 catheters, double cushion straight Tenckhoff type, were evaluated in 74 patients with CRF due to diabetic nephropathy in 36/74 patients (49%). Information concerning functionality time and causes of catheter failure as well as the clinical and technical factors concerning insertion were obtained from the clinical chart. RESULTS The cumulated time of dialysis was 814 months. Catheter failure occurred in 101 cases (68%): 67 due to obstruction, 24 due to infection, to leakage in 6 and to other causes in 4. Those of non-infectious origin were more frequent (p &lt; 0.01). In the first month post-insertion there was a higher number of failures than after one month, (p &lt; 0.0005). The global functionality of the catheter at one month, one and two years was 55%, 31% and 16%, respectively. There was a greater permanence of the catheters in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis than in intermittent peritoneal dialysis (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS It is concluded that the frequency of the peritoneal catheter failure was high; that the most frequent cause was due to non-infectious complications during the first month of insertion; and the factor associated to catheter failure was intermittent peritoneal dialysis as compared to continuous ambulatory dialysis.</dc:description>
