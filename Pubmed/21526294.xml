<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Heart failure (HF) is characterized, among other features, by the development of alterations in myocardial energy metabolism, involving a decrease in glucose utilization and increased free fatty acid uptake by cardiomyocytes, associated with decreased deposits of high-energy phosphates (creatine phosphate/creatine transporter). Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allows a direct and noninvasive assessment of myocardial metabolites. AIM To measure myocardial creatine and lipids by MR spectroscopy among patients with HF. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cardiac MR spectroscopy (1.5 Tesla) with Hydrogen antenna and single voxel acquisition was performed in five patients with non-ischemic heart failure, aged 58 ± 9.7 years, (60% males) and 5 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex. We analyzed the signals of creatine (Cr), lipids (L) and water (W) in the interventricular septum, establishing the water/lipid (W/L) and water/creatine (W/Cr) index to normalize the values obtained. RESULTS Among patients, left ventricular ejection fraction was 32 ± 6.9%, 60% were in functional capacity II, 60% had hypertension and one was diabetic. Spectroscopic curves showed a depletion of total Cr, evidenced by the W/ Cr index, among patients with heart failure, when compared with healthy controls (1.46 ± 1.21 and 5.96 ± 2.25 respectively, p &lt; 0,05). Differences in myocardial lipid content, measured as the W/L index, were not significant (5.06 ± 2.66 and 1.80 ± 1.62 respectively, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with heart failure of non-ischemic etiology, there is a depletion of creatine levels measured by MR spectroscopy.</dc:description>
