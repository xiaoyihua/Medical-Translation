<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Thirty asthmatic patients were evaluated to assess the association of therapy with inhalatory corticosteroids and an educational program, EDUCASMA. Spirometric evaluation with Flow-Volume loop (MEDICAL GRAPHIC CPF-S), ambulatory FEP (mini WRIGHT meters) was performed. In regard of initial symptoms patients were qualified as moderate or severe. After two weeks of a screening period, they were randomized into 2 groups: a) beclomethasone; b) budesonide; respective doses in according to the initial status. During the study period (8 wks) they visited the medical Staff six or more times. In each visit the patients received clinical evaluation (i.e. clinical scoring), spirometry (i.e. FEV1), and FEP ambulatory revision. FEP x (mean), FEP delta, FEV1, and clinical scores values were matched at the start and at the end of the follow-up period. Non-parametric statistics were applied (Wilcoxon test) and significative changes were defined (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS 1) inhalatory corticosteroids therapy associated with a previous educational program could achieve early improvements of clinical scores; 2) in moderate asthma ambulatory FEP showed objective changes both in beclomethasone and budesonide treatments. It appears to indicate increasing changes very close to the clinical improvement; 3) the short period of our observation and the inflammatory condition of airways in severe asthma, could be explained as probable factors for the minor differences in the FEV1 evaluation; 4) no differences between budesonide and beclomethasone treatment were found.</dc:description>
