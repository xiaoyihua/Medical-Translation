<dc:description xml:lang="en">The systemic treatment of herpes zoster shortens the healing process, and prevents or alleviates pain and other acute or chronic complications, especially when it is administered in the first 72 hours after symptoms appear. This treatment is especially indicated in patients over the age of 50 and in those who, regardless of age, have head and neck involvement, especially in herpes zoster ophthalmicus. The drugs approved in Europe for the systemic treatment of herpes zoster are aciclovir, valaciclovir, famciclovir and brivudine. Brivudine shows greater effectiveness against the varicella-zoster virus than aciclovir and its derivatives, and can be given just once a day for seven days, compared to multiple doses of the latter. As opposed to the others, brivudine is a non-nephrotoxic drug that should not be administered to immunodepressed patients or to those being treated with 5-fluorouracil. The treatment of herpes zoster to reduce pain should be combined with analgesics and neuroactive agents (amitriptyline, gabapentin, etc). While corticosteroids are of dubious efficacy in the treatment of post-herpes neuralgia, the intensity and duration of the pain can be reduced with some topical treatments (capsaicin, lidocaine patches, etc). Finally, this review discusses treatment guidelines for special locations (cranial nerves) and different subpopulations (children, pregnant women, immunodepressed patients, etc).</dc:description>
