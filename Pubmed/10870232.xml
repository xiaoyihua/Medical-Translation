<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report twenty-four patients with urinary obstruction, in which twenty-seven antegrade ureteral stent (double J) insertions were attempted (in six patients the obstruction was bilateral and in three other patients we failed). In all of them access to the urinary tract was through a nephrostomy catheter, in seventeen cases we proceeded to insert the antegrade catheter immediately after percutaneous nephrostomy and in ten remaining cases we achieved in a second try after carrying nephrostomy and failing a conventional retrograde approach to ureteral stent insertion. We got a 90-per cent success rate. A case of perirrenal hematoma occurred after applying a nephrostomy. It was the only relevant complication. In conclusion we consider that the antegrade ureteral stent insertion is a good alternative when, under several circumstances, the conventional retrograde insertion fails.</dc:description>
