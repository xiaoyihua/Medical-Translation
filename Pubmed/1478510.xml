<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Murless head extractor has been used since long time ago as a vector, extractor and head rotator through cesarean section diminishing the injury feto-maternal. From march to june 1991, 50 patients with cesarean section indication and with fetus in head presentation were gotten out using this way, analyzing 12 maternal parameters and 9 fetal. The most frequent indication of cesarean section was severe Preeclampsia 41%, third cesarean section 14.7%, fetal distress 14.7%, low reserve fetal 11.7%, PROM 8.8% and others 9.1%. The height of the head was at the first plane in 59.4%. The Apgar score at the minute was of 9 in 6.0%, of 8 in 60.6%, of 7 in 18.1%, of 6 in 12.1% of 4 in 3.3%. The Apgar score at five minutes was 9 in 84.8% and 8 in 12.1% for a total of 96.9%. An USG transfontanelar was practiced in 40 products from which 37 (92.5%) were normal and in 3 (7.5%) it was found: in one brain light edema and in two hypoxical encephalopathy (caused by severe Preeclampsia, chronic hypertension and superimposed preeclampsia and fetal distress due to cord around the neck. In the other ten cases USG was not used for another reasons. Maternal morbi-mortality and general due to extractor use, was not obtained not either fetal morbi-mortality. It was concluded that the head extractor is useful, does not increase the obstetrical injury and it is easily applied).</dc:description>
