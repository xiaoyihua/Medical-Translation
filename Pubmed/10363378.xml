<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper presents the results obtained with a C.F.C. type ureterosygmoidostomy technique described by us. A total of 25 patients aged between 52 and 74 years (mean age, 65 years), 23 (23/25) male and 2 (2/25) female were evaluated. 24 of the total 25 patients had infiltrant neoplasia of the bladder (pT2: 8; pT3a: 12; pT3b: 4) which was graded as moderately differentiated (G2: 10) or undifferentiated (G3: 14). The remaining patient, a female, had tuberculous microbladder. Male patients underwent radical cystoprostatectomy (23/25); while in two females traditional cystectomy was performed (2/25). Patients with neoplasia of the bladder (24/25) were performed bilateral lymphadenectomy prior to radical surgery. All 25 patients were performed C.F.C. type ureterosygmoidostomy (Actas Urol Esp 20: 324, 1996). Follow-up of patients was carried out over a mean period of 27 months (July 1994-October 1997). The complications reported were 4 cases of ureterointestinal stricture and one stercoral fistula. The strictures were resolved with endoscopic techniques and the fistula through discharge colostomy. Death (6/25) occurred as a result of the tumour progression, and in no case was related to the surgical technique. All patients showed daytime continence (100%), and 22/25 were also continent during the nighttime (88%): there were occasional leaks in 5/25 (20%). No metabolic disorders were seen in any of the patients. (All patients were given drug therapy to prevent metabolic acidosis).</dc:description>
