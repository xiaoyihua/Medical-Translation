<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The biologic, cognitive and sociocultural changes that occur during adolescence include a wide range such as to be best treated by internists, but focus in old ages is increasing and younger are being treated by others specialists. We review the data of those adolescents attended in our Hospital and discuss Internal Medicine interest in adolescents. MATERIAL AND METHODS Epidemiological data, and clinical status of those patients between 15 and 21 years old admitted in our hospital during the period 1996-2002 were analysed. RESULTS 5894 admissions of adolescent s patients were made in this period. 1326 (23%) where attended in the Internal Medicine Department. 755 (57%) were male. Main causes of admission were infectious diseases, (mostly urinary tract and respiratory infections). Tobacco and alcohol abuse were present in 160 (6%) patients. DISCUSSION Adolescence marks the transition from childhood to adulthood. Health problems and deaths among adolescents and young adults result from accidents (mostly from motor vehicle), but there are conditions usually matter of our speciality. A significant number of patients are been attended by Paediatrics Department and such a speciality as Adolescence Medicine is mostly integrated by paediatric specialists. We consider as this paper show, these ages ranges are clearly matter of our specialty and best treated by internists, but probably need a better consideration in our training. The opportunity to incorporate more adolescents into practice if realized, could prove challenging for internists.</dc:description>
