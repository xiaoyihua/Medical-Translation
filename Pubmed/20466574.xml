<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify barriers to the utilization of research as perceived by Spanish nurses in clinical practice and by nurses who have been principal investigators of a research project funded by the national health research funding agency. METHOD Cross-sectional, descriptive and observational study conducted in 2006 in hospitals, primary care health centres and nursing schools from the 17 Spanish Regions. Principal investigators of at least one project funded by the national health research funding agency between 1998 and 2004 were also included. A Spanish version of The BARRIERS to Research Utilization Scale was used. Socio-demographic and occupational variables were gathered with a questionnaire developed by the research team, which was self-administered. RESULTS A final sample of 854 out of 1,026 registered nurses (83.43%), and 69 principal investigator nurses out of 86 (80.23%) completed the survey. Highest rated barriers in the group of clinical practicing nurses were: "There is insufficient time on the job to implement new ideas" (mean=3.13; SD=1.08), "The nurse is unaware of the research" (mean=2.84; SD=1.14). Amongst principal investigators, the items rated highest were "The nurse is unaware of the research" (mean=3.12; SD=1.15) "The nurse does not feel capable of evaluating the quality of the research" (mean=2.97; SD=0.88). CONCLUSIONS Clinical nurses tend to believe that time pressures stand in the way of implementing research findings in practice. Results are consistent with studies in other countries and maintained over time.</dc:description>
