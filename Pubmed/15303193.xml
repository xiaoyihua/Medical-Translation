<dc:description xml:lang="en">We aimed to establish the consumption profile of licit and illicit drugs, consumption patterns and strategies for coping and resisting alcohol, tobacco and other drugs among adolescents in higher middle education. This study was based on concepts developed by specialized authors and considered the subject's behavioral, psychological and normative characteristics. The non-probabilistic sample consisted of 325 adolescents. Results indicated that 67%, 65% and 7% of the adolescents, respectively, accepted they had already used alcohol, tobacco and marijuana at some time in their life and that 33%, 38% and 3%, respectively, had used these same substances over the last month; 65% consider most of their colleagues have used these substances; 56% had to reject an offer to consume alcohol, 64% tobacco and 51% marijuana over the last month. On the basis of these findings, we recommend the implementation of a prevention program aimed at supporting the adolescent's resources to resist pressure towards consumption.</dc:description>
