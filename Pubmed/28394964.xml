<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The association of cardiovascular diseases with socio-demographic factors has not been fully explored. AIM To analyze the association of socio-demographic features with the survival time of individuals who died due to cardiovascular diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS The death registries published by the Ministry of Health were analyzed. All deaths due to cardiovascular diseases occurred between 2001 and 2013 in people aged over one year were considered. Using a principal component analysis, the age at death was associated with socio-demographic features such as sex, marital status, residence zone, schooling, work status and medical care prior to death. RESULTS A total of 293,370 cardiovascular deaths were analyzed. The median age at death was 77 years. Not receiving medical care prior to death, was significantly associated with a lower age at the moment of the decease, mainly between 20 and 80 years of age. Among men, being occupationally active (hazard ratio (HR = 1.5 p &lt; 0.01) and being unemployed (HR = 1.1 p &lt; 0.01) were risks factors for early cardiovascular death. Being married, having higher schooling, residing in urban areas and having prior medical care were associated with a higher age at the moment of decease. CONCLUSIONS Socio-demographic profiles are associated with the age at death due to cardiovascular diseases. The effect of not receiving medical care on the age at death is noteworthy and reflects social inequities in the access to health care.</dc:description>
