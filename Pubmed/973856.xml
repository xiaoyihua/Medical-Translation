<dc:description xml:lang="en">Report is made of a case of an unusual localization of a trichobezoar in a 12 year-old girl, who presented vomiting and abdominal pain as chief complaints. She was found to have an 18 X 5 cm palpable abdominal mass, which upon surgery was localized in terminal ileum and in the pathology report was found to be a trichobezoar. The interest of this case is the unusual localization of a single bezoar and the fact that a resection of 25 cm. of small bowel had to be done, as it was found necrotic at the time of surgery.</dc:description>
