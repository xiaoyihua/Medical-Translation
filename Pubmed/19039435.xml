<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify factors (sociodemographic, health, and social support) associated with the presence of accidental injuries in older adults living in deprived urban neighborhoods in four Mexican municipalities. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cross-sectional survey carried out in 2004-2005, with a non-probabilistic, intentional sample of 799 male and female elderly living in deprived urban areas in four Mexican municipalities. For the statistical analysis, non-parametric tests and multivariate logistic regression models were used. RESULTS More than a third (37%) of the sample reported injuries; with falls being the main cause. Home was the venue where most accidents took place (52%). Risk factors for accidental injuries were: advanced age, working, greater number of illnesses, consumption of more medicines and remedies, self-perception of "poor" health , consumption of alcoholic beverages, inadequate family support and being a caretaker of others. CONCLUSIONS The multi-causality of accidental injuries in older adults demands the participation of all sectors of society, and particularly public health interventions.</dc:description>
