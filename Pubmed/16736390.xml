<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The bulk of research on Family Interventions concentrates on assessing its efficacy in reducing psychotic relapses, there being very little research into its ability to reduce the morbidity of the main caregiver over the course of time. METHOD Follow-up study at five years of a cohort of informal caregivers of persons with schizophrenia who had taken part in an empirical trial with two therapeutic approaches assigned at random. RESULTS 87.7 % of main caregivers are women and they tend to care for more chronic and inactive patients than men (p &lt; 0.041). More than 55% of main caregivers had high General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) scores, with women suffering more emotional repercussions than men. Morbidity gradually declines over time (GHQ scores: 8.1 before intervention; 6.9 at the end of intervention and 4.6 five years later) although statistical significance was only achieved when taking the entire period into account, i.e., from beginning to the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Family intervention over a limited period followed by a support group gradually reduces morbidity of the caregiver to a significant level at five years, although this reduction is not associated with the type of setting or the absence or presence of the patient. Clinical implications are discussed and likewise the need for a more equitable distribution of responsibilities and risk.</dc:description>
