<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To determine the middle-term effectiveness of a support program for smokers (SPS) wishing to quit. DESIGN Observational, cohort follow-up study. SETTING Primary care. PARTICIPANTS Random sample (n=289) of patients older than 14 years who took part in the SPS between 1 July 1998 and 30 September 2001, from among a total of 987 patients who had been seen in the primary care center for any reason during this period. INTERVENTIONS Systematic minimal intervention, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), or both. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES A telephone survey was used to study smoker/ex-smoker status, relapses, mean period of abstention and number of attempts to quit after the study period. Information obtained from the data sheets used in the program included sociodemographic characteristics, smoking habits, chronic illnesses, degree of dependence and motivation, use of NRT, and participation in the program. RESULTS Of all patients in the program, 27% quit, with a mean period of abstinence of 23 months at the time of the study. The success rate was higher among older participants, men, participants who has been smokers for longer periods, those who were more highly motivated to quit, and those who did not use NRT. Of all participants, 35.6% failed to quit, and of these, 75% relapsed within the first 6 months. CONCLUSIONS The SPS offered within the primary care setting was effective and feasible, although participants should be followed closely during the first months so they can be advised to accept the fact that relapses are part of the quitting process.</dc:description>
