<dc:description xml:lang="en">The operative study of the common bile duct was carried out with the hydrodynamics methods (flow and resting pressure) in 433 patients and with the operative cholangiography in 383 patients. The hydrodynamics explorations pointed-out a margin of mistake due to falses positives and negatives of the 2.7% and the operative cholangiographies of the 8.6%. The association of both methods, hydrodynamics and radiologycs, allowed us to estimate that the diagnostic mistake is reduced to 0%. It is established in this work the necessity of carring out the flow, the measure of the resting pressure and the cholangiographies; in all the patients that are operated on the biliary tract because the diagnostic accuracy is the 100%. It is discussed the value of the diameter of the common bile duct for affirming the eventual existence of obstruction of the lower part of the common bile duct and the values are correlated, measured in mm., with pathological founds. It is considered the value of the hydrodynamics methods in the diagnostic of the stenosis of the sphincter of Oddi.</dc:description>
