<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors studied two patients with bullous lesions with onset at adult age. There were no relatives with bullous disease. After minor traumas, mainly in hands, feet, elbows and knees, one could see the onset of the blisters, which vanished leaving atrophic scars. Nails and mucosae were involved in both patients. The female patient had cyst of milia. One of the patients had lymph node tuberculosis as associated disease. Through exhaustive clinical examination and laboratory investigation, the authors excluded other types of bullous diseases. Histopathology of the lesions, electron microscopy, direct and indirect immunofluorescence, supported the diagnosis of Acquired Dermolytic Bullous Dermatosis.</dc:description>
