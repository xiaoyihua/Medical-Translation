<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of balloon dilatation in the treatment of ureteral strictures and analyze the outcome according to its etiology. METHODS 77 ureteral dilatations were performed in 74 patients. Most of the strictures were postoperative sequelae and the other cases were due to chronic inflammatory conditions. RESULTS The overall success rate was 47%, partial improvement was achieved in 17% and the failure rate was 36%. In our series, the postoperative strictures responded slightly better to balloon dilatation than those arising from chronic inflammatory conditions. CONCLUSION Endourologic techniques based on the percutaneous methods of interventional radiology have reduced the usage of invasive conventional surgery in the treatment of strictures. Although the proportion of unsatisfactory results is not negligible, balloon dilatation should be the first treatment option for ureteral strictures because it is less invasive, carries a low morbidity and requires a shorter hospitalization. If the results are unsatisfactory, re-dilatation can be attempted or conventional open surgery can be performed.</dc:description>
