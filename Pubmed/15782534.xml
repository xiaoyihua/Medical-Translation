<dc:description xml:lang="en">The maternal-fetal interphase has an active Immunitary System (IS) whose mediators -cells, cytokines and chemokines- coordinately act to favour pregnancy normal development. It is not known exactly which of those mediators are present in each placental cellular stratus and what the physiological or potentially pathologic consequences derived from their presence can be. It is known that chemokines recruit cells with regulatory activity towards the deciduous and some of their receptors are coreceptors to infectious agents like HIV, making research of chemokines expression and their receptors in the maternal-fetal interphase of great interest in recent years. In the present study, the CXCR-4 and CCR-5 expression was investigated in 8 samples of normal human placenta obtained from term pregnancies, with low obstetric risk, by using Immunocitochemical techniques (Biotin-Avidin-Peroxidase). The most relevant finding in this study was the demonstration that CXCR-4 and CCR-5 differential expression in trophoblast, stroma and endothelium represents, as far as we know, the first report of the presence of these receptors in all layers of placental tissue. These results help to broaden the knowledge about the expression of chemokines receptors -that act as main coreceptors in the HIV infection- in the maternal-fetal interphase, and this can be a contribution to be taken into account in the vertical transmission study of this infectious agent.</dc:description>
