<dc:description xml:lang="en">The following review summarises the most important articles published on sleep apnea-hypopneasyndrome (SAHS) during the current year. The analysis of the many factors implicated in the risk ofcardiovascular diseases associated with SAHS is currently of great interest to the scientific community.There are many studies on this subject that demonstrate the role of inflammatory and immunologicalmediators, their relationship with endothelial damage and their influence in the genesis of cardiovasculardisease in patients with SAHS. The role of CPAP in preventing this cardiovascular risk has had varied results.Although there is no evidence of benefit or harm in its use in heart failure, in cerebrovascular accidentsSAHS has been confirmed as a predisposing factor and the reported increase in mortality would justify theintention to treat SAHS in these patients. Likewise, the reduction in blood pressure found with CPAPtreatment could reduce the risk of cardio-cerebrovascular disease. The recent knowledge that there isexpression of multiple phenotypes of SAHS gives a glimpse in the future of a disease based on differentspecific phenotypes, where the traditional symptomatology that defined the syndrome does not limit itstreatment. To obtain a reliable and cost-effective diagnostic method that responds to the demands of thepublic health problem that is SAHS, particularly in sectors of the population that remain under-diagnosedand less well known, such as children, women and the elderly population is another one of the challengesreflected in published studies. In short, the growing knowledge on the biology of SAHS, its cardiovascularimplications and its effect on the morbidity and mortality of the population will enable us to understandthe true dimension of this disease in the next few years(AU)</dc:description>
