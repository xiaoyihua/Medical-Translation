<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Administration of dipyridamole produces angina and ST depression in 20%-30% and 6%-34% of patients, respectively. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical implications of the presentation of angina and/or ST depression during the administration of dipyridamole in the study of coronary heart disease by myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS). METHODS The study population is constituted by 593 consecutive patients without left branch block or ventricular pacemaker rhythm who were referred to our service to undergo MPS with dipyridamole. A SPECT was performed after the administration of 99mTc-tetrosfosmine and drug stimulation with dipyridamole (0.142 mg/kg/min for 4 minutes). A coronariography was performed in 338 patients (57%). The frequency of clinical and electrical positivity and their relationship with the MPS and the coronariography were studied. RESULTS The rate of angina and ST depression was 32% (n = 190) and 10% (n = 58), respectively. Myocardial perfusion defects were observed in 465 patients (78%), and signs of scintigraphic ischemia in 311 (52%). The patients with ST depression presented a higher frequency of perfusion defects (93% vs 76%, p = 0.0012) and scintigraphic ischemia (89% vs 49%, p &lt; 0.0001). In addition, perfusion defects in more than one territory were observed in these patients in a higher percentage (53% vs 34%, p = 0.0036). Among the patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, those who had a ST depression had a greater extension of coronary heart disease (1.8 +/- 1.2 vs 1.3 +/- 1.0 diseased vessels, respectively. p = 0.0100) and a higher frequency of multivessel disease (61% vs 43%, p = 0.0380). Those patients who had clinical positivity showed a scintigraphic ischemia more frequently (66% vs 47%, p &lt; 0.0001), however no statistically significant differences were observed between the presence of patients with perfusion defects or in the extension of these defects as well as in the number of diseased vessels in the coronariographic study. CONCLUSIONS During the administration of dipyridamole, the ST depression is associated with more frequent scintigraphic ischemia, larger extension of perfusion defects and more diseased vessels. The appearance of angina is associated with scintigraphic ischemia, but it is not necessarily associated with the extension of perfusion defects or greater number of diseased vessels.</dc:description>
