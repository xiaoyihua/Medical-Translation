<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM The aim of our study was to evaluate left ventricular function of diastolic in young (&lt; 40 years) asymptomatic patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus free of cardiovascular disease symptoms and to analyze the associated factors to the left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirty-five type-1 diabetic patients (mean age 27.8+/-7.5 years) old and 54 healthy controls (mean age 26.1+/-4.1 years) were studied. Anamnesis, physical exploration, general analytical studies, microalbuminuric and Doppler-echocardiographic studies were performed. RESULTS The LVDD was present in 13 (37.1%) of the diabetic patients and none of the control patients. The ratio of peak early to peak late (atrial) filling velocity was significantly decreased in diabetic compared with control subjects (1.1+/-0.3 versus 1.5+/-0.2; p&lt;0.01). The isovolumetric relaxation time was increased in diabetic patients compared with control subjects (104+/-11 versus 79+/-11; p&lt;0.01). Diabetics with LVDD were older aged, predominantly males, had worse glucemic control, more alteration of lipidic metabolism and higher levels of microalbuminuria, than diabetics without LVDD. CONCLUSIONS The LVDD is frequent in young diabetics free of cardiovascular disease symptoms. These studies suggest that because this patients were of older age, of the masculine sex with, poor glucemic control, altered lipidic metabolism, and microalbuminuria they might be a group that is associated with LVDD which, in the absence of cardiovascular disease, might be an early preclinical alteration, potentially related to subsequent development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.</dc:description>
