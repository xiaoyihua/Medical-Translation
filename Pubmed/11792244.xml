<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The introduction of surfactant replacement therapy in the management of respiratory distress syndrome in the premature infant was a remarkable advance in neonatal intensive care. In the last few years, recognition of the role played by surfactant inactivation in the pathogenesis of other respiratory diseases of the newborn has justified new therapeutic applications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with natural exogenous surfactant in situations with secondary surfactant deficiency. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of the evolution of 15 newborn infants treated with natural exogenous surfactant. Nine infants had meconium aspiration syndrome, five had congenital pneumonia and one had adult respiratory distress syndrome. Oxygenation indexes before and after surfactant treatment as well as clinical and radiographic evolution were compared. RESULTS The 12 surviving infants showed improvement in oxygenation and radiographic alterations after surfactant administration. Three patients with meconium aspiration syndrome died. CONCLUSIONS These results support the therapeutic use of exogenous surfactant in severe respiratory diseases of the newborn causing secondary surfactant deficiency.</dc:description>
