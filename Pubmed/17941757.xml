<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse the use of psychoactive drugs in a health and welfare centre and compare this use with current guidelines. METHOD A cross-sectional study of the drug treatment regime of hospitalised patients in a health and welfare centre was carried out. Information was obtained from prescriptions and the clinical histories of patients in the centre. The following variables were assessed: demographic data, treatment with psychoactive drugs, date of commencing treatment, dosage, drug combinations, indication and total number of drugs analysed. The results were compared with the literature and current prescription guidelines. RESULTS 45 of the 70 patients analysed were taking psychoactive drugs: 51.1% were being treated with neuroleptic drugs, 42.2% with antidepressants, and 6.7% with anxiolytic agents. 62% were women. The overall mean age was 80.3 years old. The average number of psychoactive drugs administered to each patient was 1.6 and the average number of total drugs prescribed was 10.5. The most frequently administered psychoactive drugs were risperidone, lorazepam and citalopram. The most frequent association was neuroleptic drugs with benzodiazepine. The indication and dosage prescribed were appropriate according to the data sheet, although some inappropriate prescription practices were observed. CONCLUSIONS The results of the study would recommend controlling the duration of treatment with benzodiazepine, confirming the diagnosis of states of depression and correctly monitoring the associations between psychoactive drugs.</dc:description>
