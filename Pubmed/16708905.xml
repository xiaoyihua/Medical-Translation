<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to evaluate the effect of postnatal hyperoxia on retinal structure, newborn rats were exposed to different oxygenation intervals (80 +/- 1%) with three interruptions of 21% (30 min each). Four groups of rats were exposed from birth to the 6th, 9th, 12th and 14th postnatal day, respectively and another group was placed under normoxia. After this period all oxygenated groups and the controls remained under normoxia until they were 30 days old for the structural analysis of retina. Retinal histology was carried out using conventional techniques for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the ganglion cell layer of the retina from rats exposed for 9 days to hyperoxia, capillaries with large projections toward the lumen, were observed as a possible consequence of cellular edema of endothelium. The most severe damage was observed in rats exposed to hyperoxia during 12 and 14 days, showing mitochondrias swollen up and without crests in the areas surrounding the capillaries, necrosis and apoptosis processes, dense bodies, cells with swollen cytoplasms and rupture of the plasmatic membrane. The results suggest that postnatal hyperoxia causes severe damages to the retina in developing rats with a direct relationship between the time exposed to oxygen and ultra structural damages.</dc:description>
