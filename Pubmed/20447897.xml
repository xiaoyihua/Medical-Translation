<dc:description xml:lang="en">The acquisition of medical competence in the Internal Medicine Residencies (IMR) is a complex process. In Argentina there are not current data available on the number, organization and the way the residencies work. The objective of this study was to survey the IMR in Argentina and categorize their academic and general structure. From June 2007 to June 2008 we identified all the IMR using a combined searching strategy. We contacted them looking for structural and organizational data. Academic data were collected in a sample of 24 residencies using questionnaires. We also gathered data using qualitative measurements, in a subsample of 15 residencies, by means of direct observation and in-depth interviews. We identified 162 ongoing residencies and a total of 2012 residents. The majority of them (87%) were located in big cities, with a preponderance of public residencies (66%); 13% of these didn't have a residency instructor or coordinator. Most of these didn't have Institutional Internet available. The residents median age was 29 years old (Intercuartil range 2.7), with a 64.5% of women; 24% were under the regimen called "concurrente". From the sample, 230 residents were interviewed; 13% of them (CI95% 9-18.7) did not receive any remuneration. The rest received a monthly payment (in Arg $) ranging from US$ 140 to 552. A 58% (13/22) was involved in Specialist courses. Medians for weekly working hours and for "on duty" were respectively 50 and 8 per month, with no difference between public or private institutions. These findings evidence the need to certify the formative and academic process of IMR.</dc:description>
