<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To conduct a descriptive analysis of a series of patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVM) that had been treated surgically. PATIENTS AND METHODS Of a total of 189 adult patients with AVM evaluated consecutively in our hospital, 100 patients who had undergone surgical treatment were selected; a number of demographic, clinical and radiological aspects were then analysed, together with data concerning any associated vascular lesions, the type of surgical treatment, angiographic results and clinical outcomes. RESULTS The mean age was 34 years (range: 15-71 years). The most common presenting symptom was intracranial haemorrhage, which occurred in 60 cases (60%). The AVM were located in the supratentorial convexity in 79% of cases, 8% were deep and 13% were situated in the cerebellum. The most frequent degree, according to the Spetzler and Martin scale, was grade III. Seventeen patients had other associated lesions and it should be noted that eight patients had aneurysms. Most of the patients (78%) underwent elective surgery and, in two cases, post-embolisation. Surgical treatment (salvage surgery) was performed in 13 patients (13%) when other therapeutic options failed and seven patients were submitted to emergency operations because of brain haemorrhages. The postoperative angiographic study showed complete removal of the AVM in 98% of cases. The clinical outcomes were as follows: 75%, good recovery; 20%, moderate incapacity; and 5%, an important degree of incapacity. CONCLUSION Surgery is the best therapeutic option for patients with AVM, if they are selected in an appropriate manner.</dc:description>
