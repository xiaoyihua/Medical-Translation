<dc:description xml:lang="en">Staphylococcus sp was investigated in the female lower genital tract of 102 healthy women aged between 18 and 48 years in San Luis, Argentina. Three hundred and six samples were obtained from labia, introitus and vagina (posterior fornix). Samples were plated on sheep blood, mannitol salt and Baird-Parker media. Strains were identified by tube coagulase test; thermonuclease, fibrinolysin, pigment and hemolysin production; glucose and mannitol utilization and novobiocin sensitivity. Antibiotic susceptibility was assayed. Strains were examined for their ability to produce staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). Fourteen women (13.7%) had S. aureus in one or more samples: 10.7% labia, 3.9% introitus and 3.9% vaginal. All strains were sensitive to cephalotin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamycin and chloramphenicol; 21.0% were intermediate to methicillin; 15.7% were resistant to methicillin, 94.7% to penicillin and 21.0% to tetracycline. Three strains (15.7%) produced SEB, three (15.7%) SED, one (5.7%) SEC and three (15.7%) TSST-1. Only one strain (5.7%) produced both SEB and TSST-1. All strains produced hemolysins. Coagulase negative staphylococci were found in 40.1% of vaginal samples: S. epidermidis (32.2%) and S. saprophyticus (9.8%) were identified.</dc:description>
