<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Diabetes has demonstrated an epidemic behavior in Mexico, which is among the top countries with the highest number of patients with diabetes. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Mexico City and its relation with some cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 1,772 adults of both genders, aged 25 to 64 years, were randomly selected. Type 2 diabetes and impaired fasting glucose prevalence were estimated as well as its relation with some cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, abdominal obesity and the common carotid artery intima-media thickness. RESULTS The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 9.7% in women and 8.0% in men. An age effect was evident. The proportion of patients who were unaware of having diabetes was 26%. The main risk factors related to diabetes were age, abdominal obesity, hypertension, low high-density cholesterol lipoproteins (HDL-c) and hypertriglyceridemia. Metabolic control was low. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Mexico is high and is a major health problem. Its close relation with cardiovascular risk factors demand health policies aimed to diminish risk factors related to its occurrence.</dc:description>
