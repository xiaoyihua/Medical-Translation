<dc:description xml:lang="en">Eighty four cases of meningococcal infections are reviewed. Fifty seven cases presented themselfs as meningococcal meningitis, twelve cases as sepsis with moderate hypotension and 15 cases were sepsis with septic shock. A brief course of the disease, shock, echymosis, absence of meningeal signs, leucopenia and intravascular coagulation were findings more frequent in the group of patients with hiperacute sepsis, whereas other signs as fever, headaches, vomiting and petechiae were present with equal frequency in the three groups. N. meningitis was isolated in 73% of the cases. Shock (18.85%) and intravascular coagulation (12%) were the complications more frequently found, followed by convulsions (4.81%), arthritis (4.81%), skin necrosis (4.81%), subdural efusion (3.57%), cerebral palsy (3.40%), thrombophlebitis (1.20%), recurrence (1.20%), inapropiate antidiuretic hormone secretion (1.20%) and subaracnoideal hemorrage (1.20%). The overall mortality was 10.70% and 60% of the patients which initially presented with shock and intravascular coagulation died. Autopsy findings included wide spred hemorragic lesions and intravascular thrombi in skin, mucous membranes and viscera. Adrenal hemorrhage was present in five of the six cases studied.</dc:description>
