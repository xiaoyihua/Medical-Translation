<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hepatitis B (HVB) is a worldwide spread health problem. It has been assessed that there are more than 300 millions of carriers. HVB has a special concern for health care workers (HCW's) due to the high risk among them of getting the infection in clinic-setting areas. According to some estimation, the risk for hepatitis B among HCW's is 2 to 10 times higher than the risk for general population. The risk is related to the degree of direct contact with blood and body fluids, as well as, with the frequency of traumatic exposure in the work place. The control of this infection is based on the observance of universal precautions and the vaccination, since there is not treatment against this disease. The results of an efficacy-evaluation of DNA recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B are reported; 174 HCW's were studied; three dosages of vaccine were administered (0.1st and 6th month) by I.M. via. In addition, three serum samples were collected at 0, 1st and 9th month after vaccine administration. We did not find carriers of surface antigen of hepatitis B. With regards to seroconverted individuals we observed the following results: there were a satisfactory response to the vaccine in 163 individuals (93.7%); however, 8 (4.6%) persons did not reach titles of protective antibodies and 3 (1.7%) did not show seroconversion at all. Therefore, 11 persons (6.3% of the total) did not result immunized. The secondary reactions to the vaccines were low in frequency and mainly of local presentation. Among the study population we did not find chronic carries of hepatitis B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
