<dc:description xml:lang="en">This text analyzes the evolution of the excessive food energy supply in Mexico from 1990 to 2013. For each year, the energy and macronutrient requirements of the Mexican population were estimated and contrasted with the per capita energy supply. Discrepancies between requirement and supply were analyzed as a time series. The energy surplus ranged from 700 to 800 kcal per capita per day throughout the studied period and sugar/sweeteners contributed the highest above-requirement energy supply. Lipids excess increased steadily and intensely, mainly due to lipid increases from poultry and pork. Excess energy from alcoholic beverages tended to be concentrated into growing beer consumption. In summary, the energy supply and the corresponding surplus tended to be made up mainly of sugar/sweeteners and meat. This has direct implications for the prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases as well as unsustainable use of land, water and energy.</dc:description>
