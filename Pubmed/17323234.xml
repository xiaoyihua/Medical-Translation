<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Urinary symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are minor but disabling. We have analyzed correlation of urinary symptoms with motor symptoms, duration and severity of PD and urodynamic abnormalities observed. Response to treatment with tolterodine was also assessed. METHODS PD male patients with a score in IPSS questionnaire over 7 and female patients with a score in IU-4 scale over 5 were included in the study. Intensity of neurological symptoms (UPDRS score), seriousness of PD (Hohen-Yahr stage), urodynamic parameters, and urinary sediment were analyzed in each patient. Abdominal ultrasonography and rectal examination were performed in males to exclude obstructive prostatic pathology. Patients without evidence of urinary flow obstruction were treated with tolterodine. RESULTS Three out of the 19 patients were excluded because of abnormal urinary sediment and the rest (n = 16) were included. Urinary symptoms correlated with rigidity severity (p &lt; 0.01) and years of evolution of PD (p &lt; 0.01). Rigidity (p &lt; 0.01) was the neurological sign with the highest UPDRS motor scale score. Overactive bladder was present in 13 cases (81.2%) and 4 of them had urinary flow obstruction. Clinical improvement in nine patients treated with tolterodine was mild (33%). CONCLUSIONS Urinary symptoms correlate with rigidity severity and with years of evolution of PD. The use of both the urinary questionnaire and urodynamic study allow us to identify the type of bladder dysfunction and select the patients who would benefit the most from anticholinergics. Tolterodine reduced miccional urgency and frequency in PD, but was ineffective on urinary incontinence.</dc:description>
