<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in children was assessed by RT-nested PCR of the 5'untranslated region (5'UTR) of the viral genome combined with virus genotyping, performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). We analysed HCV infection in 64 children and in 9 HCV chronically infected mothers corresponding to 10 of them. Thirty two children were positive for serum HCV RNA as determined by RT-nested PCR. The viremia was analysed in consecutive samples of 25 children. Nine children (36%) were always positive for HCV RNA, in 5 (20%) a positive RT-nested PCR turned negative in subsequent samples, other 9 (36%) showed alternating RT-nested PCR results and in 2 (8%) the RT-nested PCR turned positive after an initial negative result. The HCV genotype distribution was studied in 27/32 children and in 9 mothers, and it was similar to that reported in the literature for adult and pediatric patients in our country. Genotype 1 was predominant in our population. HCV genotype did not change in the same patient during the time of this study. HCV genotype was the same in mother-infant pairs. We could not establish a correlation between HCV genotype and vertical transmission of HCV. This study will be helpful to further analyze HCV behavior during pediatric infection and the host's response in the initial stages of it.</dc:description>
