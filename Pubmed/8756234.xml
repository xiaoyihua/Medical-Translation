<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine whether provision of an information sheet during the preanesthesia visit to the patient, and general recommendations for anesthesia, can change patients' image of the anesthesiologist. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two groups of 100 patients each were studied before outpatient surgery. Group 1 (given no information) answered a questionnaire before an interview with the anesthesiologist. Group 2 (who were given information) answered the same questionnaire, which was accompanied by an information sheet explaining the nature of anesthesia, possible risks, operating room and postoperative procedures. RESULTS In group 1,67% identified the anesthesiologist as a physician. In group 2, 99% (p &lt; 0.05) were able to do so. In group 1, 48% believed that the anesthesiologist works under the surgeon's orders, while only 27% (p &lt; 0.05) thought so in group 2. The chief of the postanesthesia intensive care unit was thought to be a member of the nursing staff by 48% in group 1, whereas 95% (p &lt; 0.05) in group 2 identified the chief as an anesthesiologist. CONCLUSIONS The image of anesthesiology and the anesthesiologist can be improved by systematically providing an information sheet to patients who are scheduled for presurgical study.</dc:description>
