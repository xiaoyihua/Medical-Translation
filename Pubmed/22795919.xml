<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The fate of manuscripts submitted and subsequently rejected by Spanish-language journals is unknown. The present study was designed to determine whether or not articles submitted to Neurología are published following rejection, and if so, where. METHODS We searched Medline in late April 2012 and also analysed all manuscripts rejected by Neurología between October 2004 and April 2012 according to that journal's two databases. In that period, 1277 articles were submitted to the journal. RESULTS Of the 271 manuscripts rejected by Neurología, 54 articles (19.9%) were published in other journals. Neurology journals published 31 of the manuscripts (57.4%); 43 manuscripts (79.6%) appeared in Spanish-language journals. Of the rejected manuscripts, 24.1% of the originals, 8.3% of the letters to the editor, 28.9% of the case reports, 22.6% of the reviews and 6.3% of the images were published. Authors with three previously published articles on the same topic managed to publish their manuscripts in 34% of the cases, compared to only 11.8% of authors with fewer published articles (P &lt; .0001). Of the total manuscripts rejected between 2004 and 2010, 24.8% were eventually published. The median time lapse between article submission and publication was 13 months (range, 2-59 months). CONCLUSION Manuscripts rejected by Neurología are often published in other journals, but this scenario is not as common as in English-language journals. In the case of Neurología, the editor's decision to reject an article is more significant than it would be in an English-language journal because the author will have fewer additional possibilities of having the manuscript published.</dc:description>
