<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the suitability of a questionnaire designed to assess the knowledge of patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation, through a pilot study. METHOD A descriptive study of the construction of a knowledge questionnaire for patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation. This study was developed in the liver pre-transplant clinic of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona from October 2011 to April 2012. An initial questionnaire was designed. This draft was improved following the recommendations of experts in liver transplantation, and after the completion of a preliminary test. The questionnaire obtained was applied to 25 patients in the pilot study. The quality of the questions was measured using the discrimination index and the index of attraction. The construct was assessed by principal component analysis and factor analysis. RESULTS The questionnaire consisted of 36 items (questions). Of these, 31 are independent. The discrimination index identified only 4 questions with a good (desired information ai=.30) and very good (list exclusion ai=.40, list and time on list ai=.58) level of discrimination. The remaining questions had a poor or insufficient level of discrimination (ai&lt;29). The principal component analysis and factor analysis indicated that the questions related to the disease (10) and the waiting list (4) were essential in the questionnaire, and the questions related to demographic data (7) and the therapeutic regimen (8) should be eliminated. CONCLUSIONS The questionnaire obtained needs to be modified to assess the knowledge of patients on waiting list for liver transplantation.</dc:description>
