<dc:description xml:lang="en">Forty healthy females, 18 to 65 years, undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic uterine curettage were studied with the purpose of comparing anesthetic characteristics of thiopental and propofol as induction agents. They were randomly allocated in two groups: A propofol induction group (2.5 mg/kg), and a thiopental induction group (4-5 mg/kg). Fentanyl (2 micrograms/kg), was administered 2 minutes before anaesthesia, and N2O/O2 (66%/33%) by mask was maintained during surgery. Changes in systolic and diastolic BP were not significantly different in two groups. The HR decreased more significantly in the propofol group (20% vs 10%; p less than 0.005). Apnea was significantly greater in the propofol group, in term of incidence (50% vs 15%; p = 0.025), and duration (92 seg vs 17 seg; p = 0.20). The lapses of time to opening the eyes and response to a command were not significantly different, but the time to be able to seat was significantly lower in the propofol group (12 min vs 21 min; p = 0.0003). Anaesthesia was clinically satisfactory for most patients in both treatment groups.</dc:description>
