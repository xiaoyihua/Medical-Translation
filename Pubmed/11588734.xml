<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION This paper was designed to evaluate the integral rehabilitation treatments for patients with traumatic brain injury; data about efficiency of the C.RE.CER. intensive, holistic and multidisciplinary rehabilitation program is given. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study was done keeping in mind not only the clinical aspects of rehabilitation, but also setting it within the judicial realm in which a great number of brain injury cases are found, mainly when caused by traffic accidents. A sample of 10 severe traumatic brain injury patients was studied, aged between 19 and 39. All the patients were assessed at the beginning and the end of the treatment, using a neuropsychological test battery, meanwhile were treated with the C.RE.CER. intensive, holistic and multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The results show a high efficiency of treatments in the majority of the patients, with reductions of more than 70% in emotional deficits and more than 60% in the global recovery of the patients that carried out the programs. This paper also shows some limitations of the criteria for compensation in Spanish legislation.</dc:description>
