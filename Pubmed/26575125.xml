<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify the meaning that the families of two pregnant women from Antioquia placed on their suicide in 2010-2011. METHODOLOGY A qualitative research using the phenomenological and hermeneutical approach, specifically a case study analysis. RESULTS The category named "family task: weaving a history that helps them to understand" emerged in both families. Two trends were found in the family of Bella: "tragedy, tensions and scenarios" and "fluctuations: between fear-guilt and relief." The family of Consentida showed three trends: "trapped with no escape", "suicide and orphanhood: the understanding of Juanita" and "death is death." CONCLUSIONS For both families, the fact that the women were pregnant had an important effect on the event of voluntary death. The construction of meaning that took place in both families followed two paths: differentiation and death itself; both can be resilient ways of coping with such a tragedy.</dc:description>
