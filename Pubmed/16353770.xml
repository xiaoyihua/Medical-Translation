<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder represents a disease of entire urothelial tract. The follow up is very important to detect any lesion that might represent a progression or a local recurrence. Some authors recommend randomized biopsies as a routine workup, others recommend cystoscopies and urinary cytology as the main part of superficial bladder cancer follow up. PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty nine patients with superficial bladder cancer were followed up during a ten-year period. Randomized biopsies and urinary cytology were harvested according to the international cancer protocol on bladder cancer. RESULTS 15 (1%) out of 1.489 randomized biopsies found to be positive to transitional cell carcinoma. Four out (10.5%) of 35 biopsies targeted to suspicious areas were positive to transitional cell carcinoma. 50 (17.4%) out of 288 cystoscopies with urinary cytology found to be positive to transitional cell carcinoma. Sensitivity and Specificity of biopsies (including randomized and targeted) were 31% and 85.2% respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of cystoscopies with urinary cytology were 48% and 86.5% respectively. CONCLUSION Randomized biopsies did not show to detect more local recurrence or progression when compared to the urinary cytology. Cystoscopies with urinary cytology have good sensitivity and specificity for detection of tumor recurrence during follow up of transitional cell carcinoma.</dc:description>
