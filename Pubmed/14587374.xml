<dc:description xml:lang="en">The ability of the API 20 NE method (6.0 version, bio-Mérieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France) to identify 188 strains of gram negative nonfermentative bacilli (NFB) was evaluated (Fenazinic pigment producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. were excluded). These were isolated from patients treated at the Hospital de Clínicas José de San Martín of the University of Buenos Aires during the period 1996-2001. Strains were identified according to the Schreckenberger P testing method. Out of 188 NFB strains, 175 (93.09%) were correctly identified by the API 20 NE method at the genus and species level (IC95 = 88.47-96.27) while 61 (32.45%) required additional testing for correct identification. Thirteen strains (6.91%; IC95 3.73-11.53) could not be correctly identified and none of them were classified as "non identified". The API 20 NE method is a practical, easy to handle, fast and useful system for the identification of NFB since conventional manual methods take longer and require many biochemical, enzymatic and physiological tests which are sometimes not available depending on the size and capability of the laboratory. Although it is easy to handle, the API 20 NE identification system must be interpreted by an expert microbiologist who must compare the results obtained by this system with the information provided by the distinctive cultures and mobility patterns of these organisms.</dc:description>
