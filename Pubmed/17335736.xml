<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE To assess an intensive proactive telephone smoking cessation program and compare it with a similar group in face to face treatment. DESIGN A prospective, controlled, observational study performed during daily clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS 383 smokers, 176 in telephone treatment and 207 in face to face group treatment, aged greater than 18 years old. They smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day and both groups were recruited between April and November 2003. The study was performed between April 2003 and May 2004. Treatment technique: 11 congnitive-behavioral interventions for six months plus 24 hour nicotine patches in standard doses and 2 mg nicotine gum on demand. Main variable: Prolonged abstinence self-professed at 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 12, weeks, 16 weeks, 20 weeks and 24 weeks. RESULTS In the first and second week, abstinence was significantly higher in the face to face group than in telephone treatment (1st. week 80.2% vs. 65.9% p = .001; 2nd. week 77.3% vs 65.3% p = .007). Subsequently, the difference was not significant, and at 24 weeks abstinence remained similar for the two treatment methods, 54.6% in the face to face group treatment and 54.5% in telephone treatment. CONCLUSIONS Intensive smoking cessation treatment programs, with nicotine replacement therapy, are equally effective if performed by proactive telephone or in face to face treatment sessions.</dc:description>
