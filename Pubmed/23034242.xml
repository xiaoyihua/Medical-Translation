<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Functional impairment has been repeatedly reported in patients with bipolar disorder even during clinical remission. Less is known about specific domains, such as interpersonal relationships. The aim of this study was to identify clinical predictors of poor interpersonal relationships. METHODS Using a specific subscale of the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST), we assessed the interpersonal relationships of a sample of 71 euthymic bipolar (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D] &lt; 8; Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] &lt; 5) patients. The sample was divided into two categories: low vs. high level functioning in interpersonal relationships according to the median of the sample. Multivariate analyses were applied to identify significant predictors of interpersonal functioning. RESULTS Age (p=0.026), the number of previous depressive and mixed episodes and HAM-D scores differed significantly between the two groups (p&lt;0.05). For manic episodes, only a tendency was detected (p=0.064). After running multivariate analyses, age (p=0.026), depressive symptoms (p=0.055) and the number of previous manic episodes (p=0.033) could be considered predictors of poor interpersonal functioning. The model predicted 83.3% of the variance (R=0.59; gl=1; p&lt;0.001). DISCUSSION Our results indicate a link between greater impairment in interpersonal relationships and being older and having more residual symptoms and a higher number of previous manic episodes. Patients with these features should be carefully monitored and specific psychosocial interventions should be implemented to improve their outcome.</dc:description>
