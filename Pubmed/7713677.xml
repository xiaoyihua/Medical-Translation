<dc:description xml:lang="en">To assess the importance of travelling for abortion in Spanish women from 1974 to 1988, a descriptive epidemiologic study was undertaken, based on information from the United Kingdom Office for Population Censuses and Surveys. Additionally, the effect of the democratic restitution in Spain (1978) and of the passing of the Spanish abortion law in Spain is explored. During the study period, close to 200,000 Spanish women travelled to England and Wales to have an abortion. The annual figures range from 2,978 in 1974 to 22,002 in 1983. In 1988, in spite of the partial decriminalization of abortion in Spain, still 3,188 travelled to the UK for an abortion. In average, 1 out 35 Spanish women in fertile ages travelled to England and Wales for this reason in the study period. The likelihood was higher for the cohort of women born between 1955 and 1959, for which the risk was 4.5%. The proportional distribution by age shows that teenagers increased their relative importance from 9.3% in 1974 to 17% in 1988, suggesting less benefits for this age group than for older women from the democratization of the country and the abortion law.</dc:description>
