<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the changes in dental caries prevalence and severity, in a group of primary schoolchildren. Two dental caries surveys were carried out, one in 1984 and the other in 1992. MATERIAL AND METHODS The dental caries indices were registered using the World Health Organization's criteria. A group of 6-7 years old schoolchildren living in the East Region of Xochimilco were included in the study. A total of 279 children participated in this study; 153 in 1984 and 126 in 1992. RESULTS The mean value of the deft index was 5.65 (SD 3.35) in 1984, and the mean value of the deft index was 4.89 (SD 3.7) in 1992. For the permanent dentition the DMFT was 0.51 (SD 1.0) in 1984 and 0.48 (SD 0.82) in 1992. Differences in dental caries indices, between the first and second survey, were significant only for the primary dentition in the six years old group (95% CI 0.36, 2.15). An increase in the proportion of filled teeth was found. However, the treatment needs are still very high (69% for primary teeth and 86% for permanent teeth). CONCLUSIONS The findings from this study seem to indicate little change in the prevalence and severity of dental caries in the population in the period of study.</dc:description>
