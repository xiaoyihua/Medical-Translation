<dc:description xml:lang="en">The role of the amino-terminal fragment of probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in monitoring the clinical status of outpatients with chronic heart failure has not yet been fully established. Fifty-nine patients with chronic heart failure were followed up at an outpatient clinic. The serum NT-proBNP level was measured and clinical status was assessed according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and Framingham clinical criteria. A positive correlation was found between the NT-proBNP level, NYHA functional class and Framingham score (P&lt;.001). Patients who presented with a Framingham score &gt; 2 were more likely to be readmitted to hospital (31.8% vs. 0%; P&lt;.001), to visit an emergency department (36.4% vs. 5.4%; P=.002), or to die (13.6% vs. 0%; P=.021). The NT-proBNP level was higher in patients who needed to be readmitted to hospital (P=.004) and in those who attended an emergency department for decompensation (P=.002) (AU)</dc:description>
