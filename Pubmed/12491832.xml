<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In children, urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common disease, and can cause permanent kidney damage. AIM To determine risk factors for permanent kidney damage, in children with UTI. PATIENTS AND METHODS In 337 children with UTI (237 female, mean age 4.2 years) a static renal scintigraphy was performed to assess the presence of permanent kidney damage. The history of vesicoureteral reflux and number of episodes of UTI was obtained. RESULTS One hundred three children had a history of one episode of infection and the rest had recurrent infections. Permanent kidney damage was observed in 161 children (48%). This damage was observed in 39% of children of less than one year of age, in 43% of children aged 1 to 5 years of age and in 58% of children older than 5 years (p = 0.02). Sixty three percent of 122 children with vesicoureteral reflux had permanent kidney damage, compared with 27% of children without this condition (p &lt; 0.001). Likewise, damage was observed in 36% of children with one episode of infection and 47% of children with recurrent infections (p &lt; 0.01). No gender differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS Vesicoureteral reflux, recurrence of UTI and age are associated with permanent renal damage in children with UTI.</dc:description>
