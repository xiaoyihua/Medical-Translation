<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Salivary Streptococci mutans contamination is considered the main microbiological risk factor for the initiation of caries. AIM To assess the oral health of pregnant women, counting Salivary Streptococci mutants. PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred seventy four pregnant women, in the first, second and third trimester of pregnancy, aged 27 +/- 5 years old, consulting at a public primary health center, were studied. Puerperal women that had their delivery two months before, were studied as a control group. Salivary samples were obtained and Streptococci mutans colonies were counted using quantitative and semiquantitative methods. RESULTS There was a good concordance between both counting methods. No differences in Streptococci mutans counts were observed among the three groups of pregnant women, but the latter as a group had higher counts than puerperal women. Women with more than 5 caries had also higher counts. CONCLUSIONS Semiquantitative Streptococci mutans counts are easy, rapid and non invasive and have a good concordance with quantitative counts in saliva.</dc:description>
