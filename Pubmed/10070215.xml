<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To study the prevalence of risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) in university students between 17 an 19 years of age. METHODS A sample of 289 first year students, 144 females and 145 males, of the University of Costa Rica were included for anthropometric, biochemical and physical studies. RESULTS One in six (17% N = 48) had total cholesterol &gt; 200 mg/dL and it was more frequent in females. High LDL-C &gt; 130 mg/dL was found in 26% (N = 74) whereas low HDL-C was present in only 42% (N = 121). Nearly 10% (N = 28) smoked and 38% (N = 111) did not exercise. Obesity was seen in 7% (N = 20) when the Body Mass Index was used as a criterium but only 1.4% (N = 4) by body fat. The distribution of risk factors was: one factor in 36% (N = 105), two factors in 27% (N = 77) and three or more in 13% (N = 37). The most common were sedentarism, dislipedemias and smoking. CONCLUSIONS CHD risk factors were present in many of our adolescents. Our finding suggests the need to promote healthier lifestyles to minimize the potential of these factors to cause CHD in adulthood.</dc:description>
