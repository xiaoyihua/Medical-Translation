<dc:description xml:lang="en">The present work describes the process by which the pilot project of clinical management of the Hospital Complex Juan Canalejo, designated as "Heart Area", was implemented. In the first section, the needs and reasons that led to the undertaking of this project are explained. The project's objectives and operative strategies are listed. In the Material and Methods section, three basic aspects of the "Heart Area" are described: selection criteria of the "Area", its structure and function, and its foundation and development. In the Results section, we compare the activity undertaken in the "Area" to the situation present prior to its implementation, in relation to quality and costs. Finally, in the Conclusions, we comment on the important implications that our project can have within the Hospital Complex Juan Canalejo as well as in the health care field in general.</dc:description>
