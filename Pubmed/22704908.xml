<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Being born small for gestational age (SGA) has short and long term risks. The aim of this study was to describe perinatal and socio-cultural characteristics, and the pattern of growth and diet of SGA infants during their first 6 months of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS Anthropometry and diet were evaluated during six months in a representative sample of 1596 newborns the population of Aragon (Spain). RESULTS Mothers of SGA (N=94) infants gained less weight during pregnancy (10.5±5.8 vs 12.0±5.07 kg, P=.012), gestational age at birth was lower (37.84±1.7 vs 39.06±1.6 weeks, P&lt;.001), and the probability of cesarean delivery was higher (37.2% vs 20.5%, P=.001). The height of the mother was lower in the SGA group (1.61±0.58 vs 1.63±0.06 metres, P=.004), but their body mass index was similar. No differences were found between groups in social or cultural aspects. Mothers of SGA infants smoked more during pregnancy (32.3% vs 18.5%, P=.003) (RR = 1.92; 95% CI; 1.31 to 3.02). Infants born SGA remained smaller during the first 6 months of life, and the monthly weight gain was similar to the rest. In the SGA group, the prevalence of breastfeeding was lower at 4 months of age (54.9% vs 68.2%, RR = 0.58, 95% CI; 0.38 to 0.89). CONCLUSIONS Infants born SGA are more likely to converge a number of characteristics that must be considered together because they may lead to health risks. SGA do not show a rapid recovery pattern of postnatal growth, and their smaller size persists at six months.</dc:description>
