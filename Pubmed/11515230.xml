<dc:description xml:lang="en">Zinc is an essential element, important for early growth and development, and immune competence, which deficiency might be especially critical in preterm infants. Since published data have shown that some preterm milks have abnormally low zinc values, we decided to measure zinc levels in term and preterm milk, in order to assess if they were within normal values and if there were differences between both groups. Samples from 24 preterm and 20 term mothers (mean gestational age, 30.9 + 0.5 and 39.5 + 0.2 weeks, respectively) were collected and kept at -20 degrees C until analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, prior wet ashing with nitric acid. Both term and preterm milk showed zinc values within normal levels. No significant differences were registered between them. A decreasing trend was observed along time, which was significant between colostrum and mature milk samples (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05). In the term group, zinc concentrations in colostrum and mature milk (microgram/mL) (mean +/- SEM) varied between 6.96 +/- 0.69 y 2.44 +/- 0.11, while in the preterm group the values were 6.20 +/- 0.89 y 2.28 +/- 0.54. According to our results, zinc values in human milk were comparable between preterm and term mothers.</dc:description>
