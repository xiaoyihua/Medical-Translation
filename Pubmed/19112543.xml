<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the usefulness of endoscopic assisted surgery of pituitary adenomas in transesphenoidal surgery, and in surgery of craneopharyngiomas using either minimally invasive approaches to the cranial base or transventricular approaches. MATERIAL AND METHODS We present our preliminary experience in eleven patients operated of sellar region tumor by endoscopic assisted resection: 6 pituitary adenoma via transesphenoidal approach, 4 craneopharyngiomas 3 through supraciliar approach and 1 by transcortical transventricular approach, and 1 suprasellar cyst. RESULTS By using the 30 degrees optic the use of endoscope allowed complete resection, confirmed by postoperative MRI, of all six pituitary macroadenomas providing control of resection of supraselar remnants. Complete resection was achieved in three out of four craneopharyngiomas, 2 of them being recurrences. Three were operated by using a supraciliar approach to the cranial base and in one case transcortical transventricular resection of a recurrent intraventricular craneopharyngioma was performed. In the case with partial resection remnant were let in place due to the close adherence to peritumoral structures. In the three craneopharyngiomas operated via supraciliar approach endoscope allowed better control of inferior aspect of ipsilateral optic nerve and internal carotid artery. In the case of intraventricular craneopharyngioma, the use of 30 degrees endoscope provide control of resection of the anterior part of third ventricle through the foramen of Monro with no additional opening. The suprasellar cyst was fenestrated. CONCLUSIONS No matter which approach is going to be used in the resection of sellar tumors, endoscopy can play a crucial role in achieve complete resection with minimal morbidity by using minimally invasive procedures.</dc:description>
