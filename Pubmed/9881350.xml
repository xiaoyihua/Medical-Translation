<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Cytogenetic studies of meningiomas suggest that loss of (or parts of) chromosome 22 is a primary event in the development of these tumors; later on, other chromosomal changes would occur in the caryotypes. All these secondary changes are observed mainly in cases with high clinical aggressivity. However, in a few cases of meningiomas disomy 22 coexists, but with other chromosomic anomalies. We present clinical, histopathological and cytogenetic findings in a group of meningiomas with disomy of chromosome 22. PATIENTS AND METHODS We collected 10 meningiomas from nine patients which ages ranged between 28-70 years. Fresh tumoral specimens were divided for histologic examination and cytogenetic study, performed after short-term culture. RESULTS At microscopic examination 5 tumors were classified as benign meningiomas, four as atypical and one as malignant meningioma. Four cases were recurrent tumors. The cytogenetic studies showed that all tumors presented two chromosomes 22 and other chromosome abnormalities. Losses in chromosomes 4, 7, 10, 14, 16, 17 and 20 were frequent; cytogenetics rearrangements of chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 7, 14, 19 and 22 were frequently involved. CONCLUSIONS In karyotypic evolution of meningiomas, secondary anomalies of chromosomes 1p, 10 and 14 are the most common and appear to be associated with a more aggressive clinical course. In this group of meningiomas with disomy 22, these anomalies were also frequently found, and were related in 50% of cases with atypical or malignant morphologies and of them with recurrent tumors in the 40%.</dc:description>
