<dc:description xml:lang="en">This descriptive study presents a series of factors that can influence food habits, being the educational level the most important independent variable. The sample included families that had infants (1-2 years) and preschool children (2-6 years). These families belonged to all socio-economic levels, not being well represented the very high and the very low levels. The results are presented individually by food groups and by a sequence of factors that could influence the food consumption behaviour. From the results one can observe that there is a great need of nutrition education to affirm and modify some habits and create others. This could be of great value for the general population.</dc:description>
