<dc:description xml:lang="en">Statins are becoming one of the drugs used most for cardiovascular prevention. Given the age of the patients admitted to the intensive medicine units, many of them receive previous treatment with statins. However, after admission to these units, statin treatment is generally discontinued. There are no important studies that evaluate the effect of discontinuing statins on mortality. However, the existing studies support the hypothesis that withdrawing statins has a clear harmful effect. Thus, the withdrawal of statins after admission to an intensive medicine unit should be carefully evaluated.</dc:description>
