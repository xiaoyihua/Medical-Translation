<dc:description xml:lang="en">The present article describes the activity performed by the medical support services and, more specifically, by operational services (which include mainly cleaning, laundry, and non-patient transport) and catering. We outline the normal activity of these services and then provide details of how they were affected on 11 March and subsequent days. Data relating to the Rehabilitation Centers and Ophthalmology Institute are not included as they were not significantly affected from the point of view discussed herein.</dc:description>
