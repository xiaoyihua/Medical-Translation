<dc:description xml:lang="en">Results of 12 late synovectomies in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) (6 knees, 5 wrists, 1 hip), have been evaluated. Synovectomies we performed in 5 patients with 7 to 11 years of evolution and with advanced joint lesions at the X-rays. Pain and inflammation disappeared in all synovectomized joints, but one year later the range of motion was slightly decreased in most of them. In the operated hip, the extent of motions decreased at first, but 6 years later it worked better than the opposite. It is concluded that synovectomy in JRA is useful, even with advanced joint lesions. For best results, present day criteria is to perform synovectomy early in the course of the disease.</dc:description>
