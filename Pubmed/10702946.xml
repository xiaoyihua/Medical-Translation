<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To asses if the hot flushes during the menopause are associated to alterations in the metabolism of nitric oxide, total antioxidant activity and other biochemical parameters. To evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the metabolism of nitric oxide, total antioxidant activity and biochemistry in menopausal women with and without hot flushes. PATIENTS AND METHODS Experimental study. This study included 29 healthy menopausal women with hot flushes (12 with HRT) and 20 without them (6 with HRT), 45-55 years old, with duration of menopause ranging from 1 to 5 years. Control group included 14 fertile women. Determinations of estradiol, nitrite-nitrate, total antioxidant activity and basic analytic, were performed before previous and after 4-6 month of HRT therapy. RESULTS Previously to HRT, hot flushes were associated to smaller level of total antioxidant activity (p &lt; 0.05) in plasma, without differences in nitrite-nitrate concentrations. HRT was associated to increase in total antioxidant activity level and nitrite-nitrate concentrations (p &lt; 0.05) in menopausal women, with and without hot flushes. CONCLUSIONS Hot flushes during the menopause indicate a high level of oxidative stress and a higher cardiovascular risk. HRT decreased the oxidative stress level and increased the nitric oxide derivate metabolites in menopausal women with and without hot flushes.</dc:description>
