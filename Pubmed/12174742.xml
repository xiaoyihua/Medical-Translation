<dc:description xml:lang="en">Presentation of results and complications obtained in 360 procedures of transuretral ureterorenoscopy (URS) in ureteral lithiasis performed in our unit from january 1990 to august 2000 in 354 patients: 55% female and 45% male. A rigid ureteroscopy Storz 10.5 Ch. was used and intracorporeal lithotripsy was necessary in 17.31% of cases. URS indications were always treatment of ureteral lithiasis, pelvic ureter localization in most cases (70.33%) being 93.05% the percentage of overall success and with a significant decrease when the calculus was located in the upper third of the ureter. Serious complications were only 3.05% of cases and endoscopic surgery was necessary in three cases of ureteral stenosis. In our experience, URS is our technique of choice for treatment of lower and medium third of the ureter where the percentage of success we have obtained were 98.99% and 95.83% respectively.</dc:description>
