<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In this report we inform laboratory results accumulated over ten years (1986-1995). The number of cases, and the geographic distribution, allow us to present a very reliable data about the dimension of Chlamydia trachomatis urogenital infections in Buenos Aires city and we also compare this profile with the prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the same area and period of time. METHODS Patients were females and males (aged from 15 to 49 years old) attending clinics not specialize in Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD). Intent to isolation of C. trachomatis was done in McCoy cells culture. Patients for Neisseria gonorrhoeae investigation were a population assisted at the Clinic for STD of an University Hospital (aged from 15 to 75 years old). Study for detection of N. gonorrhoeae was developed by direct and conventional culture technics. RESULTS 4128 endocervical samples from women with lower genital tract pathology were studied and C. trachomatis infection was detected in 25.6 +/- 4.8%. Over 1206 male urethral samples 29.5 +/- 4.47% shows positive cultures. Except for years 1989 and 1990 in which annual percentage of infected women showed slightly higher percentage over the global average, the results shows a very stable annual values, as it was also found in male patients. Infection in males shows a discrete tendency to be higher compare with values obtained in women. Global results of the evolution of prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae infection shows a very different pattern. Since 1992 we demonstrate a very significant decrease in the number of confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS We concluded that patients not attending a STD clinic, reveal a high and very stable endemic level of C. trachomatis lower tract urogenital infections. N. gonorrhoeae in this population is a very sporadic or null finding. Prevalence of Chlamydial infection in STD centers is even higher and also shows an stable profile. In people attending STD clinics N. gonorrhoeae shows a very different kinetics, with an important decrease in prevalence in the last five years.</dc:description>
