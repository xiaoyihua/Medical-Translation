<dc:description xml:lang="en">To review the causes of non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma treated surgically with the intention to cure, in order to determine and analyze the course of disease in our patients, particularly regarding survival after five years, and to compare our outcomes with those reported in the literature. Retrospective study of all patients resected in our unit from September 1984 through December 1990. We also analyze sex, age, and course of disease over a period of 60 months, emphasizing surgically related mortality, TNM stage, type of resection and tissue type. We calculated five year actuarial survival globally and for each variable studied, excluding patients who died as a result of surgery and those who were lost to follow-up. We identified 115 cases (13.62% of all patients under-going surgery during this period). Nine patients (7.82%) died after surgery. Six patients were lost to follow-up and for three patients data were incomplete. Fifty-three patients died within five years of surgery. Forty-four lived at least five years. Overall actuarial survival was 56.05%. Analyzing by TNM stages, 54.9% were stage I, 50% were stage II and 32.09% were stage IIIa. Pneumonectomy was performed on 43.59%, single or double lobectomy on 50.29%, and infralobar resection on 33.33% Histology revealed 54.56% to be epidermoid versus 33.01% for all other tissue types. The outcomes for bronchogenic carcinomas resected in our department are comparable to those in the literature, survival after five postoperative years being similar to the rate reported for other series.</dc:description>
