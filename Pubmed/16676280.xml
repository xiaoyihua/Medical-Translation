<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To review the neurochemical features and therapeutic options for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). DEVELOPMENT The main neurochemical alterations in FTD are the serotoninergic and dopamine depletion. In contrast with Alzheimer's and diffuse Lewy bodies disease, there are not significant alterations of the cholinergic system. Cerebral perfusion and glucose metabolism studies usually show hypoperfusion or hypometabolism, with predominant involvement of temporal and frontal cortices. There have been described some alterations related with oxidative stress and apoptosis, although its pathogenetic role in FTD is not well known. Treatment of FTD is not well established, because there are only a few studies with some drugs. The most studied drugs are serotonin reuptake inhibitors, however, despite the well-known serotoninergic deficiency described in FTD, the results are not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS The main neurochemical alterations of FTD are serotoninergic and dopaminergic deficiencies. The treatment is not well established, although it should be theoretically ideal to use drugs which modulate these neurotransmitter systems.</dc:description>
