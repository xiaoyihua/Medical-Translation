<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the validity and reproducibility of a self-reported questionnaire on physical activity and inactivity, developed for children aged 10-14 in Mexico City. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between May and December 1996, a self-reported physical activity and inactivity questionnaire was developed and applied twice to a sample of 114 students aged 10 to 14, from a low and middle income population of Mexico City. The children's mothers completed the same questionnaire, and two 24-hour recalls of physical activity were used for comparison. Statistical analysis consisted of central tendency and dispersion measures and Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS Correlations between hours per day spent in physical activity and inactivity from the children's questionnaire and the 24-hour recall data, were 0.03 for moderate activity, 0.15 for vigorous activity, and 0.51 (p = 0.001) for watching television, adjusted by age, gender, town, and illness prior to the administration of the questionnaire. Compared to the 24-hour recall data, the questionnaire overestimated the time spent watching television, reading or participating in vigorous activity, and underestimated the time engaged in moderate activity. Statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) six-month reproducibility values were observed for watching television (r = 0.53), sleeping (r = 0.40), moderate (r = 0.38), and vigorous activity (r = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS Among children of Mexico City aged 10-14, the questionnaire showed acceptable validity in estimating the time watching television, and acceptable reproducibility of the time watching television, vigorous and moderate activity.</dc:description>
