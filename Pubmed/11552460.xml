<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Insulin resistance (IR) is a central metabolic alteration with impact in human reproduction giving rise to hyperandrogenism, infertility, acanthosis, perimenopausal autoimmunity, obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemias. Hence the estimation of insulin resistance is of clinical importance and we seeked to evaluate the correlation between two formulas (formula 1: glucose/insulin; formula 2: glucose x insulin/22.5) for its assessment. MATERIAL AND METHODS Glucose and insulin was measured to 66 females (age 18-66 years) in whom IR was suspected. RESULTS Mean age of patients was 23.9 +/- SD 10.9 year. IR was detected through the formulas used in 74%; the correlation coefficient (Pearson) was inversely proportional with both formulas (r = -460; p &lt; 0.02). More than 50% of patients with IR had family background of IR, 81% were obese and 74% had a waist-hip index &gt; 0.85 (central obesity or android), 52% hypercholesterolemia, 56% hypertriglyceridemia, 71% inverse relation of HDL/LDL, 45% had infertility, 71% hyperandrogenism, 65% polycystic ovaries and 4% presented diabetes. CONCLUSIONS Through the use of two arithmetical formulas we determined the presence of IR in 73% of patients studied albeit with proclivity to IR; the correlation between the two formulas was significant. A high association of obesity, infertility, hyperandorogenism and dyslipidemias with IR was also observed.</dc:description>
