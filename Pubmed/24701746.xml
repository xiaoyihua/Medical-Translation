<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical results and integrity of arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears using the suture bridge technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty-six shoulders with total thickness rotator cuff tears were assessed. Mean follow-up was 19 months. Repair integrity was analyzed postoperatively with imaging and recovery times. RESULTS The University of California at Los Angeles scale was used during the followup; the preoperative mean improved from 13.2 points to 29.7 (p\001). The rotator cuff healed completely in 66.7 of the 56 shoulders. The incidence of fatty regeneration of rotator cuff muscles was more common in individuals &gt; 60 years of age (p = 0.002). The latter had a higher chance of recurrent tear (p\001). DISCUSSION There was significant pain relief in the visual analogue scale and improvement in ranges of motion. The advantages of this technique include that it allows immobilizing with a sling without the need for maximum abduction protection; it is a safer repair due to the configuration of the double band intercrossed over the tendon that provides greater fixation and stability, with greater coverage of the tear defect.</dc:description>
