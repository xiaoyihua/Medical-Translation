<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION A series of quantitative scales have been established internationally to evaluate the functional state of patients affected by movement disorders, such as Parkinson s disease. The values of these parameters offered by each patient, measured at different moments during his or her illness, allow us to conduct studies into their evolution as well as perform statistical studies about the casuistics. AIM. To provide a tool that enables us to study this vast amount of material in an efficient, sure and, above all, automated manner. Materials and methods. We selected the most interesting variables from the international protocols. We also designed and developed a database application for use under the Windows environment using Delphi 3.0 language and compiler and Structured Query Language. RESULTS We designed, developed and validated a database system so as to be able to handle automatically the information on the clinical evolution of patients who had undergone functional neurosurgery. This system not only enables us to collect all relevant pre and post surgical information but also allows fast searches and selection, data processing using descriptive statistical techniques and the exportation of the data in a standard format. The system, which also allows final double blind clinical evaluation of each patient to be performed, has been used successfully in the Movement Disorders Clinic at the CIREN for over three years. CONCLUSIONS This system allows for a considerable saving in the amount of time and effort needed for the post surgical evolution of patients, while also increasing the reliability of the results obtained.</dc:description>
