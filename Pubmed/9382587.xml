<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The present study describes a case of the recently discovered chromophobe cell carcinoma of the kidney. Additional findings that have not been previously reported are presented and the importance of the clinical and anatomopathological diagnosis of this tumor type is underscored. METHODS The tumor presented in a 72-year-old female with symptoms and signs that were not distinct from those of other more common renal tumors. She underwent a right radical nephrectomy. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies were performed and the findings were compared with those reported in the literature. RESULTS The foregoing studies disclosed a chromophobe cell renal carcinoma, with some findings-chiefly ultrastructural-that have not been previously described. CONCLUSION Chromophobe cell renal carcinoma, a tumor type that has recently been identified, is the subject of several studies that have been conducted to permit its clinical and anatomopathological characterization. The present study describes some observations which, to our knowledge, have not been previously described elsewhere.</dc:description>
