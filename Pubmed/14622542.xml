<dc:description xml:lang="en">The results of the Registry of the Working Group on Cardiac Catheterization and Interventional Cardiology of the Spanish Society of Cardiology for 2002 are presented. Data were obtained from 101 centers representing all cardiac catheterization laboratories in Spain; 95 centers performed mainly adult catheterization and 6 carried out only pediatric procedures. In 2002, 97,609 diagnostic catheterization procedures were performed, including 83,667 coronary angiograms, representing a total increase of 5.1% in comparison to 2001. The population-adjusted rate was 2,053 coronary angiograms per 106 inhabitants. Coronary interventions increased by 11% in comparison to 2001, with a total of 34,723 procedures and a rate of coronary interventions of 850 per 106 inhabitants. Coronary stents were the devices used most frequently, with 47,249 implanted in 2002, for a total increase of 20% in comparison to 2001. Stenting accounted for 91.7% of all procedures. Direct stenting was done in 13 768 procedures (43.2%). IIb-IIIa glycoprotein inhibitors were used in 9966 procedures (28.7%). Multivessel percutaneous coronary interventions were performed in 9,830 patients (28%), and ad hoc interventions were done in the course of diagnostic coronary angiography in 26,341 patients (76%).A total of 4,766 percutaneous coronary interventions were done in patients with acute myocardial infarction, representing an increase of 23.9% in comparison to 2001, and accounting for 13.7% of all interventional procedures. Of the noncoronary interventions recorded, we note the decrease in percutaneous mitral valvuloplasties (21.2%) and atrial septal defect closures (11.1%), and the slight increase in pediatric interventions (3.7%). In conclusion, we emphasize the high rate of reporting by laboratories, which allows the Registry to compile data that are highly representative of the activity at cardiac catheterization laboratories in Spain</dc:description>
