<dc:description xml:lang="en">The speed of glomerular filtration (GFR) was studied in 16 healthy newborns and in 19 with idiopathic respiratory insufficiency syndrome (IRDS). It turned to be 30.22 +/- 10.23 ml/min/1.73 m2 for healthy cases and of 17.49 +/- 9.71 for those with IRDS; significant dirrerence (p less than 0.001). The same situation was true when preterm or healthy full term cases were compared with those with IRDS. No correlation was shown among GFR with the degree of hypoxemia, hypercapnea or acidosis and even if GFR was 13.89 +/- 10.40 ml./min/1.73 m2 in infants with IRDS who died, if compared with 19.32 +/- 9.17 in those who survived, the difference was not significant. At the end, it is concluded that infants with IRDS have decreased GFR, but the constitutents participating in the phenomenon have not been yet identified.</dc:description>
