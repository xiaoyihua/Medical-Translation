<dc:description xml:lang="en">Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, a common clinical practice, needs to be monitored using protombine time expressed as the International Normalized Ratio (INR); when safety range is exceeded, Vitamin K (Vit-K) could be administered with preference orally. In Venezuela the specific oral preparation for Vit-K is not available. This is a double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, clinical trial; 20 patients, age 18-60 year with initial INR ≥ 6, ≤ 10, were randomized to oral Vit-K 1.25mg (prepared from intravenous presentation) or placebo plus withholding warfarin. INR &lt; 3.5 at 24 hours of treatment (the primary end point) was achieved by 70% among Vit-K, and 20% among placebo patients; given an absolute risk reduction (ARR), of 50% (CI95%: 14.4-85.6) p = 0.028, NNT 2 (CI95%: 1.3 - 6.9). No adverse events were recorded including INR &lt; 2 at 24 hours of treatment administration. Our results are consistent with studies where specific oral presentation of Vit-K was used. The results indicate that oral administration of Vit-K, prepared from an intravenous Vit-K preparation, is safe and more effective to revert excessive anticoagulation than simply withholding warfarin, in places where specific preparation of oral Vit-K is not available or too expensive.</dc:description>
