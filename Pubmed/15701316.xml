<dc:description xml:lang="en">Drug-induced esophagitis has frequently been reported in adults, with more than 100 substances involved. However, only a few cases occurring in the pediatric population have been published. The most frequently involved drugs are antibiotics and the incidence of esophagitis is thought to be greater than estimated due to the increase in antibiotic prescription in the last few decades. A medical history suggestive of retrosternal pain, odynophagia with or without dysphagia, and recent drug intake are suspicious for this entity. Although most cases are self-limiting, complications such as hemorrhage or perforation have been described. We present two cases of doxycycline-induced esophagitis in two teenagers that illustrate the clinical course, endoscopic pattern and treatment of this entity.</dc:description>
