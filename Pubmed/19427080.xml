<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION A growing number of immigrants are using the public health services for HIV in Spain. We describe the sociodemographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of a cohort of naïve HIV-infected subjects (CoRIS cohort) according to their place of origin. METHODS CoRIS is an open, hospital-based cohort of naïve, HIV-infected persons attended in 19 hospitals from 9 of the 19 autonomous regions in Spain. We describe the characteristics of the cohort members by place of origin, and compare them with the Spanish cases identified from January 2004 to October 2006, using the chi-square and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS Of 2507 patients, 76.3% were men and median age was 36 years. By origin, 71.5% were Spanish, 16.0% Latin Americans (LA), 5.8% sub-Saharan Africans (SSA), 3.7% Western Europeans (WE), 1.7% Eastern Europeans (EE) and 1.4% North Africans (NA). Compared to Spaniards, there were significant differences by origin in sex, age, and transmission category. Median CD4 count at cohort entry was 352 cell/microL, with no differences according to origin. Median viral load was 48 962 copies/mL and was significantly lower for SSA. Over 11.4 months of follow-up, 57.9% initiated HAART with no differences by origin. Hepatitis C prevalence was 29.9% in Spaniards, 7.3% in Latin Americans, 11.7% in SSA, and 45.7% in EE (P&lt;0.05). Overall, 13.4% were Mantoux-positive (28.6% in SSA and 30.8% in NA). Tuberculosis was more common among cases from EE (9.5%) and SSA (8.3%) compared to Spaniards (4.8%) (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS Almost one third of naïve HIV-infected patients in CoRIS are foreign-born. Their sociodemographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics reflect the epidemic in their places of origin. However, their immunological status at cohort entry and initiation of HAART is no different from that of Spaniards.</dc:description>
