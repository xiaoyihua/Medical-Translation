<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this work is the study of malaria in the population of our hospital area. The characteristics of 31 cases of imported malaria diagnosed in the University Hospital La Fe of Valencia are described. The study included the period between 1993 and 2002. The predominance of males (81%), of the age group of 20-40 years (average: 37.68), and of the patients native from African countries (all except for a patient from Ecuador) of which 40% came from Equatorial Guinea, were outstanding results. The most prevalent species was Plasmodium falciparum (72%). Only 12.9% of the patients received antimalarial prophylaxis with mefloquine, without appropriate compliance. Malaria continues to be the most important protozoan infection in the world, and currently a possible reintroduction of this infection is observed in Spain. That is why is necessary to improve the information offered to the tourists who visit tropical countries. The clinical suspicion is also essential in patients who come from endemic areas.</dc:description>
