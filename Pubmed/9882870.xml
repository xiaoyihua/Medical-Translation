<dc:description xml:lang="en">The QADVP (questionnaire for assessment of disabled by vestibular pathology) is self-employed and consists of a series of 46 questions divided into 3 scales (emotional, functional and organic) from which direct and proportionate scores (both for each scale and as a whole for the full questionnaire) are gained. The aim of the paper is to show its application-way, the outcome of assessments and the disability degree drawn out from the scores. A prospective study fulfilled within 2 years term (May, 1st 1994 until May, 1st 1996) between patients of the Health Area of Zamora, seen at the ENT outpatients Department. The validation's study (reliability, homogeneity and discriminatory power in each scale and of the whole questionnaire) was made from a sample of 30 patients suffering of recurring-paroxysmal vestibular disease of several etiologies. In order to establish the handicap degree the questionnaire was employed in 60 patients suffering postural-paroxysmal vertigo or Ménière disease, grouped in 4 homogenous sets after the evolutive time. The series in each scale and globally for the whole questionnaire make sharp 4 levels of handicap (from I to IV). Zero degree is equivalent to absence of vestibular disorder. The QADVP is a measuring tool allowing: assessment several degrees of incapacity, to control the development of the disorder and try therapeutic changes.</dc:description>
