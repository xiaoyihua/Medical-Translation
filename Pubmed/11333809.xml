<dc:description xml:lang="en">Because health-care costs and demand for services are both rising, appropriate management of resources is yet another essential consideration in efficient clinical practice. Surgical units, with their special features, are a particular focus of attention. Although it is possible to study the circumstances of each hospital individually, in fact surgical units often share the same management concerns. Currently, surgical units are often reorganized and provided with an Operating Room Committee, a Medical director or coordinator and operational protocols, such that the unit is considered a system rather than a sum of its individual parts. Work is goal-oriented, with starting and ending points, flexibility in use of surgical theaters, reserve capacity for unscheduled surgery, low cancellation rates and good output; the use of time indicators is considered essential. Other factors to bear in mind when managing a surgical unit are the universalization of information, which should be accurate and up to date, the involvement of teams such as that of anesthesia and recovery, scheduling that is realistic and tight, the appropriate design and use of circuits, and the use of techniques for continuous improvement and problem solving. Some programs, such as that of major outpatient surgery, orthopedic surgery and others may have special needs.</dc:description>
