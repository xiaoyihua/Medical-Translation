<dc:description xml:lang="en">To examine the principle sociocultural characteristics of the illness experience in a group of senior citizens diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis, a total of 50 subjects over 60 years old were selected to answer an open-ended questionnaire. Using intentional non-probabilistic sampling, 25% of the sample were randomly selected, and semi-structured interviews were conducted. All individuals in the study are covered by social security institutions and receive medical care at a clinic located in southeastern Mexico City. Explanations for antecedents, causes, symptoms, and treatment of the illness relate to the individual social context. Although these seniors provided folk explanations for the causes of their illnesses, they treat themselves with a combination of biomedical and herbal resources. The authors conclude that it is necessary to analyze how the elderly live with chronic illness in order to propose effective measures to improve their quality of life and provision of health care services.</dc:description>
