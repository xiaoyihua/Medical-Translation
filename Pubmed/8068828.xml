<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to relate the symptoms attributed to motor-sensitive diabetic polyneuropathy to the findings in the exploration of osteo-tendinous reflexes and vibrative sensibility. DESIGN We carried out an observation prospective study of a crossover type, where the method of selection was simple random. SETTING The study was performed in the Carranque Health Centre, Málaga. PATIENTS The sample consisted of those patients with type II Diabetes and over 40 when first recorded, who were seen by one of five general medical practices over a one-year period. There were 120 in all. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Average age was 65.7 (SD = 9.5). There were 47 men and 73 women. Paraesthesia was reported in 40 cases (33.3%), muscular spasms in 41 (34.1%) and pain in 31 (25.8%). The findings were: lack of Achilles reflex in 65 cases (54.1%) and vibrative anaesthesia in 55 cases (45.8%). Lack of Achilles reflex showed a statistically significant association with nocturnal muscular spasms (p = 0.04) and vibrative anaesthesia (p = 0.001). Vibrative anaesthesia showed a prevalence which was directly proportional to age (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS We concluded that lack of Achilles reflex and vibrative anaesthesia in diabetic patients are good indicators of the existence of motor-sensitive Polyneuropathy, although vibrative anaesthesia was found to be related to other factors such as age.</dc:description>
