<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The increasing incidence of Candida yeasts infections and its hospital and community repercussion (vaginal thrush), as well as the will to acquire the knowledge of the new antifungal that were launched to the therapeutic store, have motivated us to identify that type of yeasts from different sources, as well as to study their behaviour against the antifungal, using commercial procedures with easy clinical application. MATERIALS AND METHODS An amount of 317 Candida yeasts were identified through commercial procedures (CHROMagar Candida and Auxacolor): 108 vaginals, 138 from ICU newborn children and 71 from ICU adults, while the antifungal drug susceptibilities was done to 199 of the isolated ones using another commercial procedure (Fungitest). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Candida albicans is identified as the most frequent in both hospital and community samples (78.7 and 45.93%, respectively), followed by Candida glabrata (19.44 and 28.23%, respectively). The sensitivity to amphotericin B and to 5-flucytosine was very high in every studied group, while sensitivity to imidazole derivatives depends on the samples source (lower sensitivity in the ICU newborn isolated ones) and the species (C. glabrata is less sensitive than C. albicans).</dc:description>
