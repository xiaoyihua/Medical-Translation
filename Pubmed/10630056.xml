<dc:description xml:lang="en">The outcome of 32 pregnancies in renal allograft recipients is reported. The mean age at the time of conception was 27.3 years (range, 20 to 37) with an average interval of 47 months from the time of transplantation to conception (range, 2 to 163). Twenty-nine patients received the graft from a living related donor, one from a living no related donor an 2 from cadaver donors. All patients continued their immunosuppressive regimen during pregnancy and only 6 patients were taking cyclosporine A. Hypertension during pregnancy was observed in 10 patients (31%), superimposed preeclampsia in 4 (14%), preterm labor in 4 (14%) and premature rupture of membranes in 2 (7%). Twenty-eight pregnancies resulted in 28 liveborn infants and there were 4 miscarriages. Cesarean section was performed in 17 cases and 11 had vaginal delivery. Intrauterine growth retardation was observed in 4 cases (14%), fetal distress in 2 (7%) and one neonatal death due to multiple malformations. There was not significative impairment of renal function in this group.</dc:description>
