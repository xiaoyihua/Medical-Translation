<dc:description xml:lang="en">The new information presented in Digestive Disease Week has allowed us to speculate on the future of inflammatory bowel disease. Manipulation of diet and the microbioma will probably play an increasingly important role in the treatment of this disease and, in the long term, in its prevention. Biological agents will probably be used earlier and more widely; new information on levels of biological agents, mucosal healing and new comparative studies will also allow these agents to be used in a more precise and personalized way. In addition to infliximab, adalimumab, natalizumab and certolizumab, other biological agents will be employed; among the first of these to be used will be ustekinumab, golimumab and vedolizumab. In the near future, biological agents will be used as frequently in ulcerative colitis as in Crohn's disease. New healthcare models will be developed that will progressively include greater participation among patients and nurses. The ability to predict new diagnostic and prognostic models will allow decisions to be more individualized.</dc:description>
