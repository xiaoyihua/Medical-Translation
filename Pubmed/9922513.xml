<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Acute lymphoblastic leukemia has a different evolution in children and adults. Complete remission is achieved in 70-85% of the latter, but only 25 to 35% have a prolonged disease-free survival. AIM To assess the treatment outcome of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Chile. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective review of the medical files of 51 adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated according to the national protocol for antineoplastic drugs, in a public hospital of Santiago. RESULTS Mean age of patients was 35.9 years old and 53% were younger than 20 years old. Complete remission was achieved in 64%. Early mortality occurred in 22%, mostly due to infections. Treatment failure occurred in 16%. Global survival was 17 months and global survival at 5 years was 24%. Prognostic criteria of the protocol, defined a low risk group that had a complete remission of 100%, no early deaths and 5 year disease-free survival of 53%. The group defined as having high risk had a complete remission of 47%, a 29% early mortality and a 5 years disease-free survival of 6%. CONCLUSIONS Aiming to improve treatment results in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, efforts should be made to improve the management of febrile neutropenic patients and to intensify chemotherapy.</dc:description>
