<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE This study was designed to assess changes in skeletal muscle characteristics after 6 weeks' high-intensity physical training of patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to determine how the changes were related to improvements in exercise tolerance and health related quality of life (HRQL). PATIENTS AND METHODS Ten patients with a mean (SD) age of 60 (10) years and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 32% (9%) were enrolled. The effect of training on the 6-minute walk test, HRQL questionnaires, and skeletal muscles was examined for the 8 patients who completed the program. The structural and chemical characteristics of skeletal muscles before and after training were studied in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies. RESULTS Training significantly modified the 6-minute walk test (P&lt;.01), HRQL (P&lt;.05), and citrate synthetase activity (P&lt;.05). Changes in distances walked during the 6-minute walk test were significantly related to changes in the mean area of fibers (r=0.81). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicate that 6 weeks of high-intensity physical training of COPD patients produces moderate changes in skeletal muscles which could partly explain improvements observed in exercise tolerance after respiratory rehabilitation.</dc:description>
