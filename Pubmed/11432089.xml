<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED This study was performed to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous dodecafluoropentane emulsion (Echo Gen), to determine the efficacy and duration of contrast agent in left cavities by transthoracic echocardiography and to evaluate the clinical impact of Echogen. Fifteen patients were studied, by transthoracic echocardiography. Duration of contrast intensity of left ventricular cavity opacification and endocardial border definition were studied. The adverse effects were assessed immediately, 24 hours and 7 days after Echogen. Both the vital signs and electrocardiogram did not show any significant changes. Minimal changes in hepatic function in one patient and in renal function in other one were observed. The mean duration of left ventricular opacification was 4 minutes 47 seconds and full or intermediate opacification was more frequently observed after Echogen. Endocardial border delineation was poor in one patient, intermediate in five and excellent in nine. In 86.7% the diagnostic information obtained was sufficiently and allowed other studies. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that Echogen is effective for Left ventricular cavity opacification, endocardial border definition and assessment of left ventricular volume and ejection fraction 2) The obtained information with the use of Echogen allowed other studies. 3) The intravenous administration of Echogen is safe in doses of 0.05 ml/Kg.</dc:description>
