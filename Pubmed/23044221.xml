<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To explore the method of building a stable urethral stricture (US) model in New Zealand white rabbits. METHODS Through 10X magnification optical microscope, a resection of 1.0cm urethral mucosa was made in 6 male rabbits and other 6 male rabbits were controlled. After 60 days, the rabbits were evaluated with urethrography, urethral pressure profile (UPP) and histology. RESULT Urethrography demonstrated a stricture with narrow lumen and discontinuous mucosa in the resection group. The urethras of the control animals were all normal. UPP showed that the urethral pressure on operative site in the controlled group was 14.67±2.16cmHO, and 27.83±3.71 cmHO in the resection group. There was significant statistical difference between the two groups (P&lt;.01). The urothelium was well-distributed, covered without any inflammatory cells in the controlled group, which had 3-4 layers of the epithelial cells. And the urothelium was unequally covered with neutrophils and lymphocytes in the resection group. CONCLUSIONS We establish the way to build a stable urethral stricture model of New Zealand rabbits by the microsurgical technique, which is a good laboratory model to research all kinds of urethral stricture. Urethrography and histology combined UPP are the reliable methods to identify the urethral stricture.</dc:description>
