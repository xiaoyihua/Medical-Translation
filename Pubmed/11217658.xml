<dc:description xml:lang="en">A general overview of hypertension as a major health problem in Cuba in the last 25 years are presented. In the first period, 1974-1990 was created a National Hypertension High Commission by the Minister of Public and the First national program for prevention and Control of Hypertension in Cuba was launched. To define high blood pressure in adults 15 years and older the cut-off point was set at 160/95 mmHg. The prevalence found was 15% in urban areas and 7-8% in rural areas. The second period, 1991-1998 the original National program was re-evaluated in 1990 and 1995. The new blood pressure cut-off point was set at 140/90 mmHg. The prevalence increased to 30.6% in urban areas and 15% in rural areas and incidence of 2.5% annual. A total of 862,303 hypertensive patients were registry at the end of 1997 which represents less than 40% of the total number of possible hypertensive patients. A National Campaign was launched in 1998. In 9 months the preliminary reports were: 25% increase in prevalence, registry and follow-up of hypertensive patients 15 years old and older (8.5% to 12.5%); 92.9% of primary care doctors and 89.5% of primary care nurses received training; improvement in public education and social support; improvement in risk factor awareness in general public and improvement of hypotensive drugs availability and splygmomanometers supplies.</dc:description>
