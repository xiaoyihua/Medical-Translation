<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Controversy remains about the management of gallstone ileus. While some authors propose enterotomy, others defend the one-stage procedure (simultaneously fistula repair). The objective of the present study was to analyze management options and comparative study their results. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective and descriptive study with revision of clinical stories of patients with the diagnosis of gallstone ileus between 1987 and 2008. All the following variables were recorded: dates of hospital admission, surgery and discharge, age, sex, pathological antecedents, preoperative or intraoperative diagnosis, treatment, location of the fistula and location of the obstruction. End-result variables were: postoperative complications, mortality, complications during the follow-up and biliary complications. RESULTS A total of 40 patients were included of 46,648 admissions. Age, comorbidity, and intraoperative diagnosis were related with poorer short- and long-outcomes. The percentage of postoperative complications was similar for groups with and without fistula repair. Mortality was higher in the group with fistula repair (15 vs. 25%). Biliary complications were more frequent in the group without fistula repair (11 vs. 0%). Sex, location of the fistula and location of the obstruction did not be related with the prognosis. CONCLUSION One-stage procedure is related with higher mortality rate than enterotomy alone. Nevertheless, fistula repair reduces the number of biliary complications during the follow-up.</dc:description>
