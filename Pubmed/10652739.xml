<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION We present a series of Behavioural phenotypes treated with neurocognitive and neuroemotional procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS A sample of 26 cases were selected according to qualitative methodology from neuropediatric patients. The method was based on using the PASS theory of intelligence to approach the cognitive problem and the theory of masquerade behaviour as self-defence to solve the emotional problem. Both theories have neurological bases. DN:CAS battery was utilized for assessment of cognitive processes. On the other hand, analysis of cases was carried out doing data analysis with video recorder device. RESULTS All cases were considered responder cases although in different degree. The responder was defined as the patient which reached better intellectual achievement with respect to cognitive function and which gave up, at least partially, masquerade Behaviour with respect to emotional function. DISCUSSION The Behaviour of the Behavioural phenotypes has neurological rationale. The PASS theory and the planning, in particular, supported by prefrontal cortex justifies consistently some behaviours. The masquerade Behaviour theory is explained by the fear emotional response mechanism which means emotion is a cerebral processing with neurological rationale. CONCLUSIONS The Behavioural phenotypes are Behaviours and every Behaviour can be explained by neurological reasons both cognitive and emotional reasons. So, they can be treated by a cognitive and emotional procedure understood in the light of the neurology.</dc:description>
