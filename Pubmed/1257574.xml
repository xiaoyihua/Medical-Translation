<dc:description xml:lang="en">Pyruvate related compounds have been tested for their active or inhibitory properties on LDH. Special structure features were needed for compounds to be bound to the enzyme active site. Pyruvate and the LDH molecule were bound by the interaction of the carboxyl group or its ester derivative, with the enzyme. Ethyl pyruvate seemed to behave as a substrate of the enzyme whereas acetophenone, ethyl acetoacetate and beta-oxoglutarate did not act as substrates or inhibitors of LDH. Phenyl pyruvate, alpha-oxoglutarate and L-mandelate are not substrates but inhibitors of the LDH. It seems that a structure having a carbonyl group in the alpha-position to the carboxyl is required for the binding of a compound to the LDH molecule. Glyoxylate alpha-oxobutyrate and alpha-oxovalerianate appear to be worse LDH substrates than pyruvate itself. This seems to suggest that the shortening or the extension of the pyruvate aliphatic chain induces a decrease of the affinity of the enzyme towards their substrate homologues.</dc:description>
