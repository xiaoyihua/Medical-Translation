<dc:description xml:lang="en">We evaluate our experience in solid ovarian tumors at the Children's Hospital La Fe. The main aims of the study were finding out relevant clinical data for a correct clinical approach, and the optimal surgical attitude in order to obtain tumor relieving with preservation of fertility when possible. A review of 28 girls under 14 years with solid ovarian tumors was carried out. Previous history, initial symptoms and signs, analytical and radiological explorations, treatment and evolution were analysed. 17 benign and 11 malignant tumors were found. Main clinical data were acute abdominal pain and palpation of a mass. Surgery was performed in all of them: salpyngo-oophorectomy in 23 and oophorectomy in 5, with tumoral resection. All patients survive, with periodic follow-up. We remark the frequency of acute abdominal pain as initial symptom of an ovarian tumor, and the importance of a surgical attitude that, intending to be curative, would preserve fertility.</dc:description>
