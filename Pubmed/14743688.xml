<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND There are few studies looking for collagen matrix defects in patients with inguinal bernia. AIM To study the skin connective tissue in patients with and without inguinal bernia. PATIENTS AND METHODS Skin from the surgical wound was obtained from 23 patients with and 23 patients without inguinal bernia. The samples were processed for conventional light microscopy. Collagen fibers were stained with Van Giesson and elastic fibers with Weigert stain. RESULTS Patients without hernia had compact collagen tracts homogeneously distributed towards the deep dermis. In contrast, patients with hernia had zones in the dermis with thinner and disaggregated collagen tracts. Connective tissue had a lax aspect in these patients. Collagen fiber density was 52% lower in patients with hernia, compared to subjects without hernia. No differences in elastic fiber density or distribution was observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS Patients with inguinal bernia have alterations in skin collagen fiber quality and density.</dc:description>
