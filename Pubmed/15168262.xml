<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Restless legs syndrome is an underdiagnosed disorder of unknown etiology, that generates severe sleep and life quality disturbances. In its therapeutic approach, drugs with very different action mechanisms and variable results have been used. METHODS Nineteen outpatients diagnosed of restless legs syndrome were studied observationally. A semistructured interview was carried out and physical variables (weight, arterial pressure and heart rate), sensitive and motor symptoms, effective dose of topiramate, side effects and fulfillment of the treatment at 30, 60 and 90 days were studied. RESULTS The patients studied, with an average age of 62.052 +/- 6.22 years, showed improvement in sensitive and motor symptoms, as well as non-significant reductions in cardiovascular parameters. The mean effective dose of topiramate was established at 42.1 +/- 18.7 mg. A significant reduction in weight stands out among the side effects. CONCLUSIONS Topiramate is profiled as an effective treatment in restless legs syndrome, with good tolerability and minimal side effects.</dc:description>
