<dc:description xml:lang="en">Recent years have seen an increase in drunkenness among young people who go out at weekends, but there is limited information on the relationship between sexuality and drunkenness in these contexts. Here we analyze, in a sample of 440 people aged 14 to 25 who frequent nightlife recreational contexts, who have had sexual relationships and who use some type of drug or alcohol, the reasons for not initiating a sexual liason, as a function of drunkenness and gender. The sampling method used was respondent-driven sampling. The results show that 63.3% admit that under the effects of alcohol or other drugs they have failed to take precautions in their sexual relations, the proportion of women not taking precautions being higher than that of men. The results referring to the reasons for not initiating a sexual liason are similar across genders and states of drunkenness. The only difference found is that women are more likely to reject sex when the prospective partner is inappropriate. A logistic regression analysis indicates that drunkenness is the most important variable in explaining the different sexual behaviors. We conclude that drunkenness is related to the failure to take precautions in sexual relations, the results being similar in men and women.</dc:description>
