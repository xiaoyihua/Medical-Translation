<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of omeprazole treatment on the symptoms and lesions of patients with posterior laryngitis (PL). PATIENTS AND METHOD Twenty-one patients with a clinical and laryngoscopic diagnosis of PL were studied. Results for each laryngeal symptom (dysphonia, hoarseness, cough, foreign body sensation, and burning) and laryngoscopic finding (mucus stasis, erythema, oedema, hypertrophy, ulceration, and granulation) at baseline, 12 weeks after treatment with omeprazole, 20 mg twice daily, and 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation were compared. No changes in their hygienic-dietary or postural habits were recommended. RESULTS A reduction in symptom severity and frequency was observed (p &lt; 0.05), as well as in the severity of laryngoscopic findings (p &lt; 0.05)--except for granulation--immediately after treatment discontinuation. A relapse of laryngoscopic findings was seen at 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation (p &lt; 0.01). The trend towards symptom recurrence was not significant. CONCLUSION Treatment with omeprazole alone modifies clinical manifestations and endoscopic findings in patients with PL. Controlled clinical trials with a high number of patients and longer-term follow-up are needed to define the best therapeutic regimen for these patients.</dc:description>
