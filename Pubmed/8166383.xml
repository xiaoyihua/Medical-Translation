<dc:description xml:lang="en">The results of 104 endoscopically controlled dacryocystorhinostomies performed in 93 patients from June 1989 to June 1993 are presented. Postoperatively, 38 patients had a hematoma, 12 a subcutaneous emphysema and three patients an intraorbital emphysema. All complications were transitory. On 89 sides (85.57%) dacryorrhea was completely cured, on ten sides (9.61%) it was eased considerably, and it was not resolved in five cases, of whom, two had been operated through an external approach previously. A closed postoperative care is important in order to achieve good results. In 25.6% of the cases, the anterior ethmoid displayed patterns of a chronic inflammation. Its involvement in the pathogenesis of chronic dacrocystitis has to be discussed. In many cases, the localisation of the lacrimal gland is more posteriorly than described in anatomy leading to an impeded drainage and subsequently to dacryoadenitis. In our hands, the endoscopically controlled dacryocystorhinostomy presents as a save approach and a good alternative to the procedure described by Toti.</dc:description>
