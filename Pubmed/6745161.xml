<dc:description xml:lang="en">For the purpose of measuring the extent to which the modern university accomplishes its purposes, the authors have devised an evaluation methodology inspired by the work of the most modern international specialists in the subject. They have applied their methodology first to the system for evaluating medical programs in general and then to a specific medical program regarded as representative of medical training in Chile. Surveys of faculty and students led them to the conclusion that in actual evaluative practice there have been wide deviations from the ideal model, and that the evaluation system could be improved to become an essential component of the process of informing and training the student and to provide feedback to th teaching-learning process.</dc:description>
