<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To study the changes in the health related quality of life (HRQOL) during the first year following renal transplant (RT), comparing azathioprine vs mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in triple immunosuppressant therapy with prednisone and cyclosporine. METHODS Prospective, open and random study with 26 patients who received a primary cadaveric renal transplant consecutively. Analysis of clinical variables: delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR), infections and comorbidity; analytical: haemogram, albumin and serum creatinine, hepatic function, cyclosporin levels; instruments for assessing the HRQOL: Psychological General Well-being Index (PGWBI) and Euroqol-5d (EQ-5d) health questionnaire, which includes a self-assessment scale of the state of health, Visual Analogical Scale (VAS). Controlled collection of data upon discharge following renal transplant, and subsequently 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following the first questionnaire. RESULTS There were no differences between patients on azathioprine or MMF, except that AR occurred less frequently with MMF (7% vs 42%, p = 0.065). Global AR: 23%, cytomegalovirus infection/illness: 81%/8%, readmissions: 42%. There was an improvement in HRQOL measured by the progressive increase in the scores on the PGWBI, EQ-5d and VAS during the first three months following RT. By the sixth month, in comparison to the third, a decrease in the score was observed (PGWBI, p = 0.011). Later the HRQOL improved, but without reaching the maximum scores achieved. CONCLUSIONS Patients on MMF showed less frequent incidence of AR. The HRQOL decreases during the third and the sixth month, but with less intensity in patients on MMF, probably related to the lower rate of AR, and excluding the over 60s.</dc:description>
