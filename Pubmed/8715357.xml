<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this study is to value the effectiveness of a care plan of mouth care and at the same time, compare the effects of the use of two different solutions: physiologic serum and non-diluted hexetidine (Oraldine). The sample studied was formed by 40 intubated patients or patients with an absolute oral diet who were in the Intensive Care Unit of the University Clinic. 50% of the patients underwent oral hygiene with physiological serum, following the established protocol and the other 50% were treated with non-diluted hexetidine with a frequency of five times a day. The mouth status was checked at the moment of admission and then daily: lips, tongue, gums, palate, presence of residua and saliva characteristics. Also, a series of factors which could alter the buccal integrity were registered: oxygenotherapy, orotraqueal intubation, anemia, plaquetopenia, medicines, etc. Bacteriological controls of traqueal secretion were performed periodically. From the analysis of the results we can conclude that the care plan established is efficient, although it is not enough for patients with coagulation alterations (plaquetopenia). From the solutions used for oral hygiene we can say that although there have not been significant differences, the physiologic serum is the chosen product, as it maintains the mouth status better and helps to keep the oral microbiota.</dc:description>
