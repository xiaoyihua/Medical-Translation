<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of the work is to establish the criteria, indicators and standards of accreditation of the tenured university professors according to the opinion of Associate Professors and Professors. It is a cross-sectional study of the populations by means of surveys with probabilistic samples. The sample consisted of 1,294 university professors of whom 72% were Associate Professors and 28% Professors. The sample was selected by proportional cluster random sampling (the Full Professors' types and the fields of knowledge). A survey was used to establish criteria, indicators, and standards for each type of professor. The results show different standards according to the criteria in different fields of knowledge. Qualitative differences (according to the criteria) and quantitative differences (according to the standards) to accredit Associate Professors and Professors were found.</dc:description>
