<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective was to determine clinical characteristics and evolution of the neonate in critical status, son of mother with preeclampsia/eclampsia, in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). And looking for differences between the son of mother with preeclampsia and the mother with eclampsia. Revision of 425 charts of discharged neonates of a NICU. Infants of mother with preeclampsia/eclampsia were included. Was done the variables by means of descriptive statistics are analyzed, and t Student and chi square for the comparative study. 88 neonates were included, 46 of preeclampsia and 42 of eclampsia. Their characteristics were (X +/- SD): Maternal age 25 +/- 4 years, birth weight 1587 +/- 601 grams, gestational age 32 +/- 3 weeks. Apgar to the one minute 5 +/- 1. Apgar to the five minutes 6 +/- 1. All required mechanical ventilation during 8 +/- 9 days, NICU stay 12 +/- 10 days. Predominated masculine sex 63.2%, and with mortality 21.8% average. In the comparative study, preeclampsia vs eclampsia, of the same variables we found significant difference in; birth weight 1858 +/- 654 vs 1340 +/- 422 grams; gestational age 33 +/- 3 vs 31 +/- 2 weeks, and in nosocomial pneumonia 7 vs 33. Most of these neonates were preterm, with Apgar low, prevailed masculine sex, all required mechanic ventilation with stay of 12 days average in the NICU, mortality was low. And the son of mother with eclampsia presented more pneumonia nosocomial.</dc:description>
