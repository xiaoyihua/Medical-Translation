<dc:description xml:lang="en">The author makes a critical evaluation of the excessive preocupation in devising an information system for whatever subject may be under consideration. This has led in some countries to "information without information," since there is a close relationship between socioeconomic development and the capacity to generate information. In the specific field of information on human resources he points out two necessary previous phases which are sometimes ignored: knowing what exists in administrative registries, and knowing what exists and what can be done with national statistics registries such as census and home surveys. Lastly, the author emphasizes the strategic value of combining efforts with national statistics bureaus in this endeavour. The information system will thus be able to provide a short-term and long-term vision, and not only a static view of the situation at any given time.</dc:description>
