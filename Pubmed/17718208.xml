<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To present to new cases of nephroblastoma or Wilms tumor diagnosed in adult age. METHODS The first case we report is a 16-year-old female with the diagnosis of stage I nephroblastoma after radical nephrectomy for a right renal mass. She underwent systemic polychemotherapy. The second case is a 33-year-old female with the diagnosis of nephroblastoma after percutaneous biopsy of a right renal mass. Due to the presence of lymph node, hepatic and lung dissemination systemic polychemotherapy (ACTD-VCR-DOX) was given. Right nephrectomy with regional lymph node dissection and hepatic metastasis excision were performed after confirmation of mass reduction. After that, the patient continued receiving systemic polychemotherapy with the same drugs. After resection of a lung nodule which did not disappear, and after confirmation of tumoral presence CB and VP 16 were added. RESULTS Both patients are disease-free after 58 and 46 months respectively. CONCLUSIONS This type of tumor typical of childhood is extremely rare in adult age, and despite worse survivals and more aggressiveness are described, they may be treated with the same protocols used in children, following any of the two big co-operative groups: American NWTS or European SIOP.</dc:description>
