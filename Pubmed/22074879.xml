<dc:description xml:lang="en">Some arbovirosis have increased their incidence and geographic range in the past few years. This phenomenon has been particularly noticeable in the case of West Nile fever/encephalitis. This disease did not receive much attention until serious outbreaks occurred in Romania, Russia and Israel between 1996 and 1999. But the event drawing an unprecedented attention to this disease was its occurrence in New York in 1999. Since then its incidence and geographic range has not ceased to grow. In America it has extended from coast to coast and from Canada to Argentina. In Europe, the disease incidence has increased in areas where it had already been reported, and, recently, affected other areas where it had never been observed before. The present article is a review on the virus, the disease, and its situation in Europe, with special reference to Spain, where in 2010 human and veterinary cases were reported.</dc:description>
