<dc:description xml:lang="en">Small bowel tumors (SBT) are rare neoplasms and represent less than 10% of all gastrointestinal tumors. The majority of them are benign and discovered at the time of autopsy. However of those who present symptoms the majority belong to the group of malignant tumors and require of treatment. The most common histological variety are the adenocarcinoma and the carcinoid tumors. Abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction or gastrointestinal bleeding are the most common clinical complaints. Endoscopy or contrast X-ray examination are the most common forms of diagnosis and surgery remain the best way of treatment chemotherapy or radiotherapy are used in combination with surgery according to the histological diagnosis, the survival depends to the final histological report. A review of the experience at the National Institute of Cancer in Mexico city was performed and 34 patients were found with the diagnosis of SBT of which the majority presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and abdominal distension. The most common histological diagnosis were the adenocarcinoma (52%) and the leiomyosarcoma (32%). Surgery was the most common form of treatment (73%) of which in 20% distant metastasis was diagnosed. Only nine are alive at the time of the report without recurrent disease with a mean follow up of 7 months. Our experience shows that SBT are rare neoplasms, the majority are diagnosed late but surgery remain the best way of treatment because it can offer the possibility of cure or adequate palliation with derivative procedures.</dc:description>
