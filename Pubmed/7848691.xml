<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this study we assessed the quality of life of a group of cirrhotic patients who underwent liver transplant using a psychological test to evaluate family relations, work activity, emotional state and social relations. The quantification of hospital dependence and degree of fitness for work, before and after the transplant were also analyzed. 32 patients were included in the study with the diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis and minimum post-transplant follow-up of 6 months. The average age of the study population was 44.8 +/- 10.5 years; there were 23 males and 9 females, with an average follow-up of 15 months. The psychological test used was the Quality of Life Scale (QLS), which consists of 21 items, each scoring from 1 to 6 points. The questionnaire was completed before the transplant by all the patients, and after the transplant by 32 patients at 6 months, 20 at 12 months and 12 at 24 months. Hospital dependence was evaluated by number of admissions and number of days per admission. Lastly, we compare the rate of unfitness for work before the transplant and at one and two years after the transplant. The QLS test showed a post-transplant improvement in the 4 aspects assessed, specially in the personal aspects (emotions and family) (p &lt; 0.001). Hospital dependence following pre-transplant situation (p &lt; 0.01). Finally, the post-transplant percentage of unfitness for work decreased with time, reaching significant differences 2 years after the liver transplant (p &lt; 0.05).</dc:description>
