<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To find the incidence of brucellosis, and analyse its epidemiological characteristics and the evolution of the cases recorded in the Sierra de Cádiz Primary Care (PC) Area during 1992. DESIGN A prospective longitudinal incidence analysis, with a nested study of cases and controls. SETTING Sierra de Cádiz PC Area. CASES members of the cohort who developed the disease. CONTROLS sample of members of the cohort free of Brucellosis paired for age, gender and town of origin. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Incidence was 52.39 per 100,000, 66.27 and 38.20 per 100,000 in men and women, respectively. Highest incidence was at between 15 and 49 years of age (67.70 per 100,000). CASES in the Spring predominated (chi 2 = 16.77, gl = 3, p &lt; 0.05). The most affected professional group was farmers/herders (RR = 4.59, CI 95%, 2.05-10.26). CONCLUSIONS The Sierra de Cádiz is an area with endemic brucellosis, especially in the districts of Olvera and Ubrique. Its work-related character is clear, in spite of the digestive tract being the main transmission path.</dc:description>
