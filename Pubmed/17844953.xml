<dc:description xml:lang="en">We detail here the clinical case of a 22 month old child who was referred to our department because of recurring episodes of upper dyspnea and barking cough since he was 3 months old. The Pediatric Department suspected laryngeal stenosis or laryngomalacia and asked for confirmation of this. The ENT examination including nasofibrolaryngoscopy was normal. A computerised axial tomography (CAT) was carried out, as well as a magnetic resonance of the neck, both eliminating possible pathologies. Having tried several treatments, we prescribed empirical treatment with proton pump inhibitors, and to our surprise the improvement was spectacular. We have carried out a review of literature about gastroesophageal reflux, its manifestations, diagnosis and treatment.</dc:description>
