<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cells respond to environmental or cellular changes, rapidly switching protein activities from one state to another. In eukaryotes, a way to achieve these changes is through protein phosphorylation cycles, involving independent protein kinase and protein phosphatase activities. Current evidences show that phosphatases and kinases are also involved in the molecular basis of immune response and in disease such as diabetes obesity and Alzheimer. In protozoan parasites like Trypanosoma and Leishmania, several kinases and phosphatases have been identified, many of them have been cloned but in several cases their biological role remains undetermined. In this review, the state-of-the art is summarized and the role of phosphatases and kinases in biological phenomena such as remodeling, invasion and pathogenic capacity of protozoan parasites is described. The real chance to use these components of signal transduction pathways as target for chemotherapeutic intervention is also discussed (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128: 1150-60).</dc:description>
