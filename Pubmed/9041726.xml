<dc:description xml:lang="en">Supraventricular tachycardias (SVT) are the most frequent cause of tachycardia in children. Its pharmacological treatment has adverse effects, is not curative, and is not always effective. During the last few years radiofrequency ablation (RF-A) has changed the treatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate our experience in RF-A in children with SVT. Between 1990 and 1995, 92 patients (1 month to 17 years old) underwent electrophysiological study after the diagnosis of SVT. RF-A was attempted in 55 patients with accessory pathways (AP), slow-pathway of the atrioventricular node, or ectopic focus. The site of ablation was decided according to the electrical signals and the catheter position. The success of the RF-A was confirmed by the interruption of the tachycardia, the change in the sequence of activation of the intracardiac signals, the regression of the preexcitation, and the inability to reinduce tachycardia. RF-A was successful in 81% of the patients; 88% in those with a left AP, 56% in those with a right AP, and 100% in those with nodal reentry. Complications were seen in 7% of the patients: 3 with arterial obstruction, one with a minimal pneumothorax, and one with cardiac tamponade. During a follow up of 16.6 months there was no relapse nor late complications. We conclude that RF-A is a safe and effective procedure in pediatric patients with SVT.</dc:description>
