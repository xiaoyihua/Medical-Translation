<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Appropriate antimicrobial therapy shortens the duration of Shigellosis and significantly reduces the risk of transmission. Shigella strains resistant to common antimicrobials have increased during the past years, determining the need for a periodic surveillance, to guide effective therapy. AIM To report the results of a surveillance program in a rural community near Santiago (Colina), for Shigella infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 1995 and 1997, stool samples from 3,534 episodes of diarrhoea, that occurred in Colina, were obtained. Two hundred twenty six Shigella strains were isolated and studied for susceptibility to ampicilin (AM), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC), cotrimoxazole (STX), chloramphenicol (CAF), tetracycline (TET), furazolidine (FU), ciprofloxacine (CIPR), nalidixic acid (AC NAL), gentamycin (GENT) and cefotaxime (CFTX). RESULTS Shigella flexnerii represented 134 of 226 Shigella strains isolated. All strains were susceptible to CIPR, AC NAL, GENT and CFTX. Yearly variation of resistance patterns to other antimicrobials were observed for these strains. Resistance to AM varied from 56 to 76%, to AMC from 25 to 56%, to STX from 21 to 47%, to CAF from 36 to 69%, to TET from 44 to 78% and to FU from 9 to 18%. Overall resistance was higher during 1997. All 85 strains of S sonnei were susceptible to CIPR, AC NAL and CFTX. Resistance throughout the years varied from 56 to 88% for AM, from 0 to 28% for AMC, from 44 to 53% for STX, from 11 to 40% for CAF, from 11 to 42% for TET and from 5 to 11% for FU. Overall resistance was also higher during 1997, except for AM and STX. Seven S hoydii strains were isolated, only during 1995. All seven were resistant to AM and TET and none were resistant to FU, CIPR, AC NAL and CFTX. Two strain was resistant to AMC, STX and CAF. CONCLUSIONS Antimicrobial resistance patterns of Shigella sp isolated in Colina have increased from 1995 to 1997, specially for commonly used antimicrobials. Resistance remains low for furazolidine and all strains remain susceptible to quinolones.</dc:description>
