<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study aimed to determine the use and perceptions towards information and communication technologies (ICT) in 206 patients with arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes, recruited from the outpatient clinic in a national hospital in Lima, Peru. 54.4% were older adults and 70.4% were women. The use of daily phone calls was 44.7%. Most had never used a computer (78.2%), email (84%) or the Internet (84%). Many have never sent (80.6%) or received (69.9%) a text message. 70% had at some time forgotten to take their medicine. 72.8% would like to be reminded to take their medication and 67.9% had a family member who could help them with access to ICT. Despite the low use of ICT in this population, there is willingness and expectation from the patients to participate in programs that implement them.</dc:description>
