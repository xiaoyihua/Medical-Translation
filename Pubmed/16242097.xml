<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS To evaluate the effects of a worksite smoking cessation program conducted to reduce the prevalence of smokers among staff of the town council of Sabadell (Spain). POPULATION AND METHODS A pre-post intervention study was conducted. A survey was performed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of smokers and to invite them to participate in a smoking cessation program. The intervention involved an individual visit with medical history, measurement of carbon monoxide in expired air and prescription of nicotine replacement therapy followed by 12 sessions of group therapy over 1 year to reinforce abstinence. Follow-up to evaluate abstinence took place at 6, 12 and 24 months. A post-intervention survey was carried out to evaluate the program's effectiveness. RESULTS A total of 1,203 questionnaires were sent with a response rate of 51%. Thirty-three percent of the subjects (n = 204) were smokers and 101 smokers enrolled in the program. Abstinence rates at 12 and 24 months were 45% and 33% respectively with no differences between sexes. Low and moderate nicotine dependence was associated with a greater probability of abstinence at 6 (OR = 6.7; p = 0.01) and 12 months (OR = 5.4: p = 0.05), adjusted by sex, age, and compliance with nicotine replacement therapy. The prevalence of smokers in the post-intervention questionnaire was 19%. In addition, 26% (n = 10) of subjects who quit smoking in the 12-month study period without participating in the program reported quitting because of the program. CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that worksite smoking cessation programs can substantially contribute to reducing the prevalence of smoking.</dc:description>
