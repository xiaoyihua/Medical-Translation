<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Meningitis due to Salmonella is an unusual sign of salmonellosis. Usually Salmonella causes clinical disorders of the digestive tract, but on occasions, especially in babies, may cause focalized infections such as meningitis. Although meningitis due to Salmonella is unusual, it should be remembered because of its gravity, since it has a high morbimortality. It mainly affects neonatal babies and those under 4 months of age. It usually precedes or is accompanied by gastroenteritis and has a rapid clinical course. CLINICAL CASE We present the case of a neonatal baby girl, 17 days old, who was very irritable, had liquid or semi-liquid faeces and high fever of unknown origin with poor response to antipyretic drugs. On lumbar puncture a cloudy liquid, compatible with bacterial meningitis was obtained. Treatment was therefore started immediately with intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxima. CSF culture grew Salmonella which was resistant to ampicillin but sensitive to cefotaxima. Antibiotic treatment was given for 21 days. There was excellent clinical recovery. After eight months of follow-up no sequelae have been seen and her development, both psychomotor, in height and in weight is normal for her age. CONCLUSION Meningitis due to Salmonella is an unusual condition. Immediate, suitable treatment is essential to obtain satisfactory recovery.</dc:description>
