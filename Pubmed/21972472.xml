<dc:description xml:lang="en">The institution "Junta do Exame do Estado Actual e Melhoramento Temporal das Ordens Regulares" (Examination Council for the Actual State and Temporal Improvement of the Religious Orders) was created in November of 1789. Among other things, each Religious House should inform that institution about its heritage either the movables and the landed estates. The inventorying included all the goods belonging to wards and drugstores. In this paper, we aim to study those places using records obtained from a variety of Religious Houses with no regional or Religious Order preferences. We will try to give answers to questions related to that spaces such as 'Which objects could be found inside the Houses?'; 'Were they properly equipped?'; and 'Were there big differences between them in what concerns Religious Orders and Houses locations?'.</dc:description>
