<dc:description xml:lang="en">Simple instruments to detect psychiatric pathology in the elderly patients are sorely needed. We assessed 222 old patients living in nursing homes by means of the Spanish version of the Pfeiffer's Functional Assessment Inventory. The results of the mental health section of the inventory, which includes the Short Psychiatric Evaluation Schedule and four questions about self-perception of mental health, are presented. There were no statistical differences between those who need help in most of the activities of daily living and those who need not. The only exception was that the feeling of loneliness was more frequent among the most able (p = 0.023). Almost half of the 173 patients who completed the evaluation scored in the range of definite psychopathology. Nearly another 10% scored in the range of severe psychopathology or hypochondriasis. This assessment instrument allows and easier study of the prevalence of psychopathology in nursing home residents. It also makes feasible the detection of latent needs for psychiatric care in the elderly living in nursing homes.</dc:description>
