<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The association of colon aganglionosis and anorectal malformation is very rare. The objective is to show five clinical cases of anorectal malformation associated with Hirschprung's disease and its treatment and evolution. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective, transverse, descriptive study was carried out at the National Medical Center "20 de Noviembre ISSSTE" from 1984 to 1999 that included all files of patients with anorectal malformation associated with Hirschprung's disease corroborated by histopathological studies. RESULTS From 151 patients with anorectal malformation studied during a period of 15 years, there were five cases (3.2%) of patients found with anorectal malformation associated with Hirschprung's disease. Of these, two were female. Three patients presented with lower anorectal malformation and two with high anorectal malformation. CONCLUSIONS The association of colon aganglionosis and anorectal malformation should be suspected when the patient evolution during the postoperative period presents abdominal distension, constipation, urinary infection and in younger children with necrotizing enterocolitis.</dc:description>
