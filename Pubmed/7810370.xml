<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report the results of a survey carried out by us in the penitentiary from 1989 to 1992. The aim of it was to determine a possible relationship between criminal behaviour and previous psychiatric pathology. A total of 121 individuals imprisoned from February to april 1989 were studied. Only those convicts who had been free taken into account. Individuals who had been imprisoned before in other prisons were not included in our study. A questionnaire was elaborated by us to carry out this survey. The convicts were tested as soon ad they came into the Oviedo penitentiary. The convicts were classified within two groups. In the first group only those who had previous psychiatric pathology were included. The rest of them, including drug addicts were part of the second group of our study. Our results show that criminal behaviour is much common between those who do not have suffered previously from psychiatric pathology. Furthermore, relationship between psychiatric pathology of the convict and his mother's criminal behaviour was proven. It aslo was shown between psychiatric pathology and suicide or own-inflected injuries.</dc:description>
