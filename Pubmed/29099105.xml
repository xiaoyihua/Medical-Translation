<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective To describe the association among socio-demographic, environmental, psychosocial and health determinants in Mexican elders with chronic and incident depression from a 3-year follow-up study. Methods Data from a cohort study of 1512 Mexicans, 65 and more years old was analyzed. We used a multinomial regression model in order to analyze the associations between determinants of interest with chronic and incident depression conditions, taking as reference a group without depression. In addition, the risk profiles were identified and stratified by sex; and finally, the determinant´s were estimated individually and combined. Results 43.1% of the whole sample did not present depression during the follow-up, 41.9% had chronic depression and 15% incident depression. Chronic depression had more associations with determinants, than incident depression; the latter was associated with poverty and loneliness. The risk profiles for the three depression´s conditions stratified by sex, showed notorious differences. Conclusion Chronic and incident depressions in the elderly are distinct phenomena, the evaluation of the determinant´s contribution to these entities, will allow to identify associated conditions to chronic and incident depression, and the sex differential effect, which will contribute to identify populations and risk factors, to implement objective interventions.</dc:description>
