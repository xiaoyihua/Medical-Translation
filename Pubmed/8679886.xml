<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To describe the frequency and distribution of the consumption of medicines in a census-based sample of people of 60 or over. To determine the association between the consumption of medicines and other socio-demographic and clinical (presence of disease) variables. DESIGN An epidemiological crossover study based in the community. SETTING Rural population: the Health District of Arévalo in Castilla y León. PARTICIPANTS 825 subjects (446 women and 379 men) over 60, with an average age of 71,84. MEASUREMENTS A standard questionnaire was used, containing medicine consumption, prescription, and clinical and demographic features. RESULTS The consumption of medicines per person per day was 1,92. Therapeutic groups most consumed were, in this order, hypotension drugs, cardiotonics, antirheumatics, peripheral vasodilators, digestive system drugs, neurotropics and analgesics. The number of illnesses suffered by this age-group was 2,19. There is a strong connection between consumption of medicines and age, especially in the over 80's. CONCLUSIONS 75% of the target population took some medicine each day. Consumption is higher among women than men. Cardiovascular drugs are the most frequently used therapeutic group. Consumption of medicines is directly related to age and the number of illnesses.</dc:description>
