<dc:description xml:lang="en">Presentation of our experience on 1000 cases of ureteral lithiasis treated over the last five years with ESWL, ureteroscopy and ureterolitotomy, distributed in three series of 396, 265 and 339 cases respectively. In the first series (396 cases), lumbar ureter calculi were treated with ESWL (dornier HM3) and iliopelvian calculi with ureteroscopy. In the second series (265 cases), all calculi were treated with ESWL (Siemens Lithostar). The third series was in turn subdivided in three groups: in the first group, comprising simple ureteral calculi, 'in situ' ESWL was performed; in the second group, of lumbar ureter complex calculi, ESWL was performed assisted by simple endourological techniques; ureteroscopy was performed in the third group, iliopelvian ureter complex calculi. Calculi characteristics (site, size, consistency and number), excretory tract and renal function, designated as CEP/LTS-X were assessed. These parameters allow us to grade ureteral lithiasis in Types I, II and III. A comparative study of the results in the three series was made reaching an overall conclusion that simple or Type I ureteral lithiasis can be treated with 'in situ' ESWL as first choice; in Type II or lumbar ureter complex lithiasis, 'in situ' ESWL is insufficient and other endoeurological support techniques are required, while in Type III, iliopelvian ureter complex lithiasis, ureteroscopy should be recommended.</dc:description>
