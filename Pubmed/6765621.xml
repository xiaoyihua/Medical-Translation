<dc:description xml:lang="en">A concentrate of milk-clotting enzyme was produced by culture of Mucor bacilliformis on wheat bran medium moistened to 120% water on dry bases with HC1 2 N solution. The wheat bran was autoclaved, spread on trays and inoculated with 5.10(6) spore/gr of dry bran. After 10 days of culture at 21 degrees C, the enzyme produced was extracted with water and adjusted to pH 4.4. The precipitation was performed with ethanol. The precipitate was dissolved in HCl solution (pH 4.5) and it was concentrated by dialysis against polyethylene glycol 20.000. The enzyme solution had a specific activity of 1123 units/mg. and it was tested in the elaboration of cream cheese.</dc:description>
