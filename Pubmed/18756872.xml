<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Despite its increasing popularity, laparoscopic appendectomy does not put an unanimous end to the answer to the best treatment for appendicitis. Although the postoperative stay is shorter, the wound infection practically does not exist and scars are minimal, some publications question its advantages due to the incidence of intra-abdominal absceses, postoperative analgesia requirements and the recently described "postlaparoscopic appendectomy complication" (PLAC), an intra-abdominal infection, without abscess formation, which develops after laparoscopic appendectomy for non-complicated appendicitis. Some of this series include the "learning curve", wherein they compare results of inexperienced surgeons in laparoscopic techniques with those obtained after with the firmly established open appendectomy (OA) technique. With the aim to clarify this aspects, we reviewed our experience in laparoscopic appendectomy during (LDC) and after (LAC) the "learning curve" and we compared their complications with the open appendectomies' ones. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 807 appendectomies: 208 laparoscopic (LA) and 599 open (OA) from January 2001 to December 2007 performed in our hospital. In the laparoscopic group, 83 of them (40%) were done during the learning curve (each surgeon's 35 first interventions, LDC) and 125 (60%) after the learning curve (LAC). We have compared both laparoscopic subgroups to each other and to the open appendectomies group. We analysed the age, sex, length of stay, kind of appendicitis (simple or perforated appendicitis) and five of the most serious complications: intra-abdominal abscess, postoperative intestinal occlusion, intestinal perforation, haemorrhage and PLAC. RESULTS The mean age (9 years), sex (58% men; 42% women) and the peritonitis rate (30%) were similar among the 3 groups. The mean length of stay was reduced from 5.4 days in OA group to 4.2 days in LA group and 3.6 days in LAC group (p &lt; 0.01). The simple appendicitis cases had the shortest length of stay: 3.41 days in OA group and 2.16 days in LA group (p &lt; 0.0001). There were no differences in stay for the peritonitis group. In the OA group, we detected 56 severe complications (9,3%): 49 abcesses, 2 occlusions, 2 PLAC, 1 haemorrhage, 1 intestinal perforation and 1 liver abscess. Nineteen severe complications were found in LDC group (22,9%): 9 abscesses, 4 occlusions, 4 haemorrhages, 1 intestinal perforation and 1 PLAC (p &lt; 0.01 vs OA group). In the LAC group, we found 13 complications (10,4%): 9 abscesses, 1 occlusion, 1 PLAC and 2 haemorrhages (p = 0.3 vs OA group). CONCLUSIONS 1. The length of stay was significantly reduced in laparoscopic appendectomies. 2. Severe complications, particularly intestinal occlusions and haemorrhages, increased significantly during the learning curve, with a slight fluctuation for intra-abdominal abscesses and PLAC. 3. After the learning curve, complications' global rate was similar to the OA group's, with an increment of haemorrhages and occlusions, no variation for PLAC and a slight reduction for intra-abdominal abscesses. 4. In our experience, laparoscopic appendectomy after the learning curve is the best therapeutic option for acute appendicitis.</dc:description>
