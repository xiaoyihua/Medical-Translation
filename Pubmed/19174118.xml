<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Heliox is a helium-oxygen mixture which improves laminar flow and decreases airway resistance and the work of breathing. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of salbutamol or epinephrine nebulization driven by heliox in infants with moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective, observational, interventional, controlled and randomized study included ninety-six children who came to our pediatric emergency department with first episode of moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis. The patients were randomized to receive salbutamol or epinephrine nebulized with either oxygen (control group) or heliox (70% helium and 30% oxygen) as the driving gas. Heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry oxygen saturation and clinical score were measured before and after the treatment period. We also reported hospitalization rates and the number of patients who returned to the emergency department in the following seventy two hours. RESULTS There were no significant differences between both groups. The only statistically significant difference was that, in the heliox group, patients with severe bronchiolitis needed a lower number of nebulizations than infants in the control group. CONCLUSIONS According to our study, heliox-driven salbutamol or epinephrine is not an effective therapy in patients with acute bronchiolitis.</dc:description>
