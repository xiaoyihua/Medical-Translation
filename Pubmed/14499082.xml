<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Surgical neck exploration of the 4 parathyroid glands is quite an aggressive procedure for most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) due to a parathyroid adenoma. Intraoperatory measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) seems to be a useful tool for the management of these cases, allowing the use of minimally invasive surgical techniques with a lower morbidity. Our aims was to assess the usefulness of PTH intraoperatory measurement for the surgical management of PHPT. PATIENTS AND METHOD We studied 27 consecutive patients, diagnosed with PHPT secondary to parathyroid adenoma. Localization studies included neck ultrasonography and Tc-MIBI scintigraphy. PTH at the stage of anesthesia induction as well as 5 and 10 minutes after the removal of the adenoma was determined. A PTH decrement greater than 50% at 10 minutes was considered as curative. PTH was measured by an immunoluminometric method (Advantage, Nichols). RESULTS In all cases, calcium levels were normal 24 hours after the operation, and therefore all them were considered as cured. PTH levels decreased more than 50% in all patients. In one case, PTH levels remained high after the exeresis of a preoperatively localized lesion. The pathologic study confirmed that it was a normal parathyroid gland. We then continued the surgical exploration which eventually allowed us to find a contralateral adenoma. A further PTH measurement showed an over 50% decrease. Therefore, PTH was predictive of surgical success in all 28 measurements. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperatory determination of PTH is useful for the surgical management of PHPT and it could allow the use of minimally invasive surgical techniques.</dc:description>
