<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the assessment of the female pelvis, with special reference to the technical aspects. METHODS Our experience and the literature on MRI in the evaluation of the female pelvis are reviewed. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS Conventional MRI assessment, which includes T1- and T2-weighted images in the axial, sagittal and coronal planes and T2 acquisitions along the major axis of the uterus in the sagittal plane, has proved effective in evaluating different pathologies of the female pelvis. MRI is particularly effective in staging endometrial carcinoma and in determining myometrial or cervical invasion. It is also useful in determining parametrial invasion in cervical carcinoma. In ovarian disease, MRI has been used in detecting peritoneal involvement, adenopathies and to characterize the lesion. It is particularly useful for planning the surgical approach in congenital disease. The high resolution of MRI with the use of the new coils has enhanced its efficiency and effectiveness in the diagnosis of congenital anomalies and tumors of the female urethra, and in the evaluation of prolapse of the urinary bladder and urinary incontinence.</dc:description>
