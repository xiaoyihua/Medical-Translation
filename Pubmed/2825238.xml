<dc:description xml:lang="en">The 2-day-old rat is known to be susceptible to infection by ip route with the XJ strain of Junin virus but resists inoculation with XJC13 strain (85% vs 15% mortality). In order to determine whether peritoneal macrophages play a role in modulating the course of infection, viral replication in adherent peritoneal cells infected with either strain was studied. XJ was found to replicate 30-fold as regards XJC13 at day 3 pi. Besides, silica blockage of peritoneal macrophages was also evaluated. Following silica treatment, 60% survival was recorded for XJ-infected animals vs 15% for untreated infected controls. No significant differences were recorded for silica-treated XJC13-infected rats vs untreated infected controls. These preliminary findings indicate that, upon replication within the host's macrophages at the peritoneal inoculation site, virus spreads readily to reach the target organs. Effective silica blockage lends support to this pathway, as shown by significantly greater survival in XJ-infected rats.</dc:description>
