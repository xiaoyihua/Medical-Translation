<dc:description xml:lang="en">The birth of a premature infant creates anxiety and uncertainty for the parents, who may go through the same grieving process as parents who have lost a baby. Breastfeeding is considered a natural act, although it is not always an easy one for mother and premature infant to establish. Providing breast milk is one of the most important psychological benefits a mother can give her premature infant. Breast milk can be considered the ideal nutrition for preterm infants. Involving the parent in the child's care helps increase parental feelings of control. Neonatal nurses are in a unique position to help minimize parental stress by providing information. It is the responsibility of health professionals who care for premature infants to provide accurate information regarding the benefits and methods of breastfeeding, so that the mother can make an informed choice. The existence of a standardized care plan could assist in establishing breastfeeding in the pre-term newborn, to unify and guide practitioners in making decisions. The aim of this article is to describe the actions needed to be made by nursing staff to achieve successful breastfeeding. We present a standardized care plan that follows the NANDA (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association), NOC (Nursing Outcomes Classification), and NIC (Nursing Interventions Classification) and show how these needs could be managed by nursing professionals.</dc:description>
