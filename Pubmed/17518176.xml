<dc:description xml:lang="en">The trachea of a 39-year-old man ruptured following intubation for fiberoptic bronchoscopy; the complication became evident during surgery as extensive subcutaneous emphysema developed. The emphysema resolved with conservative treatment. Tracheobronchial lesions are generally caused by direct trauma to the chest. Tracheal rupture due to intubation maneuvers is one of the complications anesthetists fear most. Although infrequent, such lesions are potentially fatal. Signs and symptoms can vary widely, from self-limiting asymptomatic subcutaneous emphysema immediately following surgery to severe complications such as tension pneumothorax, acute respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum, or even pneumopericardium. The absence of complications in patients treated conservatively has increased interest in using this approach to management when conditions are favorable, always with fiberoptic assessment to evaluate whether the lesion has resolved completely and without sequelae.</dc:description>
