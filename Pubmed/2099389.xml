<dc:description xml:lang="en">Based on results of a diagnostic test which measured the knowledge that University of Chile students of 5 different health careers have a food and nutrition (1982), the nutrition program of the school of Dentistry was modified from a traditional system of education (formal classes) to a participative methodology in 1984, a didactic material on nutritional recommendations. An increased level of knowledge as well as motivation was observed in those graduating in 1984, particularly the area of nutritional recommendation and diet, to which the students spent more extra time. We can conclude that the educational methodology that stresses participation and is centered around one person is very effective to teach nutrition in the school of Dentistry.</dc:description>
