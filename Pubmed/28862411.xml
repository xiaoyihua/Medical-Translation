<dc:description xml:lang="en">Pseudocurimata boulengeri is an endemic species of Ecuador, which sustains a large group of fisher families. The biological data of this species correspond to reports from lotic systems of Los Ríos province; nevertheless, their trend in a lentic system is not yet known. This paper describes the sex ratio, length-weight relationship, gonad development, spawning season and size at reproductive maturity of P. boulengeri, inhabiting the lentic system of Chongón dam, Ecuador. Fish were caught between 2003 and 2009 using gill nets (2.5"). The total length (Lt) of caught specimens ranged from 10.5 to 35.5 cm, spawning occurred between the months of October and March, and size at first maturity for females was estimated at 17.9 cm (Lt) and 20.0 cm (Lt) for males. Between May and October male and female ratios were as expected (1:1), whereas for May, November and April, females ratios were higher than males, situation that coincided with the spawning season. The limnetic conditions and high production characteristics of Chongón dam, have promoted the availability of a great amount of food for this species, which may have allowed P. boulengeri to have a more extended reproductive season in this favorable environment.</dc:description>
