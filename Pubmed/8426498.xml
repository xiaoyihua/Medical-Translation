<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The possible positive correlation between the presence of antiribosomic antibodies and neurologic and neuropsychiatric manifestations in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, cited in the literature, was analyzed. METHODS Neurological involvement (current or previous) was evaluated in 71 successive patients. The anti-ENA antibodies (extractable nuclear antigens) were studied with special attention to the antiribosomic antibodies by: a) indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) on triple rat substrate, Hep2 and Crithidia luciliae; b) counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIE); c) double immunodiffusion (DI), and d) Western blot (WB) in the Molt-4 cell line. The statistical study was performed by the Fisher exact test. RESULTS RibosomAL dyeing was observed in only 2 patients by IFI on triple rat substrate and HEp2. With CIE and DI, 14 patients (20%) were anti-ENA positive. Detectable bands were obtained with WB in 47 patients (66%) with 9 corresponding to antiribosomic antibodies. No statistical differences were found (p &gt; 0.3) in relation with the presence of antirobosomic antibodies in particular and anti-ENA in general, between the groups with and without neurologic involvement. CONCLUSIONS No relation was observed between antiribosomic antibodies and neurolupus by determinations of anti-ENA antibodies by Western blot (superior method--p &lt; 0.0001--to direct immunofluorescence, counter immunoelectrophoresis and double immunodiffusion in the comparative study of sensitivity.</dc:description>
