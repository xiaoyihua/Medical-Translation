<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Polycystic ovary syndrome is a complex and heterogeneous disease involving both reproductive and metabolic problems. It has been suggested a genetic predisposition in the etiology of this syndrome. The identification of calpain-10 gene (CAPN10) as the first candidate gene for type 2 diabetes mellitus, has focused the interest in investigating their possible relation with the polycystic ovary syndrome, because this syndrome is associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, two metabolic abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. OBJECTIVE To investigate if there is association between the SNP-63 and the variant indel-19 of the CAPN10 gene and polycystic ovary syndrome in women of reproductive age. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study included 101 women (55 with polycystic ovary syndrome and 46 without polycystic ovary syndrome). The genetic variant indel-19 was identified by electrophoresis of the amplified fragments by PCR, and the SNP-63 by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS The allele and genotype frequencies of the two variants do not differ significatly between women with polycystic ovary syndrome and control women group. The haplotype 21 (defined by the insertion allele of indel-19 variant and C allele of SNP-63) was found with higher frequency in both study groups, being more frequent in the polycystic ovary syndrome patients group, however, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.8353). CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that SNP-63 and indel-19 variant of the CAPN10 gene do not represent a risk factor for polycystic ovary syndrome in our patients group.</dc:description>
