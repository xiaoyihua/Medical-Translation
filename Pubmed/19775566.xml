<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED OBJECTIVE. To analyze total APACHE III score association to pressure ulcers development in patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU). MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective cohort study conducted in an intensive care unit of the Hospital General de VIC. All the patients hospitalized between January 2001 to December 2001 were enrolled. Age, gender, length of stay, total Norton and APACHE III score and pressure sore development were collected. RESULTS Pressure sore incidence was 12.5% of the patients. The factors were significantly associated with the appearance of pressure sores in those patients with a length of stay in the intensive care unit, total Norton and severity of the disease measured by the APACHE III score. Patients having the greatest risk of pressure ulcers development were those whose Norton score was less than or equal to 14, and an APACHE III score higher than or equal to 50 (Odds Ratio: 37.9, 95% CI 11.16-128.47) CONCLUSION The severity of the diseases measured with the APACHE III scale showed a relationship with the appearance of in-hospital pressure ulcers. The joint use of the APACHE III and Norton scale could be a good strategy to detect patients with very high risk of suffering pressure sores.</dc:description>
