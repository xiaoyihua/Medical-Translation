<dc:description xml:lang="en">The epidemiological study of post-traumatic epilepsy after 10 years of follow-up on the island of Mallorca is reported. The double prospective and retrospective method was used for patient selection. Prospectively, 23,082 isolated head injuries were studied in the Hospital of Son Dureta in Palma de Mallorca between the years 1980 to 1988. Retrospectively, 663 epileptics proceeding from different data bases of different centers were studied. Two hundred and twelve post-traumatic epilepsies of certain etiology were identified. Results are discussed with regard to age, sex and latency time found. Special emphasis is made in that benign cerebral concussion is not causing seizures. A prevalence of 4% of post traumatic epilepsy is found in the population of risk head injuries, and post-traumatic epilepsy represents 7% of the total of the casuist of epileptic patients.</dc:description>
