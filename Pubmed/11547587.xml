<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify the reproductive timing, intensity, and rhythm of the Embera, (Eyabida, Dobida, and Chamibida subgroups) and Zenues ethnic groups. MATERIAL AND METHODS A sociodemographic study was conducted during 1996-1997 in Antioquia, Colombia, on a non-random population sample, stratified by ethnic group, to compare reproductive behaviors within and between these ethnic groups. Statistical analysis for independent samples was conducted using the software program Epi-Info. Analysis included the Student's t test for difference of means, and the chi-squared test for difference of proportions. RESULTS Reproductive behavior was characterized by ages at first intercourse of 14.5 and 15.8 years; the average interval before pregnancy was 1 to 1.3 years, followed by 48% to 73.3% of short-spaced intergenesic intervals. Reproductive stress was 50% during reproductive life, reaching an accelerated rhythm at 30-34 years of age, with a high fecundity ratio averaging 10.5 births, except for the better educated Chamibida that had 4 births on average. CONCLUSIONS Mainstream health policies directed at controlling birthrates are far from appropriate because they do not take into account the specific reproductive behaviors of these ethnic groups.
