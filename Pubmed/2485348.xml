<dc:description xml:lang="en">Study of 40 patients with no digestive pathology, 20 of whom were subjected to surgery of the larynx or maxillo-facial surgery, with regard to tolerance of an enteral diet with polysaccharides of soya which contribute 25 gr of dietetic fibre per 2,000 kilocalories, compared to that of an enteral diet poor in fibre and very often used due to good clinical tolerance. An increase in the frequency of bowel movement was observed, and in the quantity of motions, although there was no simultaneous change in number of motions per day, consistency or appearance of the faeces. Subjective tolerance to the diet was good, and patients felt less full and bloated than those on a diet which was poor in fibre. There were no significant differences between both diets with regard to nitrogen balance or plasmatic levels in the diet. The better tolerance of this diet with polysaccharides of soya leads us to recommend it, especially in patients with great needs with regard to energy or volume, provided that there are no malabsorption symptoms.</dc:description>
