<dc:description xml:lang="en">Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt-stent (TIPS) was performed in 5 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Bleeding varices occurred in 4 patients and refractory ascites in one. We used 2 Wallstents and 3 Strecker stents. Shunt patency, recurrent variceal hemorrhage and ascites were evaluated. The shunts were created from a transjugular approach between the hepatic and portal vein, with diameters of 10 mm. Portal pressure was adequately decreased in all cases. The hospital stay, following TIPS was 3 days. Complete variceal decompression was identified endoscopically in 3 patients, and partial in one. Four shunts were patent by ultrasound and color Doppler at 1 to 6 months of follow up. One patient presented encephalopathy and one died at third day after TIPS. Initial results suggest that TIPS is an effective method of portal decompression for treatment of variceal hemorrhage and refractory ascites. The main complication was encephalopathy and only one patient died.</dc:description>
