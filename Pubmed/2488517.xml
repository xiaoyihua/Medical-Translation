<dc:description xml:lang="en">We evaluated the results of peritoneal lavage and conservative surgery in 64 consecutive patients with severe acute pancreatitis, 73.4% of patients had associated cholelithiasis. Early resective surgery, specially in patients with necro-hemorrhagic pancreatitis and respiratory failure, was associated to a high mortality. Peritoneal lavage was started earlier in survivors and was effective in decreasing pain and amylase levels, but not in correcting hypoxemia. 29% of patients died in shock, which developed early and was mostly toxic in patients older than 50 as opposed to septic in younger patients. Actuarial survival rate was 50% at 1 month. Poor risk factors included admission after 48 hr, resective surgery, age greater than 50 years and failure to use peritoneal lavage.</dc:description>
