<dc:description xml:lang="en">As a result of a great deal of experimental and clinical research during the past 20 years, it is now clear that the final common pathway between central nervous system and anterior pituitary function is bridged by a new family of neurohormones, the so called hypothalamic hormones. These products released into the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system act directly on the adenohypophysis to increase or decrease the release of each of the known pituitary tropic hormones. The molecular structures of several of these hypothalamic hormones have been established and their synthesis achieved. Recent physiological studies have shown that they constitute an ideal tool with important clinical and veterinary applications.</dc:description>
