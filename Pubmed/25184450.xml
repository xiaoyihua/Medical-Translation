<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The study addressed risky sexual behavior regarding HIV infection in students attending Fundación Universitaria Luis Amigó (FUNLAM) in Medellin during the last six months. METHOD This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving a representative sample of 680 students who were surveyed using a questionnaire containing 65 qualitative and quantitative questions in line with sociodemographic variables and risky sexual behavior regarding HIV infection. RESULTS For each man who had had sexual contact during the past six months there were 0.50 women [PR 0.50: 0.32-0.76 CI] and regarding age there were 0.43 less than or equal to 20 year old students for each college student aged over 20 years old [PR 0.43: 0.29-0.64 CI]. Statistically significant differences were found when comparing psychology students to engineering students [PR 0.32: 0.15-0.69 CI] and when comparing tenth semester students to first, second and fourth semester students [PR 0.11: 0.01-0.88 CI; PR 0.07: 0.00-0.53 CI; PR 0.11: 0.14-0.86 CI, respectively]. CONCLUSION Sexual practice during the last six months was related to gender and age rather than other demographic variables showing the need to work with young people of both sexes, not just college students, for designing public health prevention and promotion action aimed at minimizing the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection.</dc:description>
