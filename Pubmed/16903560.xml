<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report a case of prostate lymphoma and a brief review of the literature. METHODS/RESULTS A 70 year-old mele patient was referred to the Urology departament with a clinical picture of prostatism, with acute urinary retention (AUR). Surgery with retropubic prostatectomy was performed, and pathology revealed a primary prostate lymphoma. The patient was referred to the departament of Oncology where he received polychemotherapy and radiotherapy. The patient is currently followed by regular visits to Urology outpatients service. The case study is followed by a brief bibliographic review, where we analyse clinical menifestations of this entity, complementary studies useful for diagnosis (laboratory test, trasrectal prostate biopsy, transuretral resection, ultrasound and computerised axial tomography), treatment options (surgery, polychemotherapy, radiotherapy) as well as survival in these patients. CONCLUSIONS Of the cases reviewed, mean age at diagnosis was 57 years. Clinical debut was with prostate symptoms, with or without AUR and sometimes manifestations of renal failure due to obstructive uropathy, as well as general symptoms (astenia, anorexia, weight loss). PSA values remain unaltered in prostate lymphoma patients. Histologic diagnosis may be made by transrectal prostate biopsy, although transurethral resection (TUR) may be necessary for confirmation. Ultrasound and CT scan are of great utility for diagnosis of both local and distant tumors. From a therapeutic point of view, surgery for the obstruction of the lower urinary tract (TURP or retropubic prostatectomy) may be necessary, as well as the cyclophosphamide based polychemotherapy with corticosteroids and other cytostatic agents, and radiotherapy; intratecal chemotherapy has also been used adjuvant bone marrow transplantation.</dc:description>
