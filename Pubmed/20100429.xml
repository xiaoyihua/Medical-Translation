<dc:description xml:lang="en">Vitality and inner resources as relevant components of psychological well-being. The multidimensional model of well-being, created by Carol Ryff, proposes the following dimensions to study psychological well-being (PSWB): self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth. One of the main criticisms aimed at this proposal is that it is based on excessive ethnocentrism in the operationalization of the PSWB construct linked to contemporary individual societies. Because of this, the first aim of this study was to extend the PSWB model with two dimensions: inner resources and vitality. Through a cross-validation approach, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed. The results showed better psychometric data in reliability and validity for the scales of the extended model of PSWB. To examine the PSWB construct in depth, we conducted a second study to analyze the relationship between the extended version of PSWB and subjective well-being models, and their predictive capacity of positive and negative human functioning, i.e., self-esteem and depression. Results showed complementation and compensation effects from both models that denote their close connection and singularity.</dc:description>
