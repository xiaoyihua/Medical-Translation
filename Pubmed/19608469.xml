<dc:description xml:lang="en">A descriptive review of 12 patients who underwent appendicocecostomy or caecostomy for antegrade colonic lavage from January 2002 to February 2008. There were 9 appendicocecostomies performed patients from 3 to 13 years suffering from myelomeningocele, of which 8 of them had a very good outcome, with one case withdrawn due to poor use by the family. Three caecostomies were performed in non-mentally retarded constipated children. One was an otherwise healthy 7 year-old boy with hard stools since he was 10 months old, in spite of multiple laxative treatments, with normal morphology and function. He had a percutaneous caecostomy five years ago, with some improvement and a good quality of life, but still some occasional partial impactions. Another healthy 12 year-old boy with daily constipation associated faecal incontinence since he was 3 years old (normal manometry and rectal biopsy with signs of mild neuronal dysplasia) had a percutaneous caecostomy performed three years ago, with improvement in the faecal incontinence and better psychological outcome. The last caecostomy patient was an 8-year-old boy, with a similar clinical history and good progress in last three years after placing a Chait's button using an endoscopic procedure. Stubborn constipation continuing into adult life has a negative impact on the social and emotional adaptation of the paediatric patient, affecting family interactions. Antegrade colonic lavage allows independence and improves the quality of life in patients affected by recurrent faecal impactions. This technique needs to be performed on more patients to find out its true effectiveness.</dc:description>
