<dc:description xml:lang="en">A survey was carried out to obtain an overview of the consumers' attitudes and opinions towards fish in Venezuela. The city of Caracas was selected for this purpose because of its size (4,000,000 inhabitants, the largest in Venezuela). The survey showed that consumers had a high regard for the nutritional value of fish compared with competing foods, but considered it low in taste, and disliked bones and smell. The percentage of people that did not consume any form of fish was 17.5 and the percentage of people who consumed fish four times or more per month, was 44.2. Of the people interviewed, 62% preferred to purchase fish directly from fishermen.</dc:description>
