<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To quantify the percentage of out-patient doses (OPD) of Digoxin taken by elderly people in treatment. DESIGN An observational, longitudinal and retrospective study. SETTING Out-patient clinics at a geriatric hospital. PATIENTS 67 patients were treated orally with Digoxin: 39 women; age 79 +/- 6; ideal weight, 55.7 Kg +/- 7.1; plasma creatinine, 1.3 +/- 0.9 mg/dl; in-hospital dose 3247.6 +/- 1309.4 ng/Kg; out-patient dose, 3205.7 +/- 1359.9 ng/Kg. They had two consecutive Digoxinemias, one in and one out of hospital, with an interval of 1 to 18 months between them. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Therapeutic compliance was calculated by comparing the Digoxinemia/dose relationship per Kg of the ideal in-hospital weight against the non-hospital one. 37.3% of the patients ingested 80 to 110% of the OPD (95% CI, 26.7%-49.3%). The 36 patients on a constant dosage took 74.3% +/- 34.1% of the OPD, whereas the 31 not on a daily dose took 87.7% +/- 25.3% (P &lt; 0.07). CONCLUSIONS Non-compliance is common and hard to detect clinically. Therefore, it is dangerous to adjust the dose of non-compliant patients only on the basis of Digoxinemias or effects of the medicine, or on the doctor's view about compliance.</dc:description>
