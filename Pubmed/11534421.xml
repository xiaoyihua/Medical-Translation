<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are replacing unfractionated heparin (UH) in treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVP), showing their security and effectiveness. METHODS To demonstrate their security and effectiveness a randomized prospective study was realised. It compared UH with LMWH in DP treatment, clinically diagnosed and confirmed with eco-Doppler. The study included 32 patients (21 males and 11 females); 15 received UH in continuos i.v. infusion and 17 sodic dalteparine, with dicumarinic afterwards in every case. The patients were followed for one year. RESULTS There were no differences between the two groups of treatment in clinical/radiological effectiveness either in short term nor one year follow up. There were no significative differences in side effects. CONCLUSION LMWH are as effective and safe as UH for DVT treatment. They also have a more comfortable dosage for the patient, avoiding the i.v. infusion and the coagulation test, which allows treatment at home.</dc:description>
