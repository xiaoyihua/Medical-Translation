<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this fifth chapter of the short history of the Spanish Society for Microbiology (SEM), the major activities carried out from 1987 to 1991 are described. During that period, the 11th, 12th and 13th SEM National Congresses took place in Gijón (1987), Pamplona (1989) and Salamanca (1991), respectively. The Specialized Groups of the Society organized their own meetings. Courses on the introduction to research in microbiology, for undergraduate students, started in that period. The President of SEM was elected FEMS Vice-president during the Council Meeting of the Federation of European Microbiological Societies (FEMS), held in Madrid in September 1989.</dc:description>
