<dc:title xml:lang="en">Histopathological findings in the oral mucosa of celiac patients</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Background: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible subjects. Although the small intestinal mucosa is the main site of the gut&#146;s involvement in CD, other mucosal surfaces belonging to the gastrointestinal tract and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue are known to be affected.  Aim: Assuming that the oral mucosa could reflect the histopathological inflammatory alterations of the intestine in CD patients, this study wishes to assess the pattern of T-cell subsets inthe oral mucosa of young adults with CD. Methods: A group of 37 patients (age range 20-38 years;  female: male ratio 28:9) with CD were enrolled. Out of 37 patients, 19 patients (group A) followed a gluten free diet (GFD) -2 patients from less than one year; 6 patients between 1 and 5 years; 11 patients more than 5 years- while 18 patients (group B) were still untreated. Fifteen healthy volunteers (age range 18-35 years, female: Male ratio 11:4) served as controls for the CD patients. Ethical approval for the research was granted by the Ethics Committee. Biopsy specimens were taken from normal looking oral mucosa. The immunohistochemical investigation was performed with monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, and &amp;#947;&amp;#948;-chains T cell receptor (TCR). Results: The T-lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate was significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) increased in group B (both compared  with group A and with the control group). Conclusion: This study confirms the oral cavity to be a site of involvement of CD and its possible diagnostic potentiality in this disease (AU)</dc:description>
