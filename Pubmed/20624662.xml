<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical profile and management of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in primary care. METHODS A multinational, multicenter study was performed comprising a 4-month retrospective phase for the screening, selection and assessment of patients who had consulted for any GERD-related cause (index visit), and a cross-sectional phase in which clinical data were recorded and the following questionnaires were administered: the Reflux Disease Questionnaire and the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Impact Scale (GIS). RESULTS Among the 24 participating Spanish centers, 2.7% of the patients (95% CI: 2.6-2.9) had consulted at least once because of GERD. Approximately 50% of the patients showed frequent (2 or more days a week) or moderate to severe symptoms of heartburn, acid regurgitation or chest pain. Although the patients received effective pharmacological treatment at the index visit, clinically relevant GERD symptoms persisted in 16% after a median follow-up of 5 months. These symptoms were associated with a strong disease impact as evaluated with the GIS. CONCLUSION GERD represents a substantial burden for primary care physicians. Although effective drugs are used for the treatment of this condition, clinically relevant symptoms persist in a substantial proportion of patients.</dc:description>
