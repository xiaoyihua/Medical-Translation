<dc:description xml:lang="en">The cases of hyperlipoproteinemic secondary type IV are manifested by elevation of triglycerides, with normal or high cholesterol and lightly high homocysteine. The effect of vitamins B12, B6 and folic acid, on homocysteine and lipids, in 24 male patients, 35-68 years, with hiperlipoproteinemia secondary type IV with myocardial isquemic, and without previous treatment of hipolipemiant, was investigated. The patients were supplemented with therapeutic doses tablets of vitamin B12, 500 (microg/day); B6, (600 mg/day) and folic acid (20 mg/ day), during 120 days. Homocysteine, triglycerides, total and fractional cholesterol, at (basal), 30, 60, 90 and 120 days, were determined. Descriptive statistical analyses were applied, coefficient of correlation of Pearson and proves of "t", with a p &lt; 0.005; the data were processed by statistical program SPSS version 8.0. The results showed a decrease in the levels of homocysteine from basal 17.1 +/- 0.7 micromol/L to 13.18 +/- 0.83 micromol/L, at the end of experimental period. The triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) showed a reduction of (21.8 mg/dl; 8.5 mg/dl; 5.87 mg/dl; respectively) for every pmol/L of reduced homocysteine, with (p &lt; 0.001) for triglycerides. High density lipoprotein (HDL) increased 1.1 mg/dl and coronary risk descent in 24%. We concluded that therapeutic doses of vitamins B12, B6 and folic acid, may is effective in decreased plasmatic homocysteine levels and lipids, mainly triglycerides, with a reduction of coronary risk, to these type of patients, with not collateral effects of neuropathy</dc:description>
