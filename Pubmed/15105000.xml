<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Brain death is the irreversible cessation of intracranial neurologic function and is considered as the person's death. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of pediatric donors in the Hospital Central de Asturias from October 1995 to October 2002. METHODS We performed a retrospective and descriptive study of the dead children who were potential donors in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). RESULTS Of 43 dead children, 15 (34.9 %) were diagnosed with brain death. In four patients (family refusal in one, sepsis in two and brain tumor in one) there was no donation. In all patients, the diagnosis of brain death was based on clinical examination and electroencephalogram. Doppler ultrasonography and technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamineoxamine (Tc-99-HMPAO) scanning was also performed in three and nine patients respectively. The mean age of the donors was 8.1 years (range: 13 months-15 years). The male/female ratio was 3/1. The cause of death was multiple trauma in six children, brain hemorrhage in three, cardiac arrhythmias in three, lightning strike in one, diabetic ketoacidosis in one, septic shock in one and hypovolemic shock in one. The median interval between admission and brain death was 1.4 days (range: 3 hours-12 days). The time of organ support between brain death and donation was 8.4 hours (range: 6-13 hours). The most frequent complications after brain death were central diabetes insipidus in 90.9 % of the patients, hyperglycemia in 54.5 % and hypokalemia in 45.4 %. During support 72.7 % of the patients required inotropic aid. CONCLUSIONS In our PICU more than one-third of the dead children suffered brain death, and most became donors. The most frequent cause of brain death was multiple trauma. Coordination with the transplant team and the training of medical staff are important to achieve a high percentage of donations.</dc:description>
