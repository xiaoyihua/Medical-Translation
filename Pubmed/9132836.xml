<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Deficiencies in ATIII, PC, and PS are associated with a higher incidence of thromboembolic events. An analysis was made of these three proteins in 239 cases of non-embolic stroke; the incidence of their deficiency and the presence of intersexual variations were evaluated. Two different methods were used to measure PS, functional PS and free PS, comparing the values and the incidence of the deficiency. RESULTS ATIII, PC, free PS, and functional PS deficiencies were found in 2.93%, 7.5%, 9.52% and 13.72%, respectively. The observed PS values showed statistically significant differences between sexes. CONCLUSION There was a higher incidence of PS and PC deficiencies in patients with stroke, which were associated with a poorer prognosis. PS differed between sexes and both methods were valid for its quantitation.</dc:description>
