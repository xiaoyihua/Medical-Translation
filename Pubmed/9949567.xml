<dc:description xml:lang="en">Schizophrenia, a psychiatric disease that is highly prevalent among the general population, has polymorphic clinical manifestations at onset and during its evolution. The most frequent manifestations are an abrupt onset with positive symptoms, perception and thought disorders, which were included by Kurt Schneider in the first range symptoms. However, on other occasions the onset is insidious and the so-called negative symptoms are present, resulting in clinical manifestations that are similar to the state of absence and a less favorable patient prognosis. Since the last century when Kraepelin defined early dementia, various authors have tried to explain the nature of this disease, resulting in Bleauler's definition of the fundamental symptoms. A clinical case of hebephrenic schizophrenia is presented in which disorders in thought, affect and volition predominated. We discuss the psychopathological views of less well-known, but not for that reason less important, authors, such as Guirod and Dice, and the similarities and differences between their views and current classifications.</dc:description>
