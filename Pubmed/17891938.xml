<dc:description xml:lang="en">Treatment with bisphosphonates (BP) improves the quality of life of patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Beneficial effects are the relief of bone pain, a reduction of fracture incidence, improvement of corporal mobility and recovery of normal vertebral form. Treatment is less effective after completion of growth [corrected] An update of the literature is here presented. A number of important unsolved questions have been pointed out: for how long should treatment be instituted? Is the oral route as effective as the intravenous one? Which is the best dose? When treatment should be stopped? How well preserved is the longterm integrity of the bones? Which are the phenomena occurring in bone tissue after interruption of therapy?</dc:description>
