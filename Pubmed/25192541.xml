<dc:description xml:lang="en">Pyloric atresia is a rare malformation of the alimentary tract. Fetal gastric dilatation and polihydramnios are the main prenatal sonographic findings. In 20% of the cases epidermolysis bullosa is associated. This is a group of genetic anomalies affecting the skin and mucous membranes, which appear fragile and easily blistering. Therefore, this association should be investigated as soon as pyloric atresia is prenatally suspected. The "snow flake" sonographic sign in the amniotic fluid and some irregularities in the fetal's ears could be found and should motivate the investigation of those gene mutations known to be related to epidermolysis bullosa, in order to accomplish an appropriate familial counseling. The parents would be carriers of certain mutation and 25% of the siblings will be affected. A newborn with pyloric atresia will soon exhibit non-bilious vomiting and distention of the upper abdomen. A huge gastric dilatation and a gasless intestine will be apparent in the abdominal plain x-ray. Pyloric atresia is a surgically resolvable malformation. We present herein three patients with this infrequent anomaly.</dc:description>
