<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two groups of children, thirteen years of age, were given a questionnaire to study their attitudes towards alcohol consumption and alcoholism. The children belonged to two different socio-economical levels: low and high, and were selected at random, in the zone "Oriente" of the National Health Service, Chile. The analysis of answers was made along three directions: a) affective component; b) cognitive component; c) reactive component. The results show that children of low socio-economical level are more negative and rejective towards alcohol consumption than the others, and show more conflicts about it. Both groups reproduce adult patterns and opinions of their respective level. A future development of this type of research can be the criteria for prognosis in relation to early attitudes towards alcohol.</dc:description>
