<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Migraine is the most common neurological consultation in our country. AIM. To analyse the satisfaction level of the patient with migraine attending our clinics. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 160 neurologists asked 10 consecutive migraine patients to fill in a satisfaction questionnaire. RESULTS The questionnaire was answered by 1330 patients. The most important factors they considered for their neurologists were professional experience and kindness. Patients thought neurologist should improve in time to explain treatment and accessibility. Almost 90% of patients considered that treatments for migraine had improved, but almost half of them were not satisfied with the management in primary care setting. Patients were more satisfied with symptomatic treatment (69.1%) than with preventatives (50.4%). More than half had a neuroimaging study due to their headaches. Only half thought that such an study would improve their satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS The level of satisfaction of the migraine patient attending our clinics has improved in the last years. In patients' opinion the aspects which should be improved are the time to explain migraine and its treatment, accessibility and preventive treatment.</dc:description>
