<dc:description xml:lang="en">The frequency of essential tremor (ET) was determined in 102 unselected elderly patients aged 65 or over (average 73.9 +/- 9.1) admitted to the medical and surgical wards of a general hospital for non-neurological conditions. Patients bearing potential causes for symptomatic tremor were excluded. ET was observed in 10 individuals (9.8%) and in one a previously unrecognized Parkinson's disease (PD) was detected. The frequency of the ET increased linearly by age groups up to the age of 80 to decrease thereafter. In 30% of the cases the tremor did not involve the limbs, five had pathologically enhanced physiological tremor, one had type 2 ET and in one other a type 3 ET was combined with tremor of the head. No case had previously consulted because of the tremor and a positive family history for this was found in only 2 cases. In the overall group, a 4.9% affirmed to have a relative with tremor and in a further 3.9% a specific diagnosis of PD had been established in at least one relative. The occurrence of ET in first-degree family members was considerably lower, with a history of ET found in 1.5% out of 197 parents, 0.8% of 473 brothers and sisters and 0.3% out of 277 living sons and daughters. Our study indicates that a positive family history for tremor is commonly encountered in the general population, and a high percentage of elderly individuals may themselves exhibit ET albeit mild enough usually as not to warrant neurological consultation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
