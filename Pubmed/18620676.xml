<dc:description xml:lang="en">Haemophagocytic syndrome is a disease diagnosed according to clinical and analytical criteria, related to many infectious diseases. It is exceptionally described in patients infected with Leishmania. Visceral leishmaniasis is an uncommon disease in our country except in some areas where it is endemic. Its diagnosis is sometimes difficult and the use of other methods currently available is needed. Haemophagocytic syndrome treatment is based on established chemotherapy protocols, but when it is secondary to Visceral Leishmaniasis, it may be an exception, since the abnormalities can be resolved by treatment of the infection itself. This treatment has improved recently as Liposomal Amphotericin B has replaced classic antimonials, being more beneficial due to less adverse effects and a shorter treatment time.</dc:description>
