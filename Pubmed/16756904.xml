<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE We intended to estimate the prevalence of reactive arthritis (ReA) and other musculoskeletal sequelae after a foodborne outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis phago type 14 b in a banquet in Castellón in June 5th, 2004. PATIENTS AND METHOD A prospective cohort study was carried out with 125 subjects (90.6%) out of the banquet participants. Sixty-two symptomatic infected cases occurred, 33 with positive cultures of S. enteritidis phago type 14 b, and 54 non-infected subjects. After 4 months of the outbreak, all 125 subjects were studied by means of a symptoms questionnaire of ReA based on Buxton et al, administered by telephone. Medical examination of subjects with musculoskeletal symptoms, 29 of 30, was done by a rheumatologist. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated by Poisson regression models. RESULTS Any symptoms were reported by 32 (52%) of infected cases versus 13 (24%) of non-infected (RR adjusted = 2.49; 95% CI, 1.26-4.95); 20 (32%) infected cases reported muskuloskeletal symptoms compared to 4 (7%) non-infected (RR adjusted = 4.96; 95% CI, 1.64-15.04). The medical examination of the subjects with musculoskeletal symptoms revealed 3 infected cases with ReA (4.8%; 3/62). In addition, several reactive musculoskeletal sequelae associated with salmonellosis infection were found in 4 subjects (1 neck pain, 1 polyarthralgias, and 2 enthesopathy). CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of ReA was lower than other studies but the incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms was increased. The infection by Salmonella supposes a risk for joint symptoms that could be important taking into account the high incidence of salmonellosis.</dc:description>
