<dc:description xml:lang="en">By means of a retrospective study made of multiple centres, it was aimed to determine which variables could be influential at the moment of diagnosis in the prognostic of patients suffering neuroblastoma and medullary bone affection. Fifty four cases of patients belonging to a total of ten hospital centers have been revised in a period of five years. The ages under study spanned from three months to eight years of age (mean = 2.83 years). For the analysis of the patients, they were divided into two groups: one being composed of the deceased patients and the other of the surviving. The deceased patients were of a more advanced age, the delay in the diagnosis was greater, the primitive tumor was found to be more frequently located in the adrenal glands, the metastasis appeared more readily in multiples, and the effectiveness of the treatment was less, resulting in lower cases of remission and a less radical surgery. The only difference with respect to other publications is that in the case of surviving patients, the number of cases of enolase and ferritin is more frequently pathological.</dc:description>
