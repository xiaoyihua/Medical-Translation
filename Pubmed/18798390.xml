<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in cervicovaginal fluid in a pseudocohort that emulates the evolution of the labor. MATERIAL AND METHOD Samples of cervicovaginal fluid of patients with 20 to 40 weeks of gestation were taken, patients were classified in 5 strata of the development of the labor. Each stratum reflects the progressive activation of the uterine activity and the cervical changes. To each sample was made determination of IL-6 by means of the system Multiplex. The samples of patient with infection data were eliminated. RESULTS 173 samples were included distributed in each one of the five strata. Basal secretion exists of IL-6 to the cervicovaginal fluid along the gestation, that doesn't modify until the active labor appears. Only when the uterine activity is manifested in form to regulate and effective, very significant increase is documented in the concentration of the IL-6 in the cervicovaginal fluid. CONCLUSIONS The IL-6 it is a proinflammatory cytokine that increases in a specific way in the moment in that the effective uterine activity begins, thus, it is an excellent candidate to be evaluated as marker presage of the event of normal labor and preterm.</dc:description>
