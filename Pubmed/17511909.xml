<dc:description xml:lang="en">Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension occurs in very few patients who have had history of a previous acute thromboembolic episode. However, its incidence has increased in recent years, actually not being so rare at all. Advances have been made in the pathophysiology, diagnostic approach and therapeutic alternatives as well what can be offered to those patients who are not suitable candidates for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, which is definitive, curative and the treatment of choice in this subtype of pulmonary arterial hypertension. This review focuses on the diagnostic approach and novel pharmacological therapies in patients who are not candidates for surgery.</dc:description>
