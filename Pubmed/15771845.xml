<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the present article, we first describe the most frequent psychological alterations provoked by terrorist attacks. Subsequently, we describe the organization and interventions carried out on 11 March by the Department of Psychiatry of our hospital to attend both the victims of the attacks and their families, as well as the follow-up of victims after 11 March. The department's psychiatrists and psychologists were distributed through the distinct departments of the hospital to attend the first patients admitted and their relatives and two psychologists were specifically designated to attend the relatives of the few deceased who were transferred to the hospital.</dc:description>
