<dc:description xml:lang="en">The microbiology laboratory should be a safe, efficient, and comfortable place for those working there, and a pleasant place for visitors. According to the ISO 15189 standard, it should be spacious enough for the workload to be carried out without jeopardizing quality or the safety of the persons present, whether workers or visitors, and provide optimal comfort to all occupants. In addition, the setup should respect the privacy of patients, and provide controlled access to the different laboratory areas and a safe place for storing clinical samples, manuals, and reagents. In the design of the facilities, the needs of specialists, technicians, and other personnel must converge, without forgetting patients, their relatives, and other visitors. The clinical microbiology laboratory has certain characteristics that make it different from other diagnostic laboratories. Its main activity involves isolation, propagation, and handling of pathogenic microorganisms that pose a risk to the laboratory personnel. To minimize this risk, the laboratory must meet a certain level of biosafety. Moreover, correct interpretation of microbiological cultures depends on the capacity of the laboratory to avoid or minimize the presence of contaminants; hence, proper handling of samples and cultures (aseptic conditions, biosafety cabinet) is mandatory. A number of documents and regulations, from very general to highly specific (biosafety), affect the design of the microbiology laboratory. The aim of this report is to establish the minimum requirements and recommendations for designing clinical microbiology laboratories, based on a review of current regulations. It is contemplated as an aid to microbiology specialists who are designing or planning to reform their laboratories.</dc:description>
