<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report our experience with 8 women with perineal endometriosis managed in a period of 20 years. All were multiparae women presenting with cyclical perineal painful masses related to menstrual periods. Symptomatology started 6 months to 16 years after last delivery. Three patients had partial involvement of the anal sphincter. The endometriosis area was locally resected in all women. There were no complications and no problems with anal continence. Two patients had local recurrences. The different lapses between delivery and symptomatic presentation can be related to the amount of endometrial basal cells implants in the episiotomy. The treatment is always surgical. All endometrial implants must be resected and sphincteric structures must be repaired posteriorly.</dc:description>
