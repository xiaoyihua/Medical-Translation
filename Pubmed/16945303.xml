<dc:description xml:lang="en">The hospital is an enterprise in which the surgery department represents a specific healthcare unit. The purpose of the surgery department, like that of any other enterprise, is assumed to be indefinite survival; to that end, it must be able to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage in the long term. Nevertheless, each surgery department, like each enterprise, can precisely define the scope of the above-mentioned terms, the main source of an enterprise's competitive advantage being its knowledge stock. Knowledge is recognized as being the basis of competitive success among institutions. This article presents the concept and classification of knowledge and discusses how it should be identified, inventoried, and managed. Special emphasis is placed on healthcare activity, since this sector presents certain characteristics distinguishing it from other sectors of economic and business activity.</dc:description>
