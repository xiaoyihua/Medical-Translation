<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE Determine the rate of markers of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses in patients with terminal chronic kidney failure (TCKF) prior to the start of a chronic hemodialysis program (CHD), and assess the time relation between infection and epidemiological history. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective and analytical study. The study population was composed of the entire group of TCKF patients using the CHD program for the first time at the HNCH, Lima, from June 2002 to September 2003. HbsAg and HBV Anti-HBc, and HCV anti-VHC markers were assessed. RESULTS 86 patients were studied, 45 female (52.3%) and 41 male (47.7%). During the study, the total rate of HBV markers was 20.9%, HBsAg(+) was 2.3%, and anti-HBcT(+) was only 18.7%. Anti-HCV rate was 4.65%. Related factors for potential carriers of only anti-HBcT(+) were: elder age, sexual intercourse with prostitutes OR=6.1 (1.5-25.3), food consumption at restaurants OR=5.2 (1.6-16.4), or being born in the jungle area OR=6.7 (1.5-30.5). Multi-variance analysis showed that only elder age OR=1.03 (1.00-1.06), being born in the jungle area OR=13.1 (1.8-91.1), and food consumption in restaurants OR=5.0 (1.4-18.0) were related to total anti-HBc count. CONCLUSIONS The study results suggest a low rate of serological markers of HBV and HCV in TCKF patients using chronic hemodialysis treatment for the first time at HNCH.</dc:description>
