<dc:description xml:lang="en">At Instituto Nacional de la Nutrición SZ in Mexico City, we reviewed 30 years of experience and selected 46 patients with Pancreatic Diabetes (PD), without family history of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) with at less two years of follow-up. Alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (CP) was found in 36 patients, in seven it was idiophatic and in three was secondary to pancreatectomy. We compared the evolution of this patients with a group of (DM) patients similar in age, sex, glucemic control and time of onset. There were no statistical differences between groups in the follow-up of diabetic complications, only it was found a tendency to have higher lipid levels, macroangiopathy and retinopathy in those with DM. We concluded that CP have similar evolution as DM and could have deleterous complications in the large follow up.</dc:description>
