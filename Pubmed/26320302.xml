<dc:description xml:lang="en">Consuming fruits and vegetables is known to lower blood pressure. However, it is unclear how much should be consumed in order to achieve this effect. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and blood pressure. A cross-sectional study was conducted among a random sample of 777 adults between the ages of 32 and 38 from the Region of Valparaiso, Chile. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured, and a survey was carried out to quantify consumption trends over the past month. The fruit and vegetable intake was divided into three groups: less than 200 g, 200-400 g, and more than 400 g. In the analysis, multiple linear regression models were used and were adjusted for sex, BMI, physical activity, socioeconomic status, smoking, and sodium intake. It was observed that increasing intake of fruits and vegetables lowers the systolic blood pressure (β = -3.37 , 95% CI : -6.45 to -0.29; for consumption between 200 and 400 g ) (β = -4.02, 95% CI: -7.06 to -0.98; for consumption great than 400 g), while an effect on diastolic pressure is only seen in those who meet the WHO recommendation of consuming more than 400 g per day (β -2.87, CI = -5.17 to -0.57). In conclusion, consuming fruits and vegetables in amounts larger than 400 g per day, provides a protective effect against increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</dc:description>
