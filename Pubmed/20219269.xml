<dc:description xml:lang="en">Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) has been proven to prevent infections of endogenous development and reduce mortality in critically ill patients under prolonged mechanical ventilation. Historical arguments against its use, like the development of bacterial resistance or the selection of resistant microorganisms and the absence of influence on mortality have not been confirmed. Moreover, recent clinical trials designed to evaluate these variables, show remarkable reductions in the incidence of resistant bacteria and a significant beneficial effect on mortality. Furthermore, no increases in workload or costs have been documented. A few studies with post-trial and intermediate range follow-up periods didn't find increases in resistance. Implementation of SDD requires motivation and leadership in order to achieve cooperation of other related hospital specialists, training of several categories of healthcare professionals, and continuous monitoring of results. In order to facilitate the use of SDD in the critically ill, this preventive measure should be incorporated in guidelines of national and international scientific societies and working groups involved in the care of the critically ill patient. The general implementation of SDD in our intensive care units must be accompanied by a registry in order to be able to monitor the effect on the incidence of infection and bacterial resistance. For this purpose, the Spanish national ICU infection and resistance surveillance programme ENVIN-HELICS, active over the last 15 years, constitutes both a more than adequate tool, and the convenient reference data base.</dc:description>
