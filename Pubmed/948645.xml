<dc:description xml:lang="en">The future agricultural development of Central America must be based of studies of land capacity in order to assure a sustained yield of the environment. The industrial development of the region, as well as the construction of the highways and rural roads must be carefully planned as a means of environmental conservation. New towns, housing developments, recreational facilities and highways should be planned to the effect that they occupy non-productive lands and thus minimize the modern trend of covering the best agricultural soils with concrete jungles. In recent years the price of agricultural lands has shown a tremendous rise, due mainly to the demand of land for urbanization. This situation has induced many farmers to abandon their lands, therefore, a selective land taxation system is suggested to encourage the cultivation of these suburban areas.</dc:description>
