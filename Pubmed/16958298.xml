<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To compare the plasmatic levels of free testosterone (FT), total testosterone (TT), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAs) obtained from women with pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and from uncomplicated pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy. METHODS FT, TT and DHEAs were measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma samples from 30 women with PIH (PIH group) defined as mean blood pressure &gt; or = 105 mm Hg, and proteinuria &gt; or = 100 mg/dL and &lt; 300 mg/dL, and in 30 women with uncomplicated pregnancies (control group). Gestational age at the time of the study in the PIH group was 37 weeks +2 days (28+0 - 40+1), and in the control group, 37 weeks +1 day (28+0 - 41+6). The plasmatic androgen levels and the perinatal outcome were analysed in both groups. RESULTS There was no difference in the gestational age at birth. In the PIH group there were increased number of caesarean sections due to fetal distress (PIH group; n = 10, control group; n = 2; p = 0.05), lower birthweight (PIH group 2549 g [800-3400 g], control group 3242 g [2400-4200 g]; p = 0.02) and increased number of neonatal intensive unit care admissions (PIH group; n = 3, control group; n = 0). In the PIH group, FT and TT levels were significantly higher than controls (mean, SD) (FT PIH group, 5.94 (0.9) pg/mL; FT control group, 0.44 (0.2) pg/mL; p = 0.002. TT PIH group, 5.28 (2.4) nmol/L; TT control group, 3.6 (0.6) nmol/L; p = 0.02. There was no difference in DHEAs levels between the groups (mean, SD) (PIH group, 51.13 (23.7) microg/dL; control group, 70.0 (13.5) microg/dL). CONCLUSIONS In women complicated with PIH there is an increment in the plasmatic levels of FT and TT. This might contribute to the clinical findings and the adverse perinatal outcome observed in this patients.</dc:description>
