<dc:description xml:lang="en">Medicine in 19th-century Brazil was a scientific field where traditional knowledge, academic teaching, and clinical care found themselves clashing with new theories of illness and medical care underpinned by pioneer disciplines like parasitology, bacteriology, and anatomopathology and an experimental clinical practice focused on tropical diseases which afflict the poor. This new set of theoretical and social references which affected public health-care policy saw its decadence when it was appropriated by an ideology that argued that the Afro-Brazilian population was racially and culturally inferior. Two new disciplines--criminal physical anthropology and legal medicine--contributed to the development of specialized knowledge within intellectual circles. At the same time, they were placed at the service of the ruling order, reinforcing principles and devices that the elite utilized to keep itself in power. This hybrid structure constitutes the legacy of barbarianism which is sundering today's civilization.</dc:description>
