<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess the effect of influenza vaccination on plasma HIV viral load and CD4 T-lymphocytes in patients with advanced HIV disease. PATIENTS AND METHOD Observational study carried out in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 cell count &lt; 200 X 10(6)on highly active antiretroviral therapy(HAART). Influenza vaccine was voluntarily offered and plasma viral load and CD4 cell counts were measured at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks in vaccinated and control subjects. RESULTS Sixteen patients were analysed, 10 of them being immunized with the influenza vaccine. A significant decline in CD4 cell counts at 4 and 12 weeks and an increasing trend of viral load were seen in all immunized patients who had a high viral load at the time of vaccination (n = 6), but not in those with an undetectable viral load. The mean decrease of CD4 T-lymphocytes in these 6 patients was 49.8%. Three patients showed a huge drop of the CD4 cell count (over 60% of baseline). CONCLUSIONS Influenza vaccination of severely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients who are failing to HAART might be associated with an immunological impairment.</dc:description>
