<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Appendiceal diverticulitis (AD) is a rare cause of acute appendicitis (AA) which is most frequently diagnosed after appendectomy in pathological study. OBJECTIVE To compare AA versus AD. METHODS Retrospective analytic study in avperiod of 51 months fom January 2009 to March 2013 in the Hospital Universitario San Juan de Alicante (Spain), including patients with clinical or radiological suspicious of acute appendicitis which was confirmed intraoperatively and with the pathological study. RESULTS We included 449 patients, 442 typical AA (98.5%) and 7AD (1.5%). DA was more frequent in women (57%) with a median age of 44 years old (range 37 to 57 years old), whereas AA was more frequent in men (61%) with a median age of 28 years old (range 15 to 46 years old). Leukocyte count, neutrophils and C-reactive protein were respectively 13,300 per mm3 (range 10,700 to 15,700 per mm3), 87.1% (range 84.6 to 89.6%) and 1.82 mg/dL (range 0.59 to 5.31 mg/dL) in AD versus 14,700 per mm3 (range 12,300 to 17,600 per mm), 81.6% (range 75.1 to 86.4%) and 2.71 mg/dL (range 0.67 to 75 mg/dL) in AA. Alvarado score and appendicitis diagnostic score were respectively 7 (range 6 to 8) and 6 (range 5 to 7) in AD and 7 (range 5 to 7) and 6 (range 5 to 6) in AA. An appendiceal perforation was seen in 3 AD (43%) and 80 AA (18%). CONCLUSION AD appeared in older patients with a clinical and blood test profile similar to AA but with a higher perforation rate.</dc:description>
