<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The quality of life is the perception of a patient about functional effects of his illness and therapy. Recently, appropriate instruments were devised to evaluate the health related with the quality of life, as the standardized and validated questionnaires for rhino-conjunctivitis. OBJECTIVE To determine the impact of integral allergological treatment upon the quality of life of patients with allergic rhinitis that were attended as outpatients at the Service of Allergy and Clinical Immunology of Hospital Universitario de Puebla. MATERIAL AND METHODS It was carried out a longitudinal, prospective, experimental and prolective study in patients of both sexes, older than 18 years old, with diagnosis of allergic rhinitis; life quality was evaluated by means of the application of a validated and standardized questionnaire every 15 days during 4 months. After being included in the study, patients received the integral allergological treatment conformed by educational measures, environmental control, pharmacotherapy and specific immunotherapy. We determined frequency for qualitative variables and average for quantitative variables. The averages were compared by means of variance analysis. The significance value was established down in 0.05. RESULTS Thirteen patients were included, 61.5% of them were male. The average age was 33.2 (SD 17.0). There was a significative difference in quality of life index when patient was included in comparison with the indexes in subsequent visits. The most frequent allergic rhinitis was the moderate-severe persistent type, with a 76.9% rate. CONCLUSION Integral allergological treatment improves quality of life of patients with allergic rhinitis.</dc:description>
