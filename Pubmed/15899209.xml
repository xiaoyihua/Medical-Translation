<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Extra-pulmonary small cell carcinoma (ESCC) is as a pathologic entity distinct from small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). ESCC is considered a systemic disease in its origin, so the therapeutic approach is similar to SCLC with chemotherapy being considered in case of extensive and local disease. We present a retrospective comparison of ESCC and SCLC in our institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS Using the tumour registry database of Hospital Universitario La Fe we reviewed 24 ESCC cases receiving attention between 1987 and 2003, and these were compared with a series of 341 patients with SCLC in the same institution. RESULTS Of the 24 patients with ESCC 19 were men and 5 were women with an average age of 58 years (range 23 to 85). The most frequent site was the mediastinum with 58% having extensive disease. All patients but one received treatment. The therapeutic approaches were local and systemic in 13 patients, systemic alone in 6 and local alone in 4. Schedules based on platinum and etoposide were used. The median follow-up was 53 months (range 4 to 211). Median survival was 18.9 months; 30 in patients with local disease and 8 in those with extensive disease. In the SCLC series of patients, there were 336 men and 5 women; 62% having extensive disease. The median survival was 10 months; 12 months in those patients with local disease and 8 in those with extensive disease. CONCLUSIONS The overall survival of patients with ESCC was slightly better than patients with SCLC. ESCC with local disease had a better survival outcome than SCLC with local disease. Chemotherapy is the cornerstone of the treatment, but sometimes local treatment could be sufficient.</dc:description>
