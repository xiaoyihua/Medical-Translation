<dc:description xml:lang="es">Background: Previous studies have shown that an increase in body mass index (BMI) is associated with a greater risk of obstetric complications. Aim: To investigate the effect of an increase in BMI category on obstetric outcomes in Hospital Clínic of the University of Chile. Material and methods: A retrospective study was conducted of women followed-up in the hospital from2001 to 2006. Women with singleton pregnancies were placed in standard BMI categories. Increases in BMI were calculated as the difference between initial BMI and that at delivery. Fisher&#146;s exact test was used to compare categorical variables and the t test between two means was used for continuous variables. Results: This study included 5,478 women: 568(10.48%) had no change in BMI category and 4.910(89.51%) increased their BMI by &gt;= 1 category. An increase in BMI category was associated with higher rates of preeclampsia (p = 0.004) and cesarean delivery(p = 0.009) in overweight women but not in women with a healthy weight at the beginning of pregnancy. Obese women had a higher risk of preeclampsia (p =0.008), gestational diabetes (p &lt; 0.001), cesarean delivery(p &lt; 0.001), and postpartum infection (p = 0.009).Conclusions: An increase in BMI category is associated with a greater risk of obstetric complications (AU)</dc:description>
