<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Analyze the treatment satisfaction and impact on patients with localized prostate cancer. METHODS One-hundred and eighty patients, with mean age of 60 years, were divided into three groups: group I--100 patients submitted to radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP), group II--40 patients who underwent radiotherapy (RT), and group III--40 healthy men. A questionnaire was applied to the groups to assess physical and psychological changes 18 months after treatment. The investigational tool was based on two questionnaires; first: SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey), second: FACT-P (Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy). RESULTS In group I, 70% never used pads, 5% presented with complete urinary incontinence, and 10% reported occasional stool leakage. In group II, 85% did not use pads and 5% reported two pads a day; 15% reported stool leakage or intestinal cramps. Sexual dysfunction was similar in both groups: 75% of the surgical group and 72.5% of the radiotherapy group reported erectile dysfunction. In the control group, 40% reported erectile dysfunction; 10% reported occasional stool leakage and none had changes regarding the overall treatment-related satisfaction. Seventy-eight percent of the RRP group and 77.5% of the RT group reported being happy respecting satisfaction with the accepted or chosen treatment, and affirmed that would choose it again. CONCLUSIONS The assessment of treatment-related satisfaction determines the treatment tolerability. This study's results did not show any significant changes in this issue between both treatment modalities (p&gt;0.05).</dc:description>
