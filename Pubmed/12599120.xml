<dc:description xml:lang="en">Few studies have been conducted on children and teenagers with borderline intelligence (BI) as a collective that shares this condition. In this paper we discuss the concept of intelligence and analyse the different cognitive profiles with which BI can be expressed. We also evaluate how aspects linked to a 'g' factor of intelligence and those linked to executive functions are involved. Among the former, how fast information is processed may play a significant role and would be related to a homogeneous BI profile. On the other hand, executive deficits would lead to BI with the passing of the years and would be linked to selective deficiencies that are related to learning disorders, language disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We highlight the need to individualise each case in order to determine the most suitable educational needs.</dc:description>
