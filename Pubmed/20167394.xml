<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the presence of anxiety in patients referred to a Nuclear Medicine Department (NMD). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 148 patients were included: 67 were referred for radioiodine therapy, 48 with hyperthyroidism (HT), 19 with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), and 81 were referred for detection and biopsy of the sentinel node in breast cancer (BC). The following documents were filled out: personal data, a state-trait anxiety inventory, a scale of pre-disposing factors causing anxiety and an information questionnaire. Anxiety-predisposing factors and the influence of the information on the presence of anxiety were studied. RESULTS HT patients: 47% had anxiety in the moment of the visit that was not related to the level of information received. The factor that worried them the most was the radioiodine administration. Being the first visit to a NMD significantly influenced (p&lt;0.05) on the presence of anxiety. DTC patients: 42% had anxiety in the moment of the visit not related to the level of information received. The factor that worried them the most was the illness itself. No factor had a significant influence on the presence of anxiety. BC patients: 53% had anxiety in the moment of the visit that was not related to the level of information received. What worried them the most were the results. Having anxiety and/or depression significantly influenced (p&lt;0.05) the presence of anxiety. CONCLUSION The quantity of information given before a procedure in a NMD does not influence on the presence of anxiety. Nevertheless, it is our duty to give the best possible information.</dc:description>
