<dc:description xml:lang="es">Objective. Clinical and epidemiological study of the nenatal sepsis in our center to know its current situation. Patients and methods. Retrospective review of cases of confirmed sepsis of vertical transmission (STV) for a period of five years (16 cases) nosocomial transmission (STN) in the last two years (85 cases). We have analyzed the incidence, epidemiology and risk factors, clinical presentation, laboratory data, empirical treatments, the sources identified and their sensitivity to common antibiotics. There was also a comparative study with a control group representative of each type of infection. The statistical descriptive and comparative study has been carried our using the program SPSS v15.0 for windows. Results.. the actual incidence of sepsis of vertical transmission in our center is 1.,25 per 1000 RM alive and nosocomial represent 1 per 50 revenue. In our study all the STV´s cases were of bacterial etiology except one for more Candida albicans, the most common germs were Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli. The STN were caused by gram-positive bacteria, followed by fungal and gram-negative. The main risk factors related to obstetric and perinatal sepsis of vertical transmission were intrapartum fever, carrying of Streptococcus, VR unknown and dyed waters, whereas the STN was associated principally with prematurity, stay in UCI and multiple pregnancy. The clinical presentation did not show differences between both types of sepsis predominant hemodynamic compromise. Regarding laboratory data analyzed they did not show significant differences relative to controls, hematocrit being the only positive finding (p=0.02). In relation to the emergence of microbial resistance, was identified K. pneumoniae in 12,8% Beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The germ most frequently isolated in our study was coagulase negative staphylococcus (COAS) by 45.3% of cases of nosocomial sepsis by Candida spp followed with 26.7%. In our series all strains of COAS were sensitive to vancomycin except one, also  identified in one case a S. aureus resistant to it. Conclusions. STV´s incidence has decreased in our center, except for nosocomial sepsis that show increase. The etiology of STV has not changed nor has appeared resistances that justify a change of treatment. STN were caused by gram-positive bacteria, followed by fungal and Gram-negative. The main risk factors were obstetric and perinatal usual and as for the laboratory data alne was significant decreases in hematocrit. We found 12,8% of Klebsiella pneumonia, 54,4&#128; of whom were carriers of ESBLs (AU)</dc:description>
