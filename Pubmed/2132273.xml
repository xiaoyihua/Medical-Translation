<dc:description xml:lang="en">A comparative, double-blind, observant, prospective and longitudinal study was performed over 27 patients treated at the maxillofacial surgery unit of the "Adolfo López Mateos" General Hospital, ISSSTE, for the purpose of evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of benzydamine oral spray in post-extraction inflammation. Patients of either sex and assorted ages were selected, with a prerequisite of no current pathology or previous history of hipersensibility. They were divided in two groups, the first one receiving a placebo, and 1.5% oral benzydamine spray applied to the second group. Each patient was instructed to apply the medication six times per day (with four sprays per application) for five days, and clinically evaluated before the study and after two and after five days of treatment. Female patients were predominant, and ages averaged 30.9 years in the benzydamine group and 28.4 years in the lot receiving placebo. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed after treatment, with superior results as to clinical course observed in the group treated with benzydamine, as compared to the placebo lot. Usefulness of benzydamine spray in the postop treatment of dental trauma (i.e., extraction of third molars), as well is its antiseptic and analgesic properties, were objectively verified in the patients.</dc:description>
