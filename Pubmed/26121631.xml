<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Bartonella henselae is the causative agent of the disease caused by cat scratches and it has a worldwide distribution. The objective of the study was to investigate its incidence in the Valencian Community during the period 2009-2012. METHODS A study of the chosen microbiological tests for B. henselae during four years was carried out. Pacients with serology (IgM and IgG), culture, or PCR positive were considered case studies. Data from the Red de Vigilancia Microbiológica Valenciana (RedMIVA) depending on the "General Direction of Public Health" (Dirección General de Salud Pública) was used as the source of information. RESULTS During the studied period, 14 cases were detected. The incidence rates were: 0,07 per 10(5) inhabitants and year of the Valencian Community, 0,10 per 10(5) inhabitants/year in the province of Alicante, with marked differences in relation to Valencia of 0,06 per 105 inhabitants/year and Castellon (with no cases). The temporal distribution of the cases were: 4 in 2009, 4 in 2010, 3 in 2011, and 3 in 2012. 64% of the cases were women and 36% men. The median age was 21 years (range 1-65 years). Predominant age groups arose between 1-10 years (42%) and 31-40 years (28%). CONCLUSIONS The incidence of B. henselae in the Valencian Community is low. The data obtained suggest that its distribution varies depending on the geographical area in the Community. There is a predominance of young people.</dc:description>
