<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective To determine the knowledge of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHIV/AIDS) towards the disease. Methods A cross-sectional study was designed for a sample of 260 persons. A validated questionnaire, developed by the authors was used; it was structured into 35 questions regarding generalities and the mode of transmission of the disease. Results A high proportion of the participants were males (59.6 %), the mean age was 35.45±10.90 years, the median time of diagnosis of the participants was 3 years. 30 % of the participants had an elementary school educational level. 3.5 % had a "good" general knowledge. Statistically significant difference was observed between "deficient" and "fair" knowledge and educational level (p&lt;0.000). 10.5 % of the females did not know that "HIV is transmitted through breast feeding", however, a statistically significant difference was observed between genders (p&lt;0.009). 67.6 % did not know the most frequent opportunistic disease of the oral cavity among PLWHIV/AIDS. No statistically significant difference (p&gt;0.05) was observed between educational level and the knowledge about questions related to CD4 cells. Statistically significant difference was observed between time of diagnosis and breast feeding as mode of transmission. Conclusion There is a need to develop educational programs geared towards PLWHIV/AIDS in order to improve their knowledge towards the disease and their quality of life.</dc:description>
