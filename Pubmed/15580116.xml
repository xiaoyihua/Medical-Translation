<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Systemic sickness can originate and proliferate alterations in the periodontium. The presence of Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) in patients suffering destructive periodontal disease and systemic illness has been widely proven. OBJECTIVE To determine the existent relation between gingivitis and ANCA in children and adolescents suffering from leukemia. These patients were examined at the Autonomous Services of the University Hospital in Maracaibo, Venezuela, and at the Hospital of Pediatrics Foundation in Zulia State, Venezuela. MATERIALS AND METHODS 40 patients ranging from 6 to 16 years of age were included in a controlled study. 20 patients suffering from acute leukemia constituted an experimental group, and 20 more patients without apparent systemic sickness who formed a control group. All 40 patients underwent clinical evaluation, and periodontal tissue radiographic evaluation and assessment of ANCA through an enzyme-linked immunoasorbent assay (ELISA); this was done using an IMMCO Diagnostic commercial kit. RESULTS No Significant differences in the gingivitis average index, plaque and bone loss between the experimental and the control group were evidenced. A significant correlation between gingivitis and ANCA was not evidenced either. Nevertheless, 7 out of 20 patients of the experimental group turned out to be ANCA positive. In contrast, no positive cases were reported in the control group. (p &lt; 0.05 Fisher Test). CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that the presence of ANCA is probably related to ongoing immune alterations in patients suffering from leukemia but not related to gingivitis.</dc:description>
