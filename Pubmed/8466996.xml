<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study of the plasma aminogram was done on 35 patients with a moderate to high level of stress and/or sepsis. For the criteria of illness, the SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiological Score) was used on their admission to the intensive Care Unit, and the diagnosis of sepsis was established according to the criteria of Jacobs and Boone. The stress level was calculated according to Bistrian. The plasma aminogram was determined with High Resolution Liquid Chromatography. The plasma samples were taken while nutrient units containing what is considered a standard solution of amino acids were infused. The eight essential amino acids (EAA) and 10 non-essential were quantified. The ratio of ramified to aromatic amino acids (RAA/AAA) was calculated by Fisher's criteria. An increase in AAA (phenylalanine, p &lt; 0.001, and tyrosine, NS) and sulphur containing amino acids (methionine, p &lt; 0.001) was found. The RAA were within normal ranges (valine) or increased (leucine, p &lt; 0.001 and isoleucine, p &lt; 0.001). The RAA/AAA ratio was reduced, p &lt; 0.0001. Glycine was increased, p &lt; 0.0001 and alanine reduced, p &lt; 0.05. Glutamine and glutamic acid were reduced, p &lt; 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.01 as was arginine, p &lt; 0.001. No difference was found in the total concentration of AA. The results confirm the standard plasma aminogram described in situations of metabolic stress and/or sepsis.</dc:description>
