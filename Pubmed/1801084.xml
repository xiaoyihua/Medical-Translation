<dc:description xml:lang="en">The conchological, anatomical and radular characteristics of Biomphalaria orbignyi are described, as well as the morphometric ratio between maximal height and maximal diameter, in which the regression coefficient value is 0.9. The life tables of Biomphalaria orbignyi shows a life range (L phi = 10.37) much higher than in the rest of the species available in Cuba; the value of k = 0.17 is similar to that of Biomphalaria havanensis. It has 2 reproductive peaks at middle age. Differently from other species of the genus, it has lower mortality at early ages and the highest peak is seen when it reaches the adult stage, which means it is a strong species. The zymograms that have been obtained confirm this species is different from B. havanensis. Since there are no marked differences on an individual basis, its correct identification requires to take into consideration every biological and ecological evidence available.</dc:description>
