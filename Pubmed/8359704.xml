<dc:description xml:lang="en">From 700 laparoscopies performed, in 600 of them (85.7%) the tuboperitoneal factor was altered. Surgery included: termino-terminal plastia 70 cases (36%), (3 patients had previous plastia); adhensiolysis 62 (31%), salpingostomy 48 (24%), neoimplantation 10 (5%), and mixed surgery 9 (4%). After surgery, desertion was present in 78 patients. Of the 121 remaining, 34 (28.1%) had primary sterility and 87 (71.9%) secondary sterility. 74 patients (61.2%) obtained pregnancy, 62 (83.8%) reached term, seven were abortions of first trimester (9.5%) and were five ectopic pregnancies (6.7%). The interval between surgery and pregnancy achievement was 1 to 48 months, 12.8 months average. We emphasize the 47 patients analysis who didn't has pregnancy, through: remark time after surgery, histerosalpingography, new laparoscopy and reevaluation of sterility factors; the results were: 19 cases (40.5%) have a 5 to 60 months time after surgery, 19.5 months average, 18 (38.3%) had new tubary obstruction, three (6.4%) with endometriosis treatment, three (6.4%) have tuberculosis genital treatment, two (4.2%) with falling again endocrine-ovarian factor, and two (4.2%) with masculine relapse. A decease was present because anesthetic complication. We underline selection surgery criterion and a strictly evaluation, such as an antiadhesion pre, trans and postoperative regime, ligamentopexya of rounds ligaments and a conscious education of the patients in their strictly pursuit.</dc:description>
