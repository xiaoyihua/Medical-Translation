The data were analyzed on Epi-Info 7 calculating frequencies, percentages, measures of central tendency and dispersion, also resorting to the use of a hypothesis test for mean difference bleeding. RESULTS There were 71 obstetric hysterectomies, 47.88% were identified by placenta accreta, increta or percreta, of which 47.05% were operated with modified technique (group 1) and 52.95% with the conventional technique (group 2). The mean ages of the groups were 31.56 in group 1 and 29.44 in group 2. Statistically the bleeding with the modified surgical technique it is less than the bleeding conventional technique. CONCLUSIONS The results serves two main purposes: to save the life of the patient and cause the least amount of side morbidity are placental problems, both the mother and the newborn, highlighting minor bleeding from a technique to another.</dc:description>
