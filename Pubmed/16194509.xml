<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To gather information on the disease characteristics and survival rate of patients diagnosed with bronchogenic carcinoma in the respiratory medicine departments of hospitals in Asturias, Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a retrospective observational study carried out using a standardized data collection protocol. All cases of lung cancer diagnosed during 2001 were included provided there was cytologic or histologic confirmation or they fulfilled a series of clinical, radiological, and/or endoscopic criteria consistent with such a diagnosis. RESULTS Standard incidence rates adjusted to the world population were 22.4, 42.6, and 4.6 per 100,000 population for the whole population, men, and women respectively. The mean (SD) age was 67 (10.9) years, and 92% of the patients were men. Overall, 98% of the men and 44% of the women were smokers. Diagnosis was confirmed by cytologic or histologic findings in 92% of patients, and the majority were non-small cell tumors (81.4%). At the time of diagnosis, 65% of the patients had advanced disease, with distant metastasis in 26.6% of the non-small cell cancers and 52.8% of the small cell cancers. Patients received surgical treatment in 21.3% of cases, chemotherapy alone or combined with radiation therapy in 43.1%, and radiation therapy alone in 9.3%. In 26.2% of patients only palliative care was given. Overall, median survival in weeks was 36.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 29.4-43.4). Median survival by treatment type was as follows: 69.3 (95% CI, 49-9.5) for surgery; 39.6 (95% CI, 31.2-48) for chemotherapy alone or with radiation therapy; 30 (95% CI, 15.4-44.6) for radiation therapy alone; and 13.3 (95% CI, 5.9-20.6) for patients who received palliative care alone (P&lt; .05). CONCLUSIONS The findings with respect to age, sex, incidence, histology, extent of tumor, and smoking status of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma in our region does not differ significantly from those reported for other areas of Spain. Current smoking is the primary cause of the high prevalence of this disease. Twenty-six percent of patients received only palliative care. The percentage of patients treated with surgery was low.</dc:description>
