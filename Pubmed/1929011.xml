<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this paper an attempt is made to analyze the variations in the incidence and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in our environment. A review has been made of the clinical records of premature infants with a diagnosis of BPD from 1979 to 1989, both inclusive. The existence of BPD was accepted when, after assisted ventilation with intermittent positive pressure for a minimum of 72 hours, there were respiratory difficulties, a compatible radiography of the thorax and requirements of over 0.21 FiO2 on the 28th day of life. Between 1985 and 1989, the incidence of BPD was similar to that of the five previous years (38.3% versus 42.3%), but mortality decreased (21.7% versus 36.3%). Other epidemiological data worth noting are the appearance of BPD in 2.6 per 1000 live newborns, 9.6 per 1000 newborns kept in hospital and 15.9% of premature infants treated with ventilation. BPD was found in 73% of newborns weighing less than 1.000 g, 41% weighing between 1000 and 1.499 g and only 16% of those weighing over 1,499 g. BPD was found in all newborns of less than 28 weeks, in 38% of those between 28 and 30 weeks and only in 4% of those aged more than 30 weeks. BPD appeared specially after hyalline membrane disease (30.7%).</dc:description>
