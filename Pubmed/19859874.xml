<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND AIMS Although antiepileptic drugs are usually administered orally, sometimes they must be given intravenously. Levetiracetam is the only one of the new antiepileptic drugs that can be administered intravenously. In this study we report on the use of intravenous levetiracetam in a general hospital, while also evaluating its effectiveness and safety. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted of the medical records of all hospital admissions that were treated with intravenous levetiracetam between July 2007 and May 2008. RESULTS A total of 53 patients were treated with intravenous levetiracetam. Approximately half the patients (47%) had been admitted to neurology, followed by neurosurgery (21%) and oncology (9%). The mean age was 52.2 years (range: 9-87 years) and 40% were females. Seizures were symptomatic in 81% of cases and the most common aetiologies were strokes (40%) and brain tumours (33%). The most frequent presenting symptoms were repeated epileptic seizures (47.2%) and epileptic status (26.4%). Overall, control of seizures was achieved in 87% of patients. No severe side-effects that could be attributed to levetiracetam therapy were detected. CONCLUSIONS Intravenous levetiracetam seems to be an effective, safe antiepileptic drug in hospitalised patients, and especially so in those who present an associated comorbidity and/or who are on multiple drug therapy.</dc:description>
