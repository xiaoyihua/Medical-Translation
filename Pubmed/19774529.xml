<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Decompressive craniectomy increases the survival rate in cases of malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. The imaging and clinical signs that predict a malignant progression of stroke of the MCA are analysed, together with factors associated with a poorer prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study involved 30 patients, who were divided into three groups: patients who had undergone surgery, and patients who had not undergone surgery but were admitted to intensive care or to neurology wards. The surgical procedure consisted in creating a bone window with a diameter of at least 10 cm and a dural opening. The initial evaluation of the patient was performed using the Glasgow scale and the National Institute of Health stroke scale; follow-up was carried out using the modified Rankin scale, the Barthel index and the Glasgow Outcome Scale at six months. RESULTS Younger patients have a better functional prognosis than those over 60 years of age. A deviation of more than 10 mm from the mean line is associated with a poorer prognosis, as are volumes of infarcted tissue above 350 cm3. Lower scores on the Glasgow scale on admission are associated with a poorer prognosis for survival and a higher number of sequelae, as well as their reduction during hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS Age conditions the presence of sequelae in these patients. The presence of clinical signs of herniation (anisocoria, lower initial score or important drop on the Glasgow scale) and imaging signs (displacement of the mean line, volume of infarcted tissue) imply a poorer prognosis. Early surgery in those patients in whom it is indicated reduces the number of sequelae and increases the rate of survival.</dc:description>
