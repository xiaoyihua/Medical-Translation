<dc:description xml:lang="en">In a prospective study carried out in the Hospital de Gineco-Obstetricia, Centro Médico León, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, 200 women with pregnancies 32-41 weeks, without risk factors, were included in order to evaluate the perinatal outcome in patients with decreased fetal movement. The sample was divided in two groups: 100 patients with decreased fetal movement (study group) and 100 patients with normal fetal movement (control group). The group of patients with decreased fetal movement had higher incidence of complications during delivery (only 35% had normal delivery), greater average of birth weight (3,412 g), more cases of meconium stained fluid (26%) and higher frequency of placental calcifications (29%) as compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.01). In comparing newborn Apgar score and perinatal morbidity and mortality rates there were no statistical difference in both groups. It's concluded that antepartum fetal surveillance has a definite role in diminishing the morbidity and mortality rates in patients with decreased fetal movement.</dc:description>
