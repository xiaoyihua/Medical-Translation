<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM ABO-hemolytic disease occurs when ABO-incompatibility is present between the mother and the fetus. The objective of the present study was to analyze ABO-hemolytic disease in our center, to compare two serologic tests to diagnose it and to evaluate hematocrit values in cord blood samples. METHODS ABO and Rh(D) group was found in 881 blood samples. Umbilical cord blood samples were obtained and direct antiglobulin test (DAT), eluate and microhematocrit were performed. RESULTS ABO-incompatibility was found in 134 (15.3%) cases. DAT was positive in 31.6% of patients studied with ABO-incompatibility and the eluate identified the antibody in 68.4% of studied patients (p = 0.001). Hematocrit values were lower in the group with ABO-incompatibility than in the ABO-compatible group (44 +/- 7.8% vs. 46.5 +/- 6.5%; p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS Although severe ABO hemolytic disease is rare, ABO incompatibility is detected with current serologic tests and it causes a certain degree of hemolysis in newborn infants.</dc:description>
