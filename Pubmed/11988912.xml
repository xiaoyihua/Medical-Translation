<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Disseminated acute encephalomyelitis (DAE) is an autoimmune inflammatory condition, usually monophasic with gradual resolution, polysymptomatic, usually in relation to a virus, bacteria or immunizations but may also occur in the absence of any obvious infection. OBJECTIVE To describe DAE, its aetiology, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment. Also to analyze these aspects with regard to a series of 13 children with DAE. RESULTS The clinical condition started with fever in 61% of the patients. The commonest neurological findings were sensory deterioration, convulsions and motor disorders (paresias). The cerebrospinal fluid was abnormal in four patients. MR showed hyperintense lesions of multifocal distribution, predominantly in the subcortical white matter. All patients were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 20 30 mg/kg. Clinical follow up showed complete recovery in 11/13 patients and mild sequelae in two cases. CONCLUSIONS Diagnosis of DAE is based on suggestive clinical data and MR findings. MR is very sensitive in detecting demyelinating lesions and is the method of choice for confirmation of the diagnosis. DAE is characterized by a satisfactory clinical course with simultaneous resolution of the demyelinating lesions.</dc:description>
