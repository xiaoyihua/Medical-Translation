<dc:description xml:lang="en">DSM-IV defines Borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a personality disorder that can be primarily characterized by emotional instability, extremely polarized thought and chaotic interpersonal relations. It is the most common personality disorder. Its prevalence is estimated to be from 0.2% to 1.8% of the general population, and the 76% of them are women. However, despite these data and the different biologic findings, there are few publications on neuroimage about this nosologic entity. Recent studies suggest that a dual cerebral disorder, including frontal and limbic circuits, could be present in characterize BPD. These cerebral areas would also be involved in the serotonergic dysfunction that seems to be related to the impulse dyscontrol and self-aggressive behaviour, characteristic of these patients. Most authors point out the importance of traumatic precedents in the BPD genesis, with a direct relation between stress and the neurobiological findings observed, including the neuroimage changes. The aim of this article is to make a revision of the main neuroimage data found in BPD, including the new techniques such as functional MRI, diffusion tensor MRI and spectroscopy.</dc:description>
