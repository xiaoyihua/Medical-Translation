<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE We compared the safety and efficacy of liposomal amphotericin B with other formulations of amphotericin B and voriconazol as an empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. MATERIAL AND METHOD Several randomized controlled clinical trials, designed to evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of liposomal amphotericin B in the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia, in comparison with other amphotericin B formulations or voriconazol, were identified by means of a search in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register's data bases. American Society of Microbiology and American Society of Clinical Oncology abstracts, presented between 1999 and 2002, were also included in the search. Prior to data extraction, concepts like nephrotoxicity, infusion-related adverse events and efficacy (success rate and mortality) were defined. RESULTS Two studies comparing liposomal amphotericin B with conventional amphotericin B, one comparing liposomal amphotericin B with amphotericin B lipid complex and one comparing liposomal amphotericin B with voriconazol were included in the analysis. Patients treated with liposomal amphotericin B had lower nephrotoxicity than patients treated with other amphotericin B formulations or with conventional amphotericin B (RR = 0.49); conversely, no statistically significant differences with regard to voriconazol were observed. In terms of efficacy, mortality rate and therapeutic failure, patients treated with limposomal amphotericin B showed a slightly higher efficacy. CONCLUSIONS Liposomal amphotericin B is a lipidic formulation with a slightly higher efficacy than other amphotericin B formulations and voriconazol. In terms of nephrotoxicity, liposomal amphotericin B showed lower nephrotoxicity than other amphotericines while its safety rates were similar to those of voriconazol.</dc:description>
