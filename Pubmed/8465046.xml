<dc:description xml:lang="en">A propos of a case of intestinal infection due to Salmonella non typhi in a patient with ulcerative colitis, we have reviewed the disease and, therefore ran a search through the scientific literature in which we have found 16 cases of ulcerative colitis diagnosed in a clinical setting which began as an enterocolitis due to Salmonella. Bacteriological studies, clinical evolution and response to treatment, normally allow to differentiate between the two clinical entities. Colitis due to Salmonella and ulcerative colitis can coexist in the same patient. Duration of the clinical manifestations oven four weeks, previous history of diarrhea with blood, the sudden worsening of a mild prolonged diarrhea, non-response to specific antibiotic treatment and fast response to therapy with corticoids of a diarrhea positive isolation of Salmonella in stools, should make us immediately think in the coexistence of a subjacent ulcerative colitis. Treatment with steroids always must be associated with systemic antibiotics if Salmonella has been isolated just before or during their administration.</dc:description>
