<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report the case of a 52-year-old woman who underwent scheduled laparoscopic resection of a hydatid liver cyst under general anesthesia by infusion of remifentanil and sevoflurane. Surgery was uneventful, although invasive monitoring was required, just as it would have been in major open abdominal surgery, given the risk of bleeding secondary to organ manipulation, the risk of anaphylactic shock related to the etiology of the cyst and the possibility of gas embolism related to laparoscopy. The concept of "minimally invasive" surgery has developed thanks to continued progress in laparoscopy. The considerable advantages of such procedures in comparison with "open" or "conventional" surgery has led to their use with organs such as the liver, which in principle require caution. In such cases, the anesthesiologist must take an approach that is not as simple or minimalist as the term "minimally invasive" might lead us to expect.</dc:description>
