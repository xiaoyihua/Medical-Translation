<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of early or late clamping of the umbilical cord in term newborns, assessing the levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin, and their correlation with some of the complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective study of healthy newborns at term or born by dystotic or eutocic delivery in our hospital between May 2009 until May 2010. Patients were assigned according to the time of clamping, group 1 (&lt;60 seconds), group 2 (1 to&lt;2 minutes), and group 3 (2 to 3 minutes). Laboratory tests were performed at birth and at 48 hours of life, assessing the levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, ferritin, and bilirubin. The risk of polycythemia, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal phototherapy or admission to the Intensive Care Unit and the hospital stay, were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 242 patients were included: group 1 (g1=80), group 2 (g2=31) y group 3 (g3=131). The background maternal and neonatal characteristics were similar in all sets. The first test showed significant differences in ferritin levels in those infants with delayed clamping (g1: 111 mg/dl, g2: 125 mg/dl, g3: 173 mg/dl; p&lt;0.01). In the second analysis the values of hemoglobin (g1: 17.3 g/dl, g2: 18.9 g/dl, g3: 19.2 g/dl; p&lt;0.01), hematocrit (g1: 53.4%, g2: 58%, g3: 59%; p&lt;0.01) and ferritin (g1: 254 mg/dl, g2: 254.7 mg/dl, g3: 313 mg/dl; p = 0.008) were statistically higher in this group. As regards complications, a significant increase was observed in the number of cases of polycythemia symptoms in group 3. CONCLUSIONS The late cord clamping is associated with an increase in hematocrit, hemoglobin and ferritin at 48 hours of life, as well as an increased risk of polycythemia present with symptoms.</dc:description>
