<dc:description xml:lang="en">Differentiating between pressure ulcers and moisture related lesions is of clinical importance since prevention and treatment strategies differ greatly and the consequences of the outcome for the patient are important. In this article, we describe a case involving a 65 years old woman who had moisture lesions. Wound related characteristics (location, causes, shape, edges, depth, colour and necrosis), along with patient related characteristics, are helpful to differentiate between a pressure ulcer and a moisture lesion. Clinically, separate identification of moisture lesions makes sense, because they do not follow the same pattern as pressure ulcers. For example, these lesions are not found over a bony prominence (occurring in areas of low pressure), with blanchable erythema, and there is no necrosis. For these reasons we believe that these wounds are more likely to be moisture lesions. A nursing care plan was then developed, which includes objectives and nursing intervention implementation. The effects of moisture on the skin should be taken into consideration as these can lead in a higher risk of lesions. Therefore, it is vital that healthcare professionals have an up to date knowledge of both moisture lesions and pressure ulcers, and are able to use the appropriate assessment tools and skin care regimes in order to prevent a bad situation from becoming worse.</dc:description>
