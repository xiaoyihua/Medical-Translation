<dc:description xml:lang="en">This report describes the results of human enterovirus (HEV) detection and characterization using cell culture, polymerase chain reaction and molecular typing in 2167 samples obtained from acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis and acute encephalitis patients, from 1991 to 1998 in Argentina. HEV were isolated in 130 out of 666 cases (19.5%) and 36 out of 666 (5.4%). HEV RNA was detected in 28.8% (231/801) and 3.0% (21/700) of the patients with meningitis and encephalitis, respectively. Children with ages ranging from 1 to 9 years accounted for 75.3% of the meningitis cases and from 1 to 4 years for 58% of acute flaccid paralysis patients. Echovirus 4 (E4), E9, E30 and E17 were identified from meningitis outbreaks. Coxsackievirus A2 (CAV2), CBV2, CBV5, E7, E11, E19, E24, E29 and enterovirus 71 were recovered only from sporadic cases. Three different serotypes were identified in encephalitis patients: E4, E7 and E24. A total of 28 different serotypes of non-polio enteroviruses were detected from acute flaccid paralysis cases. The information here presented contributes to improving our knowledge about enteroviruses epidemiology in Argentina and their relationship with different neurological diseases. This study provides valuable data that could be useful to further research.</dc:description>
