<dc:description xml:lang="en">Fifty cases with pyelonephritis were found among 1314 histopathologic studies performed at Children's Hospital of Cordoba, Argentine from 1967 to 1976. Twenty-six had urologic abnormalities. Most of them were males over two years old. Eleven had unilateral pyelonephritis. Twenty-four had clinical and pathological signs of septicemia or infection. No sex difference was found and most of them were infants under two years of age. All patients had bilateral pyelonephritis. Twenty-four patients showed positive urine culture before death. They also showed clinical features, urinary concentration inability and pyelographic changes that suggest pyelonephritis. Our conclusions are that pyelonephritis is not common among children, and appeares only associated with systemic infection or urologic abnormalities. Clinical signs, urinary examination and intravenous pyelography are useful in the diagnosis of pyelonephritis.</dc:description>
