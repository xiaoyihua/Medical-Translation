<dc:description xml:lang="en">In a workforce of 8,149 workers, we reviewed the sick leave certificates issued over a period of 1 year. Amongst the absenteeism resulting from common diseases, 9.28% were of rheumatic nature (the second cause being respiratory viral infections). Furthermore, these rheumatic complaints were responsible for 14.66% days absenteeism from work, with a mean duration of 38.17 days, which was longer than for any of the other causes. In respect of accidents in the work place, 16.17% were influenced by rheumatic problems. These resulted in 18.77% days absenteeism with a mean duration of 33.94 days, which was greater than that relating to all other accidents. The total cost was close to 1.600 million pesetas.</dc:description>
