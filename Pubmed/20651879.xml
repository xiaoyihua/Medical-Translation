<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cell replenishment is critical for adult tissue repair after damage. In some organs this process is facilitated by stem cells. In contrast to the liver, the kidney has limited regeneration capacity and has even been considered over several years as not being able to regenerate itself. Nevertheless, there are several recent studies suggesting the presence of stem cells in the adult kidney. Stem cell renal niches have been identified in the renal papillae in animals as well as in the urinary pole of the Bowman's capsule in humans (CD24+CD133+ stem cells). Although these cells may contribute to organ regeneration, how these cells exert this effect and their role after kidney injury is not known. Nevertheless, renal stem cells may be therapeutic targets for treatment of renal diseases. On the other hand, bone-marrow-derived stem cells may also contribute to renal repair, particularly mesenchymal stem cells. However, the mechanism for producing such effect has not been elucidated. Some studies suggest there is cell fusion between bone marrow and resident tubular cells; others suggest that bone marrow cells are able to differentiate in resident cells, while some authors propose bone marrow cells facilitate organ regeneration by a paracrine action; that is by secreting growth factors such as HGF, VEGF and IGF1. All these secreted molecules would provide a regenerative milieu able to constrain renal damage and to amplify stem cells migration to the damaged organ.</dc:description>
