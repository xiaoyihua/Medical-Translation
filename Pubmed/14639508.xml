<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The assessment of the needs for care for long term severe ill patients has been one of the areas of greatest interest since the community mental health system was established. OBJECTIVE This study has aimed to describe the needs for care of a group of schizophrenic patients and to know if these needs are met by the public mental health network. METHODS A cohort of 83 schizophrenic patients was selected. The diagnosis was confirmed by the SCAN method. The Needs for Care Assessment instrument was used to assess the needs for care of the patients. RESULTS The positive psychotic symptoms (98%) followed by slowness and underactivity (71%) are the most common clinical problems between the patients of the cohort. In regards to skills and abilities, the most common are those related with work (49%) and house keeping (domestic work, getting meal and domestic shopping, with 42, 41 and 41%, respectively). In regards to the state of the need, 81% of the clinical problems are covered while this is only 40% in the social area. CONCLUSIONS The clinical needs of the schizophrenic patients can be met by the mental health services established, oriented to the community care. However, attending social needs requires more rehabilitation, occupational and residential resources to be developed.</dc:description>
