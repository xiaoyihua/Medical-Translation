<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To estimate the frequency of H. pylori clinical isolates resistant to six commonly used antimicrobials. DESIGN Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING A tertiary-referral health care institution in Mexico City. PARTICIPANTS 31 isolates of H. pylori from 31 patients with chronic antral gastritis were obtained from gastric mucosal biopsy specimens. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) to ampicillin, amoxycillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole and to colloidal bismuth subcitrate was determined by the agar plate dilution test. RESULTS All isolates showed to be susceptible to the former four antibiotics but only in 46% and 55% growth was inhibited by 8 micrograms/mL and 16 micrograms/mL of metronidazole, respectively. All isolates were inhibited by &lt; or = 128 micrograms/mL of bismuth. A 50% increase in the percentage of metronidazole-resistant isolates (MIC &gt; or = 8 micrograms/mL) between 1988 to 1992 was observed. CONCLUSION There is a need of future studies in our setting aimed at assessing the cost/effectiveness of diverse H. pylori-associated peptic ulcer treatment options.</dc:description>
