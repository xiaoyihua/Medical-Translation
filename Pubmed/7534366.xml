<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The indication for treatment with human gammaglobulin in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia is well established. Nonetheless, there are no uniform criteria with regard to dose, periodicity and route of administration. METHODS Twenty-seven patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVI) who received i.m. or i.v. treatment with gammaglobulin were studied, evaluating the secondary effects, stable levels of IgG achieved, control of symptomatology, clinical evolution and the need for adjuvant therapies. RESULTS Intravenous administration was more effective than intramuscular administration to achieve higher total IgG serum levels (5.2 +/- 1.2 vs 3.5 +/- 1.6 g/l; p = 0.07) in a shorter period of time (2.1 +/- 1.6 months vs 6.3 +/- 2.8 months; p &lt; 0.01) and with new few secondary effects. The dose and periodicity of the treatment was individualized in each patient on the basis of the needs of consumption and the speed of metabolism of the gammaglobulin, with patients with chronic bronchial suppuration and diarrhea being those requiring the greatest doses (p &lt; 0.0001) and a short interdosis time interval (19.2 +/- 3.1 vs 23.6 +/- 3.6 days; p = 0.01). Treatment with human gammaglobulin allowed the control of recurrent bacterial infection; however, adjuvant treatment with respiratory physical measures and antibiotics were required in patients with chronic bronchial suppuration to avoid progressive alteration of respiratory function. CONCLUSIONS The administration of human gammaglobulin at adequate doses and frequency is effective to control infection, avoid the development of chronic bronchial disease, alteration of pulmonary function and the appearance of other complications. Intravenous route is safer and produces fewer secondary effects than intramuscular administration with the doses and period of the treatment requiring individualization for each patient.</dc:description>
