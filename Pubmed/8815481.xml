<dc:description xml:lang="en">A randomized clinical trial was performed in children with cancer, fever and neutropenia, to evaluate the efficacy of amikacin once daily versus thrice daily dosing plus carbenicillin in both groups. Fifty patients were included, 25 patients in group A who received amikacin once daily and 25 in group B who received amikacin thrice daily. No intergroup differences were observed, i.e., fever diminished in a median of 6 days (2-8 days) vs. 7 days (3-12 days) in groups A and B respectively (p = 0.37);clinical improvement was observed in a median of 6 days (3-10 days) vs 7 days (2-14 days) (p = 0.68). One patient in group A and two in B died. The peak levels of amikacin on the 7th day of treatment were 10-60 and 7-25 micrograms/mL in groups A and B respectively, and the serum creatinine levels were 0.3 - 0.7 for group A and 0.2 - 0.8 mg/dL for group B; none of the patients presented a creatinine above 40% of the basal value. Three patients of group A had amikacin levels higher than 40 micrograms/mL without increasing the creatinine levels; our observations do not suggest that toxicity is higher. We conclude that the administration of aminoglycoside once daily seems to be as effective as the traditional dosing.</dc:description>
