<dc:description xml:lang="en">A revision of all the clinical histories of asthmatic children discharged from our hospital in the period from January 1st until December 31st 1972, is performed. Sex, age and number of hospitalizations are taken into consideration. A total of 650 clinical histories comprised all the parameters established to alizing 1002 admissions. An incidence of 6,9% of all admissions corresponded to asthmatic children being the age group 0 - 4 the most frequently involved, with a total of 490 patients corresponding to 75% of all patients studied. The age group 0 - 4 comprised 763 of the 1002 admissions, corresponding to 76% of all admissions. A male predominance was found corresponding to 50% of all patients. The older age groups presented less incidence of admissions; this may be to a tendency towards less acute symptoms as the children grow older; the homeostatic mechanisms of the child are more mature; a small percentage refused to be hospitalized. The age groups 0 - 4, are considered of high risk, due to severity of symptoms this age group usually presents at the moment of hospitalization. During 1973, a total of 73 defunctions due to asthma bronchitis and emphysema were recorded in children less than 15 years old, out of which 85% corresponded to the age group 0 -4.</dc:description>
