<dc:description xml:lang="en">Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently reported agent of acute infection in the respiratory tract. It has been found in children as well as in young adults and elders. The clinical manifestations produced by hMPV are indistinguishable from those by common respiratory virus, and can evolve from asymptomatic infection into severe pneumonia. On the other hand, some authors have described cases of bronchial asthma exacerbation associated with hMPV infection. In this work we report a case of a child who presented a severe bronchial asthmatic crisis with a suspected viral associated infection. Immunofluorescence tests yielded negative results for sincitial respiratory virus, adenovirus, a-b influenza virus and parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, virus. In an attempt to detect the presence of hMPV, a RT-PCR was carried out to amplify sequences from both N and F genes. Using this approach, a positive result for hMPV was obtained. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a case of asthma exacerbation associated to hMPV in our region. In addition, these results are similar to previous reports where it was hypothesized that, like RSV, hMPV can trigger a respiratory chronic disease as asthma.</dc:description>
