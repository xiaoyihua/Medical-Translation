<dc:description xml:lang="en">The development of the Internet is continuous and appears to be never-ending, although with the arrival of Web 3.0 it could be said that the Internet is what its creators intended it to be from the first moment, an extraordinary and immense organised, understandable, and easy to access data base, characteristics still not achieved. The innovations and services included in Web 3.0 will result, in the first place, in better, faster and safer access to quality information. In the second place it should provide better personalisation of the health services that Internet users access, avoiding irrelevant information that may contain wrong, false and dangerous recommendations. However, these changes will have to be accompanied by the legal requirements common to the information society, by the ethical aspects associated with medical care, guaranteeing and contributing, in all cases, to improving the doctor-patient relationship.</dc:description>
