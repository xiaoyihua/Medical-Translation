<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS The objective of the study was to know the clinical and epidemiological features, including associated psychiatric morbidity, of the children seeking help for enuresis in a public child and adolescent mental health unit. SUBJECTS AND METHOD Within an exploratory, retrospective, and observational study, we reviewed the clinical charts of all the children (N= 2,315) attending the unit during a five-year period (January 1992-December 1997), collecting information on gender, age, type of enuresis, associated psychiatric morbidity, and social and family characteristics. Both the enuresis and the associated psychiatric disorders were diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria. RESULTS Enuresis was the reason for admission in 230 children (9.9%), whose mean (+/- SD) age was 9.0 (+/- 2.9) years (range: 5-18). The condition of single-parent family, the perception of economic difficulties, and a poor academic achievement were not associated to any type of enuresis. A 19.5 per cent of the patients with enuresis presented a co-morbid psychiatric disorder, which was significantly associated to both male gender in subjects younger than 9 and enuresis of the type secondary or mixed. DISCUSSION Most children with enuresis referred for psychiatric consultation do not present an associated psychiatric disorder. Our results on children with enuresis, in a clinical sample, are similar to those of previous studies conducted in the general population. This may mean that these patients are sent to child psychiatry services for reasons of traditional health delivery uses rather than for their psychopathological characteristics.</dc:description>
