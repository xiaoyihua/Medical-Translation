<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate changes in physical performance in institutionalized older adults through a program of physiotherapy exercises. MATERIALS AND METHODS A quasi-experimental study was conducted on adults over 60 years-old, institutionalized in Lima, Peru. The exercise program was implemented in 45minutes sessions included warming-up, muscle strengthening exercises, balance, gait training and cooling phase, three times a week for 12 weeks. Physical performance was measured with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) one week before and after the intervention. It included 45 participants, of whom 16 did not attend any of the sessions and was used as a control group. RESULTS The mean age was 77.6±7.1 years, and 62.2% were women. The mean baseline SPPB was 7.0±1.6 in the intervention group, and 6.9±1.9 in the control group (P=.90). A change of 2.6±1.8 was observed in the SPPB of the intervention group versus -1.4±2.0 in the control group (P&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS The development of a physiotherapy exercise program for institutionalized elderly increases physical performance, which could be implemented in care centers for elderly.</dc:description>
