<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The present state of minimally invasive surgery in gastric cancer is reviewed and its technical aspects are detailed. PATIENTS AND METHOD The authors provide their personal experience in a non-randomized prospective study, in two different settings (the CHU Charleroi, Belgium and the Hospital of Zumárraga, the Basque Country, Spain) carried out between June 1993 and January 2004. In this study involving 101 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, the mini-invasive laparoscopic approach was employed as a surgical tool with the "aim of treatment by laparoscopy". The average age of the patients was 67 years (37-83). RESULTS Postoperativemortality after 60 days was 5 patients; 87 patients were subjected to an oncological follow-up averaging 41 months (7-129). The average of survival observed in the 10 non-resected patients was 4.5 months. The average of survival observed in the 10 patients subjected to a palliative resection was 7.1 months. The actuarial survival after 5 years observed following type RO exeresis was 34%. The 5-years actuarial survival of the resected patients was 29%. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic gastrectomy associated with any type of lymphadenectomy is a significant but safe intervention, with acceptable rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced gastric cancer, who frequently present a bad general status. The long term oncological results are similar to those obtained via laparotomy. More prospective studies are needed that evaluate the results of this approach, both its short-term benefits and the long range oncological result.</dc:description>
