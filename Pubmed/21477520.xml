<dc:description xml:lang="en">Nowadays surgery cannot be conceived as independent from medicine; consequently, surgical education cannot be far from the main principles of medical education. This review underlines the characteristics of medical training in the field of surgery. General physicians should be trained to perform surgical procedures under particular situations. A new lesson plan was implemented at the Facultad de Medicina in Mexico City (UNAM), comprised of eight fundamental surgical skills. A well-structured surgical program implies clear and exact definitions of the skills to be acquired during training as well as an appropriate follow-up, knowledge reinforcement, continuing educational skills, application of medical tests for patient care and evaluation of the learning process.</dc:description>
