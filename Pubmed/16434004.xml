<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Chagas disease is the most common cause of myocarditis in Latin America, including Venezuela. Some 25% of patients progress to chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by heart failure and arrhythmias. The serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) have prognostic value in non-chagasic cardiopathy. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between the serum levels of CRP and IL-6 and the developmental stage of Chagas disease. PATIENTS AND METHOD The study included 64 Chagas disease patients (34 female and 30 male; age 62.2 [1.7] years) and 20 healthy individuals (10 of each sex; age 50.4 [2.7] years). Clinical investigations included echocardiography and measurement of CRP and IL-6 serum levels using ELISAs. Chagas disease patients were graded according to Carrasco et al 1994 classification. Patients with ischemic cardiopathy, liver disease, autoimmune disease, a systemic inflammatory condition, immunosuppression, cancer, pericarditis, or endocarditis were excluded. RESULTS Multiple regression analysis demonstrated an association between Chagas disease developmental stage and the serum IL-6 level. The serum CRP level increased during only the most advanced phase of the disease. In addition, a high left ventricular mass index was associated with a high IL-6 level and male sex. CONCLUSIONS IL-6 and CRP serum levels could be of prognostic value in assessing Chagas disease progression because there are significant correlations between elevated levels and the deterioration of cardiac function.</dc:description>
