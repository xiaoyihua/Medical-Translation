<dc:description xml:lang="en">The possible relation between the amount and composition of fat in the diet of different regions and provinces in Spain and the mortality caused by different types of cancer is studied. The quantitative information about fat intake comes from a publication entitled "Nutrition Study" (1985) which was performed by our Nutrition Department together with the National Institute of Statistics (INE). The study sample is formed by 23,972 families and is representative of the whole country and of each of the Provinces and Autonomic Communities in it. Each family is surveyed for seven days for the "Family Direct Survey". The dietetic parameters studied have been the following: total energy intake, total lipids, total fat and fatty acids as a percentage of total caloric intake, cooking fat/total fat ratio, vegetable fat, animal fat, fish fat, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and cholesterol. These parameters have been correlated with mortality date due to the following tumors: malignant tumors in general, breast, uterine neck, uterus, ovary, prostate, and testicle, in each of the provinces in our country, expressed per 100,000 inhabitants, data which was obtained from the INE publication (1986). Similarly, the corresponding correlations have been carried out between dietetic parameters and breast cancer adjusted mortality rate. From our study we can conclude that there is a statistically significant negative correlation between mortality due to testicle cancer and some dietetic parameters. However, breast, prostate, and ovary neoplasias are only affected by certain parameters. These results agree with those obtained by other authors. No statisticaly significant correlation is found when adjusted rates are used.</dc:description>
