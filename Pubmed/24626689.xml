<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of application of prevention and control measures for type 2 diabetes in Mexican population. MATERIALS AND METHODS ENSANUT 2012 is a nationally and by-state representative survey. Sample design was probabilistic, multistage, stratified and clustered. The information of 46 277 adults≥20 was used for this analysis. A weighted analysis was performed using Stata 12. RESULTS Prevalence of diabetes by previous diagnosis was 9.2% (6.4 millions) in ENSANUT 2012, 7.3% (3.7 millions) in 2006 and 4.6% (2.1 millions) in 2000. In 2012, the mean of medical examinations in the previous year related to diabetes control was 7.3. However, the percentage of cases in which preventive actions for chronic complications were performed (such as foot care [14.6%], ophthalmology [8.6%] and determination of HbA1c [9.6%]) was low. CONCLUSIONS Patients with diabetes have frequent access to medical services. However, preventive actions are applied insufficiently both in quality and quantity.</dc:description>
