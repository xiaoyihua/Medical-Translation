<dc:description xml:lang="en">The new public health surveillance requires at the global, national and local levels the use of new authoritative analytical approaches and tools for better recognition of the epidemiologic characteristics of the priority health events and risk factors affecting the population health. The identification of the events in time and space is of fundamental importance so that the geo-spatial description of the situation of diseases and health events facilitates the identification of social, environmental and health care related risks. This assessment examines the application and use of geo-spatial tools for identifying relevant spatial and epidemiological conglomerates of malaria in Chiapas, Mexico. The study design was ecological and the level of aggregation of the collected information of the epidemiological and spatial variables was municipalities. The data were collected in all municipalities of the state of Chiapas, Mexico during the years 2000-2002. The main outcome variable was cases and types of malaria diagnosed by blood smears in weekly reports. Independent variables were age, sex, ethnicity, literacy of the cases of malaria and environmental factors such as altitude, road type and network in the municipalities and cities of Chiapas. The production of thematic maps and the application of geo-spatial analytical tools such Moran and local indicator of spatial autocorrelation metrics for malaria clustering allowed the visualization and recognition that the important population risk factors associated with high malaria incidence in Chiapas were low literacy rate, areas with high percentage of indigenous population that reflects the social inequalities gaps in health and the great burden of disease that is affecting this important vulnerable group in Chiapas. The presence of road networks allowed greater spatial diffusion of Malaria. An important epidemiological and spatial cluster of malaria was identified in the areas and populations in the proximity of the southern border. The use of geospatial metrics in local areas will assist in the epidemiological stratification of malaria for better targeting more effective and equitable prevention and control interventions.</dc:description>
