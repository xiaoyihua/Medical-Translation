<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To find the evolution of the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs among adolescents in an urban area. DESIGN Descriptive, cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire. SETTING Secondary school (middle-class urban area). PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS Six hundred and seventy-eight students took part in the years 1997, 2001, and 2004. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The questionnaire included questions on age, sex and consumption of toxic substances. The following figures are given in order of the year of study. We studied 172, 249, and 257 adolescents, with a mean age of 14 (interval, 12-17) and equality of sexes. The proportion of adolescents with no consumption of toxic substances increased (21%+/-3.1%; 34%+/-3.0% 56%+/-3.1%; P&lt;.001, chi2), basically because alcohol consumption dropped (58%+/-3.6%; 61%+/-3.2%; 41%+/-3.1%; P&lt;.001, chi2), although its weekend consumption increased (84%+/-2.6%; 85%+/-2.2%; 96%+/-1.2%; P&lt;.05, chi2), especially of spirits. Tobacco consumption increased (12%+/-2.4%; 21%+/-2.3%; 29%+/-2.4%; P&lt;.001, chi2) with a pattern of daily smoking (9%+/-0.6%; 34%+/-3.2%; 47%+/-3.1%; P&lt;.01, chi2). The consumption of illegal rugs also increased (9%+/-0.6%; 24%+/-2.8%; 16%+/-2.4%; P&lt;.001, chi2), with an intermittent pattern of consumption (87%+/-1.6%; 71%+/-2.3%; 85%+/-1.8). Cannabis is the most used drug (&gt;90%), cocaine use fell and design drug use increased. Age affected consumption, but sex did not. CONCLUSIONS In the last 8 years the consumption of toxic substances among adolescents has dropped, mainly because of less alcohol consumption. However, new forms of consumption of alcohol and other illegal drugs, especially at weekends, emerged and daily consumption of tobacco increased.</dc:description>
