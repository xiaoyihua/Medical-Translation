<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Troponin-I (TnI) is a marker of severe pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in unselected patients. There are few articles that assess its usefulness in hemodynamically-stable patients. OBJECTIVES To assess the correlation between TnI levels and both echocardiographic/radiologic signs of right ventricle (RV) dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension (PH), and the severity of the pulmonary vascular obstruction. METHODS We selected patients from a prospective cohort of 103 consecutive patients with PTE and systolic arterial pressure ≥ 90 mmHg. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and echocardiography were performed in all patients. We performed a post hoc study, analyzing the 68 cases in which TnI was measured, at the discretion of the emergency room physician. RESULTS Patients included had a median age of 74 years and 50% were male. The patients with elevated TnI had a differentiated clinical profile, suggestive of more severe PTE. There was a significant correlation between TnI levels and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (r=0.46, P&lt;.001), the CTPA-measured pulmonary artery diameter (r=0.48, P&lt;.001), the CTPA-measured RV diameter (r=0.47, P=.001) and the pulmonary vascular obstruction index (r=0.39, P=.001). CONCLUSION The higher levels of TnI in patients with hemodynamically stable PTE predicts the existence of more severe PE in hemodynamically-stable patients. This biomarker could be used in the clinical practice to select those patients who might require more intensive monitoring or additional complementary studies.</dc:description>
