<dc:description xml:lang="en">Carnitine is present in seminal fluid either as a free compound or in acetylated form, and as can be inferred from the latest studies, it is of epididymal origin. In the present study, a comparative analysis has been made between carnitine levels in a group of subjects made up of fertile males and another group composed of patients with varying degrees of oligo-asthenospermia. The levels of free carnitine were measured through the enzyme-colorimetry method of Marquis and Fritz. It was found that carnitine levels were significantly lower in the oligo-asthenospermic group, and that such levels decreased progressively as the degree of oligo-asthenospermia increased. On the other hand, a regression analysis showed an increase in carnitine values as seminogram parameters measuring sperm motility and maturation (vitality, active motility, hypo-osmotic test, sperm count per ml and total sperm count of ejaculate) increased. Such differences lead us to think that carnitine plays an important role in the maturation process and in development of sperm motility.</dc:description>
