<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED It has been recently reported that repeated large volume paracentesis (LVP) is a safe and efficacious procedure to treat cirrhotics with tense ascitis. In this paper we present the results of our experience with the use of this method. We studied 10 cirrhotics with tense ascites. The criteria for exclusion are described in the text. During LVP, iv albumin infusion was given (25 g each tap). Patients were followed during 3-4 months after discharge from the hospital. RESULTS Eighteen LVP were made in 10 patients. The mean age was 56 years (range 37-77). Six had peripheral edema. The mean volume of ascitic removed was 6.75 L (range 5-12) per tap. No clinic or hemodynamic complications were observed. With exception of serum cholesterol, which showed a decrease after LVP, laboratory tests did not show any significant modification. Two patients died 3 and 6 weeks after LVP due to hepatic failure and digestive hemorrhage. The procedure was well tolerated. Two were readmitted to the hospital after three months because of ascites. We conclude that LVP plus 25 g of i.v. albumin infusion is a safe and efficacious method to treat cirrhotic tense ascites. After three months no renal function impairment was observed. LVP decrease serum cholesterol.</dc:description>
