<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The Patient Autonomy Act should contribute to a "patient-centred" health care. The study objectives were to determine to what extent patients believe that their basic rights under the LAP (best practices) are being met. Secondly, to study the relationship between this performance and reported patient satisfaction levels. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS A total of 13,773 patients were interviewed (31.7% &gt;60 years and 53.6% women) receiving health care at 21 Spanish public hospitals. The number of "good practices" (GP) was analysed using descriptive statistics; relationship between GP and satisfaction was measured using logistic regression. RESULTS The medical discharge information was one of the most established practices. The compliance level ranged from 97.4% of parents of children over 6 years in paediatric service and 76.2% of patients attending obstetric services. The welcome process (Odds Ratio 3.53, IC-95% CI; 1.95-6.41, P&lt;0.001), informed consent (Odds Ratio 2.77, 95% CI; 1.40-5.47), to recognize which type of professional was providing care at all the times (Odds Ratio 3.36, 95% CI; 1.96-5.78), were the aspects that increased probability that the patient felt satisfied. CONCLUSIONS Compliance to patient rights was increased in all services analysed. When these rights are respected patient satisfaction increases.</dc:description>
