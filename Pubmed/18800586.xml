<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Urogenital prolapse is a condition that affects 1 to 43% of post-hysterectomized patients. Since several years some synthetic meshes have been used to repair pelvic floor, and apparently they have advantages over them predecessors. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and security of polypropylene meshes in the repair of urogenital prolapse. MATERIAL AND METHOD Retrospective and non-randomized study in 106 patients that had different kinds of urogenital prolapse repaired using polypropylene meshes. The follow-up was carried out by two visits to the hospital, 2 and 6 months after surgery. The variables analyzed were age, parity, menopause presence, kind of surgical technique, surgical time, time at hospital and complications. Afterwards, the information was analyzed descriptively. RESULTS Average age was 64.4 years. The rate of multiparity and menopause women was 91.51% and 92.45% respectively. The most used surgical technique was the anterior mesh with tension-free band (34,90%) to repair the associated urinary incontinence. The rate of intraoperatory complications was 2.8%, immediate complications was 37.7% and late complications was 21.6%. The success rate after 6 months was 80 to 100%, depending on the technique. CONCLUSIONS There is a low rate of intraoperatory and medium-term complications in the reconstructive surgery of pelvic floor for the urogenital prolapses using polypropylene meshes, which makes this technique a secure and effective option for the treatment of this problem.</dc:description>
