<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper addresses the proposition that even though there appears to be unanimity on the biomedical diagnosis of obesity, it is insufficient or not precise enough, since it is necessary to know more about the consequences of different lifestyles in ways of eating and the impact of lifestyles on the health of the population. Therefore, the paper reflects on how the biomedical ideation of obesity contributes to make body weight and food into what from a rather reductionist and controversial approach is defined as a "social problem." Lastly, the standardization of international strategies against obesity is considered, linked to its classification as a global epidemic, in order to reflect on the effects of dealing with a limited view of culture and food. The ideas articulated in this work are part of the theoretical problematization phase of the topic, prior to the implementation of the research project entitled a socio-anthropological approach to childhood obesity in three case studies: Spain, Mexico and Cuba.</dc:description>
