<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE the aim of the study was to assess the incidence, clinical presentation, location, and response to endoscopic therapy of gastrointestinal bleeding from Dieulafoy's lesion. MATERIAL AND METHOD ALL consecutive episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding due to Dieulafoy's lesion seen between 2000 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. All main clinical and endoscopic data were collected: type and effectiveness of endoscopic therapy, rebleeding, complications, and mortality during hospitalization. RESULTS WE found 41 patients, 26 males and 15 females, median age of 71.19 years. Dieulafoy's lesion accounted for 1.55% of all gastrointestinal bleeding episodes during the study period. The incidence of Dieulafoy's lesion was 2.2 cases/100.000 inhabitants/year. Active bleeding at endoscopy was present in 85.36%, and comorbidity in 92.68%. The stomach was the most frequent location (60.97%), followed by duodenum (29.26%). Endoscopic therapy achieved initial hemostasis in all cases. Three patients (7.31%) initially treated with epinephrine injection showed rebleeding and properly responded to a second session of endoscopic therapy. No surgery was needed. The mortality rate during hospitalization was 4.87%. CONCLUSIONS Dieulafoy's lesion is an uncommon, but potentially severe cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. It may be found in any location within the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic therapy is effective and safe. Injected epinephrine alone is associated with a higher risk of rebleeding.</dc:description>
