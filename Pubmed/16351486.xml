<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Lung cancer is the most common cause of death due to cancer in the world. Prognosis depends very much on a precocious diagnosis and treatment, being surgery the one that brings the best life expectancy. We studied the time between the diagnosis and the surgical treatment of lung cancer in the hospital area of Virgen Macarena, Sevilla. Making this way a determination of the surgical delay in the treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed retrospectively the patients who went under surgical treatment in our area between January 2003 and September 2004. And estimating the time in days, between the dates we obtained the first diagnostic specimen of lung cancer in this patients and the date the surgical treatment was performed. RESULTS We obtained a median of 31 days with a (recorrido intercuartílico) of 60, and a media of 46.16 with a standard deviation of 34.51. CONCLUSIONS When we compared the results obtained with that we found published, they were similar to those found in the literature.</dc:description>
