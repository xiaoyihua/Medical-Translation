<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Selective biopsy of the sentinel ganglion (SBSG) has replaced axillary lymphadectomy (AL) as the procedure of choice in staging breast cancer in its initial stages and in clinically negative axilla. The aim of this study is to compare global event-free survival of those patients subjected to SBSG followed by AL, during the period of validation of the technique, with respect to those subjected to SBSG and AL if the sentinel ganglion (SG) showed metastasis. METHODS One hundred and forty-eight patients were included, 81 belonging to the period of validation and 67 to the clinical application group. Radiocoloid was administered intraperitumorally, obtaining images up until the visualisation of the SG; its identification and extirpation were carried out subsequently in the surgical intervention. RESULTS The efficacy of the technique in the validation group was 92.5%, sensitivity was 95.6% and the rate of false negatives was 4%. Of the 81 patients, 75 are free of disease (92.6%). Of the 67 patients belonging to the clinical application group, 63 (94%) are free of disease. No patient has presented axillary ganglion recurrence. CONCLUSION In the validation of the technique we obtained values that fall within the demands of generally accepted quality. With an average follow up of 6 years we did not observe axillary ganglion recurrence in any of the two groups. There is no statistically significant difference in global and event free survival between the two groups.</dc:description>
