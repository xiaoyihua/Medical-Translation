<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The study goal was to evaluate the efficacy of CO₂ laser surgery in the treatment of laryngeal papillomatosis. We analysed several parameters such as gender, average age, relapse rate and viral serotype. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 26 diagnosed patients were included in this retrospective descriptive review. All of them were treated with CO₂ laser for laryngeal papillomas between 1995 and 2010. RESULTS This pathology was more prevalent in males (65.5%), with a slight predominance of a single larynx localisation over multiple lesion locations. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was detected in 75.8% of the cases; genotypes 6 and 11 prevailed. Of the patients in this review, 44.8% relapsed; the relapse average was 2-3 episodes per patient. A total of 20.7% of cases were in remission (no relapse in the last 2 months); 34.5%, clearing (no apparent relapse in the last 3 years); and 41.3% in the healing stage (without relapse in the last 5 years). There was only one case that showed malignancy. CONCLUSION Papillomatosis is characterised as a pathology with an unpredictable course and with a low probability of malignancy. CO₂ laser surgery has meant a revolution in symptomatic treatment, but there is presently no curative treatment.</dc:description>
