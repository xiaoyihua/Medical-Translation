<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Analysing the risk-factors associated with perception of self-image in middle-aged walkers. MATERIAL AND METHODS Four groups were evaluated regarding gender and age-group. Non-invasive morphological and functional variables were colleted and body image identification was processed using a set of numbered silhouettes. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in decision-making. RESULTS Greater risk-factors were found in both genders and among the age-groups being studied. There was a difference between genders regarding self-perceived body image and between two groups from the same gender. The volunteers wished to reduce their silhouettes. CONCLUSIONS The risk-factors were associated with self-perceived body image in both genders being studied here.</dc:description>
