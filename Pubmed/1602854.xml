<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of the present was to study the possible clinical histological correlations in the cases of lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LG) diagnosed in the last 10 years. Clinic evolutive data were collected in 7 patients diagnosed LG. The histological samples related to the same were revised and an immunohistochemical study was carried out with the oxidase/antiperoxidase technique. Seven patients (5 females and 2 men) with a mean age of 47 years (limit 23-47) were studied. The form of presentation was alteration of the general state in 5 cases accompanied by respiratory symptoms in 4. In 2 cases lung involvement was not found. In 7 biopsies performed at the initiation of the disease, 3 presented characteristics of lymphoma. Three patients are presently alive with a mean follow up time of 31 months and 4 have died (mean survival 17 months). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated T lymphocyte predominance in most of the cases (5 out of 6). The first case of LG in a patient simultaneously infected with the HIV and HTLV-1 is presented. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis possesses a symptomatology which is very inspecific and has histological features which may be superposed to other lymphoproliferative disorders, specially those of the T strain. Given the known relation between HTLV-1 and T lymphomas the role of HTLV-1 in the genesis of LG should be studied in these patients specially in those with the HIV.</dc:description>
