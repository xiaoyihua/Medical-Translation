<dc:description xml:lang="en">It is presented a case of a 62-year old male, with an illness of two months duration suggestive of an hepatic abscess; six months prior to admission he had surgery done because of a suspected cholelitiasis. Because of treatment failure and taking into account the result of the hepatic punctures (dark blood) with decreasing size of the liver, it was assumed to be a case of angioma. His intrahospital evolution was poor and died in hypovolemic shock complicated with acute pulmonary edema despite medical efforts. The post mortem study showed: a 13 cm. cavernous hepatic angioma, variable number of mesenteric, intestinal and cerebral angiomas. The surgical specimen of the gallbladder showed also angiomatosis. A brief review of the literature is done and particular emphasis is placed upon the clinical and angiographic studies of value to reach the diagnosis. The present case is similar to those in the literature because of the confusing clinical picture and fatal outcome.</dc:description>
