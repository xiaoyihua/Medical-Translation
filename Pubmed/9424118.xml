<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The epidemiologic information on AIDS derived exclusively from the AIDS case registry presents a series of limitations. To solve some of these epidemiologic surveillance systems of HIV infection have been designed. The information of the microbiology laboratories in which anti-HIV antibody detection tests are performed has been one of the most commonly used sources of information. MATERIAL AND METHOD The detection activity of the anti-HIV antibodies from a surveillance laboratory network in Catalonia from 1989 to 1995 was collected. RESULTS A continuous increase was observed in the number of tests performed in the network laboratories (30012 in 1989 up to 63323 in 1995) as was a significant decrease in the number of tests which were reactive (20.7% in 1989 to 6.1% in 1995). Great variability was found in the results among the different laboratories as well as in the diagnostic algorythms used. CONCLUSIONS Laboratories are an important source to take into account to perform epidemiologic surveillance of HIV infection. The collaboration among the laboratories and public health care officials allows information to be obtained that aids in better defining the characteristics of people who currently have HIV infection and in designing preventive activities directed at the needs of each community. This collaboration also allows homogeneous diagnostic algorythmns and common criteria to be established to ensure quality control.</dc:description>
