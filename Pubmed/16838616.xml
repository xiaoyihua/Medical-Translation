<dc:description xml:lang="en">Polyorchidism is an uncommon congenital defect. In fact, less than one hundred cases have been reported in the medical literature worldwide. This problem should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all scrotal masses. It is associated with multiple other urologic entities including malignancy. It is for this reason that it is important to be familiar with potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This diagnosis is usually documented by imaging, specifically doppler ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The risk of malignancy approaches 6% in Polyorchidism and therefore several authors have advocated surgery as the most appropriate therapeutic approach. However, recent reports suggest that asymptomatic patients with normal imaging could be observed. We present a 14 year old boy with polyorchidism which was diagnosed clinically and confirmed with imaging. His treatment and a review of the literature are presented as well.</dc:description>
