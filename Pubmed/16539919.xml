<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The objective of tuberculosis (TBC) control is to eradicate the disease by interrupting transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The WHO's strategy to achieve global control of this disease is known as directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS). The goals are to detect 70% of cases of bacilliferous TBC and to successfully treat 85% of these cases in order to reduce the number of sources of infection. Analysis of the epidemiology of TBC in Spain has revealed an incidence of &gt; 20 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. METHODS The strategies that should be applied are those for disease control: to improve case detection and treatment of cases with surveillance of cure (especially in contagious cases), to identify, investigate and treat individuals exposed to contagious persons, and to control epidemic outbreaks of TBC. Treatment of infected individuals is an elimination strategy and should be reserved for groups at high risk of developing the disease.</dc:description>
