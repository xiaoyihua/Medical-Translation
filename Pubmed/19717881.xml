<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Primary prostatic tuberculosis is a very rare form of presentation of the tuberculous infection, which is generally caused by the M. tuberculosis, and which has shown an increase in incidence and prevalence, due to an increase of immunocompromised patients and the pandemic of the Syndrome of Acquired Immune Deficiency (AIDS).We describe a case of primary prostatic tuberculosis attended at the Hospital Universitario de Santander, Colombia, and to perform a discussion about this topic. METHODS/RESULTS 65 year old man who consulted with symptoms of frequency, dysuria and hesitancy, and 10 Kg weight loss in the last 6 months, without pulmonary symptoms and negative ELISA test for HIV. On physical examination there was evidenceof the presence of a high volume, irregular and hard prostatic gland. That is why a prostatic Doppler ecography was performed showing a prostatic volume of 39 cm3, without sign of malignity. Biopsy of the prostatic gland showed multiple granulomas and the ZN staining was positive for mycobacteria. With these findings the diagnosis of primary prostatic tuberculosis was established, and treatment was carried out and now the patient is asymptomatic with no evidence of active tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS Primary prostatic tuberculosis without history or evidence of commitment of the immune system is a very rare condition, nevertheless, it is particularly important to know it due to the progressive increase of its presentation and the possibility of a curative treatment to affected patients.</dc:description>
