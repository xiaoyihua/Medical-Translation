<dc:description xml:lang="en">A close comparative study of the hypotensive effects of verapamil and chlorthalidone was carried out on 60 patients affected with mild essential hypertension showing systemic. I-II OMS affectation degree, during 9 weeks. Both, the calcium channel blockers and the diuretics produced statistically significant decreases in the arterial pressure, being more evident with verapamil. An adequate control of the hypertension was achieved with both drugs, the results produced with verapamil (from 2nd week) being more important and quicker. The biochemical control did give the best results with verapamil, however, because it did not modify the plasmatic levels of cholesterol, uric acid and potassium. We concluded that the calcium channel blocker must be included in the therapeutic arsenal against essential hypertension, verapamil being the first choice because of its efficacy, tolerance and minimal alterations o in the biochemical blood test.</dc:description>
