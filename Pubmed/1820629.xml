<dc:description xml:lang="en">Rosario, with a million inhabitants, is the second major urban concentration in Argentina and serves as the commercial and industrial center for a large area. In view of the lack of information on the present prevalence of smoking in this area as for the country as a whole, a study was performed on random samples of young people and university students of medicine and economics, as well as on their parents. Information was obtained on their life smoking habits, education and occupation. The prevalence of the habit was higher: a) in men, both in the youngsters and their parents; b) in medical students than in those of the economic sciences; c) in parents with university education. The smoking habit of these subjects and parents was highly associated (p less than 0.001) in the sample of young people, although no association was found between the prevalence of smoking among university students and their parents. Peer smoking was the main factor influencing the onset of cigarette smoking given by 69% of the subjects. Knowledge of specific adverse health effects of smoking was poor. Attitudes toward restrictive measures were highly associated (p less than 0.001) with the non-smoker category. Based on these findings, we conclude that while there is a need for educational programs for the population in general, the university as a whole and specifically the school of medicine should implement a program to increase knowledge and awareness on this public health problem.</dc:description>
