<dc:description xml:lang="en">Primary intra-osseous carcinoma (PIOC) is a rare tumor, defined as squamous cell carcinoma that develops in the jaw bones, having no initial connection to adjacent skin or mucosa. It is locally aggressive, with metastases to regional lymph nodes, (28% of cases) and lung (5% of cases) at the time of diagnosis. Its origin may be di novo or from other odontogenic tumors. The maxillary bones have epithelial tissues; therefore this neoplasm is located exclusively on this site, predominantly in the jaw. PIOC diagnostic criteria are strict and include: squamous cell carcinoma histopathology, lack of commitment and sinus mucosa, ruling out the possibility of metastasis from a distant site with a thorough clinical study and complementary methods. The treatment is, whenever possible, oncologic resection, additional radio and / or chemotherapy. Reconstructive surgery with graft and / or prostheses for aesthetic and functional are also required. We report the case of a 72 years old man who consulted for sore jaw three months after molar extraction. Curettage biopsy was performed and then resected mandible with lymphadenectomy. Histopathological examination showed a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, infiltrating jawbone with morphological findings linking him to residual odontogenic cyst and metastatic lymph nodes in 15 of 48 isolates. Postoperative radiotherapy was performed, he died at 30 months of diagnosis by progressive deterioration.</dc:description>
