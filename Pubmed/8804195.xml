<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To find the profile of the Family Planning (FP) service, the contraceptive methods used, prescribed and asked for, evaluating the knowledge acquired in the prior informative talk. DESIGN A crossover observational study. SETTING Family Planning service in Telde (Gran Canaria). PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS 317 users for whom a clinical record was opened in 1992/3. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Average age was 28.23 +/- 0.75 (SD 6.76); 77.6% were married, 66.56% without paid work and 22.71% with medium or higher education. 62.77% were from our Health Area. 82.33% attended on their own initiative. 2.26 +/- 0.07 (SD 0.59) contraceptive methods per user were used, with 71.87% medically monitored. 98.74% had used hormonal contraception (HC). The average number of pregnancies was 1.45 +/- 0.13 (SD 1.2), with the first being on average at age 22.16 +/- 0.48 (SD 3.74). 32.67% used barrier methods and 35.31% hormonal ones (36.4% smoked), with significant differences for age-groups, the referring professional and the number of children. 60% asked for an IUD and 37.38% HC, where significant differences were found for marital status, age groups, educational level and the number of children. CONCLUSIONS We must strengthen the FP service so that people can make the most of their sexual and reproductive lives, increasing coverage for adolescents to prevent unwanted pregnancies and avoid uncontrolled risky contraceptive methods. The information in the prior talks should be improved, which would make the questionnaires administered more valid.</dc:description>
