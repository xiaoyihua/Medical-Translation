<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Anaplastic thyroid cancer ranks among the most lethal of all known human malignancies, and remains almost uniformly fatal. It represents approximately 1% of all thyroid carcinomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study was performed including all anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cases diagnosed in our institution between 1989 and 2000. RESULTS We collected 15 cases previously biopsied as anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Three of them were treated with a curative intention; different palliative modalities were carried out for the remaining cases. None of the cases survived more than 1 year, and the median survival time was 3.5 months. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION This study confirms the previously known aggressiveness of this neoplasm, in which the prognosis and evolution remain to be fatal.</dc:description>
