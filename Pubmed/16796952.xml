<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Polypropylene (PP) mesh is one of the most frequently used materials in the surgical repair of ventral hernias. Despite the widely recognized ability of PP to integrate into the host tissue, these meshes may shrink during the healing process in the patient. OBJECTIVE To quantify polypropylene mesh shrinkage. PATIENTS AND METHOD A radiological follow-up study was performed in 23 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for midline ventral hernias with diameters of at least 5 cm. PP meshes were marked with titanium clips at the ends of their longest transverse and longitudinal axes. X-rays were performed on the first postoperative day and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. The distances between clips were measured and the area of the mesh was calculated. RESULTS Seventeen women and six men underwent surgery. In nine patients the mesh was placed on the prefascial space (onlay) and in 14 in the subfascial space (sublay). There were four seromas in patients with mesh placed with the onlay technique. The reduction in the calculated area was 12% at 1 month, 24% at 3 months, 29% at 6 months and 34% at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS PP mesh provided excellent clinical results. Radiological surveillance revealed substantial shrinkage, mainly in the first 3 months after implantation.</dc:description>
