<dc:description xml:lang="en">The biological and clinical features and prognostic factors of 65 patients affected by alcoholic hepatitis were studied. All patients had an ethanol intake higher than 80 gr/day during at least 3 years. 22 patients were female and 43 male with a mean age of 45 +/- 11.7 years. 19 had acute hepatitis (29.2%), 2 had acute hepatic insufficiency (3%), one had acute cholestasis (1.5%), 14 had chronic hepatopathy (21.5%). 29 patients had the diagnosis (44.6%) confirmed by histologic analysis. All patients had liver enlargement, 25 had jaundice and 4 had fever. The hepatic biopsies showed steatosis in 53 cases, centrilobular sclerosis in 32 cases and cirrhosis in 19.8 patients developed hepatic encephalopathy, 3 had renal insufficiency, and 4 died. The levels of albumin (P = 0.0043), total bilirubin (P = 0.0003), prothrombin (P = 0.0001) and the development of hepatic encephalopathy or/and renal insufficiency were the parameters to define the group of patients with bad evolution, the IgA also being significant. The low mortality of our studied (6.1%) can be justified by the diagnosis at non-symptomatic stage. We recommend a liver biopsy in all patients with chronic alcoholism and liver enlargement, or biologic markers suggesting alcoholic hepatopathy.</dc:description>
