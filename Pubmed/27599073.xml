<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To estimate the potential underestimation of mortality from traffic injuries at the subnational level in Mexico for a period of 15 years and to identify social and economic variables at the state level that could potentially be associated with the quality of statistical classification of deaths. MATERIALS AND METHODS Secondary analysis of validated mortality databases for the period 1999-2013 was conducted. Using multiple imputation models, registries that could potentially be attributed to road traffic deaths were estimated and the potential underestimation of mortality due to this external cause was quantified. A simple correlation analysis was carried out. RESULTS The potential underestimation of deaths from traffic injuries during the period was 18.85% at the national level, with significant variations by state. From the data analyzed, there was no statistical evidence of any association of the percentage of road traffic deaths underestimation with the variables analyzed. CONCLUSIONS Performance in terms of mortality classification is different at the state level in Mexico. This information is useful for targeting interventions to improve the recording of deaths in the country.</dc:description>
