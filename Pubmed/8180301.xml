<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To find how users identified non-steroidal analgesic/antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and their adverse reactions, as well as where the prescriptions were obtained and where users inquired when in doubt. DESIGN An observation study carried out by means of a structured questionnaire administered to 174 residents in our basic health area. SETTING Cerro del Aguila Basic Health Area in Sevilla. PARTICIPANTS The 174 residents, chosen at random, by quotas corresponding to the Census' demographic characteristics. People under 15 were excluded. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS 32.2% had no spontaneous memory of having taken any NSAID: 86.8% did not remember any possible adverse reaction to medication. Only 49.3% of the NSAID declared were prescribed by a doctor. 17.8% took NSAID daily and 5.7% took more than one medicine containing NSAID every day. CONCLUSIONS In our health area, health education, both to identify NSAID as a pharmacological group and any possible adverse reactions, needs to be strengthened.</dc:description>
