<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse the length and area of corneal surface occupied by vessels, and their location in an experimental model of alkali burn-induced corneal neovascularization. METHODS An injury to the central cornea of the right eye in 91 Sprague-Dawley rats was induced using a silver nitrate pencil. The rats were divided in 7 groups that were sacrificed 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 days post-injury, and then perfused with a mixture of Chinese ink in PBS -phosphate buffer saline-. Corneas were flat-mounted processed and divided in 4 quadrants. Corneal neovascular growth parameters (length and area) and the location of these vessels were performed blind. The results were statistically analysed. RESULTS Neovascular growth was observed from day 2, reaching its maximum peak in length and area on the 12th day post-injury. A slight reduction in corneal neovascularization was observed after this day. The vessels were initially located in the middle third of the stroma and tended to be observed in the anterior third during the course of the experiment. CONCLUSIONS Neovascularisation was observed on day 2 post-injury in all sectors of corneal surface. Neovascular growth was uniform during the experiment. Neovessels were located in the middle and anterior third of the cornea.</dc:description>
