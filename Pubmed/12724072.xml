<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate exposure to the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease in children from Medellín according to age, sex, type of school, and socioeconomic status. METHOD We performed a descriptive study in 2611 children aged 6-18 years old from the city of Medellín in Colombia. Lipid profile, blood pressure, body mass index, diet, exercise, alcohol intake, and smoking were evaluated. RESULTS Forty-six percent of the children drank alcohol, 8.7 % smoked and 50 % were physically inactive. Fat and carbohydrate intake was high in 48 % and 47 %, respectively. A total of 9.3 % of the children were overweight and 4.6 % were obese. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were high in 1.3 % and 3.9 %, respectively. Mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) values were lower than in other populations, while triglyceride values were higher. Differences in serum lipid concentrations were found according to age and sex. The prevalence of risk factors according to the National Cholesterol Education Program criteria were: 19.1 % for HDL-C, 17.1 % for triglycerides, 17.0 % for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 13.5 % for total cholesterol (TC) and 22.9 % for TC/HDL-C. CONCLUSIONS In children from the city of Medellín, the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factors were related to lifestyle. Mean plasma lipid concentrations varied according to age and sex. The prevalence of overweight was higher than in other populations in Colombia but was lower than that reported for other countries.</dc:description>
