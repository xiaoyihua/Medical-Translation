<dc:description xml:lang="en">Serological and genetic methods were used to study 18 leptospiral strains isolated from patients with leptospirosis in 3 Cuban provinces. The strains were grouped by microscopic agglutination with 8 polyclonal antisera. Nine monoclonal antibodies served to determine the strain serovars. Alternatively, DNA was extracted from these strains and applied by a polymerase chain reaction system described for pathogenic leptospiras. Amplified DNA was digested by restriction enzymes Alu I and Hae III. MAT grouped the strains among serogroups Ballum, Ponoma, Canicula and Icterohaemorrhagiae. Monoclonal antibodies determined the serovars of seven of the studied strains. For all the strains, an amplified fragment of 631 pb was obtained by polymerase chain reaction. The analysis of the amplified product with restriction enzymes revealed similar patterns of restriction in all the strains. The used methods made it possible to identify all the strains at different levels. It is also pointed out that the use of monoclonal antibodies allowed to typify seven strains up to the serovar level.</dc:description>
