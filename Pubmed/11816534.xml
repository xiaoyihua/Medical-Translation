<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the clinical characteristic and evolution of papillary thyroid cancer with pregnancy and know the optimal time to treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cohort analytic study with two groups: One with 6 papillary cancer and pregnancy and group 2 with 24 papillary cancer and the same age, prognostic score AMES and MACIS, treatment, time of follow up and mortality. The variables analyzed was clinical presentation, local, regional, distant recurrence, and mortality. The statistical analyzed by Chi Square and t test. RESULTS There were no statistical differentiation between the two groups in age, prognostic score, rates of recurrence and mortality with a time of follow up for G1 83 (33 to 240) months and 88 (12 to 288) months for G2. There were differences only in clinical presentation with positive cervical nodes in 100% of patients in G1 vs. 12.5% in G2. This condition does not alter the final evolution. CONCLUSION A pregnant patient with papillary thyroid cancer can wait the end of the pregnancy and then receive the appropriated cancer treatment.</dc:description>
