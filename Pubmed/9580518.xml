<dc:description xml:lang="en">The diaphragm is the main inspiratory muscle. It is composed of two parts, the costal and crural, with both anatomical and functional differences. The general morphometric characteristics of the diaphragm have been described in various species but homogeneity throughout the muscle has not been adequately studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fiber phenotype of various parts of the diaphragm. The entire diaphragm muscles of five New Zealand rabbits were removed and each was divided into quarters. The specimens were processed for morphometry (hematoxyllineosin stains, NADH-TR and ATPase at pH levels of 4.2, 4.6 and 9.4). For each portion we measured percent and size of fibers, expressing the latter as minimum diameter (Dm), measured area (Ar) and calculated area (Ac). Left and right diaphragm hemispheres (20 portions examined) were similar for fiber percentages and sizes. For left and right halves, respectively 50 +/- 2 and 51 +/- 4% of fibers were type I; type I Dm measurements were 38 +/- 5 and 41 +/- 4 microns; type I Ar values were 1798 +/- 481 and 2030 +/- 390 micron 2; type I Ac values were 1181 +/- 360 and 1321 +/- 382 micron 2; type II Dm values were 46 +/- 4 and 46 +/- 5 microns; type II Ar values were 2466 +/- 388 micron 2 and 2539 +/- 456 micron 2; type II Ac data were 1642 +/- 255 and 1655 +/- 382 micron 2. We likewise found no differences between costal and crural portions of the muscle (n = 20). For costal and crural portions, respectively, 50 +/- 3 and 50 +/- 2% of fibers were type I; type I Dm sizes were 39 +/- 5 and 40 +/- 4 microns; type I Ar measurements were 1859 +/- 521 and 1964 +/- 365 micron 2; type I Ac figures were 1231 +/- 317 and 1266 +/- 288 micron 2; type II Dm were 47 +/- 4 and 44 +/- 3 microns; type II Ar were 2563 +/- 481 and 2430 +/- 331 micron 2; type II Ac were 1729 +/- 373 and 1557 +/- 212 micron 2. Type II fibers, however, were somewhat larger than type I fibers in all portions (p = 0.001). New Zealand rabbit diaphragm muscle has similar percentages of slow and rapid contraction fibers. The size is not different from that observed in other species of mammals of similar size. Fiber type proportions are similar throughout the muscle, with more type II fibers present in all areas. The morphometric characters, therefore, suggest an homogeneous throughout the diaphragm, suggesting homogeneous response of the muscle to usual loads, and also suggesting the possibility of proposing longitudinal morphometric studies using this species as a model.</dc:description>
