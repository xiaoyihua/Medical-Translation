<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To describe newly diagnosed HIV infections from the HIV Reporting System in Catalonia (2001-2003), and to compare the characteristics of the epidemic based on the use of the HIV Reporting System and the Catalonian AIDS Registry versus those based on the Catalonian AIDS Registry alone. METHODS Data were collected from newly diagnosed HIV infections and AIDS cases between 2001 and 2003 in Catalonia. RESULTS Among the newly diagnosed HIV infections (1,765) the most frequent route of HIV infection was heterosexual transmission (46.8%), followed by men who had sex with men (26.7%), and injecting drug use (19.9%). Out of the 1,210 AIDS cases, the most common route of HIV transmission was injecting drug used (42.2%), followed by (heterosexual transmission 34.5%) and MSM (18.0%). Comparison of routes of HIV transmission in the two reporting systems (HIV/AIDS versus AIDS) revealed statistically significant differences. CONCLUSIONS The HIV/AIDS Reporting System based on reporting of newly diagnosed HIV infections is feasible, since it has been useful in achieving the objectives of epidemiological HIV infection surveillance. It also provides more accurate information than does the AIDS Registry, which can be used to describe recent patterns of HIV transmission. The completeness of the new reporting system may be enhanced by including the diagnosis of HIV infection among the diseases of mandatory notification.</dc:description>
