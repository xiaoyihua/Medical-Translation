<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Advanced ovarian neoplasm has bad prognosis. There is little knowledge as to the effect of surgical and chemotherapy treatments on long-term survival. METHODS Seventy-two patients with advanced epithelial ovary carcinoma (53 stage III and 19 stage IV) were treated according to a treatment regimen with reduction surgery, five cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and cisplatin (CAP) followed by second revision laparotomy. RESULTS The rate of response for the CAP schedule was 80%, of which 16 patients (23%) showed complete response (CR), 7 (10%) partial microscopic response (PMiR) and 33 (47%) partial macroscopic response (PMR). Complete resection of residual masses was performed on the second laparotomy in 14 of the 33 patients with parital response. The median survival for all the group was 36 months with overall actuarial survival of 27% at 10 years. The survival of the group of patients with CR was significantly longer than that of PMiR and other groups. Significant differences favorable for the group of partial response with second attempt radical surgery were found versus the group in which te second surgical resection was not radical. FIGO III stage and prechemotherapy tumor size less than 5 cm were found to have favorable effect in the rate of response and survival. CONCLUSIONS The use of CAP chemotherapy achieved complete response in 23% of the patients studied. This group of patients showed to have a greater probability of longer survival. Second attempt surgery on the second laparotomy offers therapeutic benefits when radical.</dc:description>
