<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Tendon sheath lipoma is an uncommon tumor characterized morphologically by mature fatty tissue lobes adherent to the tendon or intersecting its fibers. The association with quadriceps tendon rupture is unusual. Etiologic factors that may condition those ruptures have not yet been fully described. However, several authors suggest the existence of a subjacent pathology such as metabolic or inflammatory diseases. Minimal trauma may lead to such ruptures as well as associated ligamentous or bony injuries. The prognosis regarding quadriceps tendon rupture mainly depends on the lap between injury and time of repair. CLINICAL CASE We present the case of a quadricipital tendinous rupture produced by the presence of a benign neoplasm, which is a very infrequent association. The patient was surgically treated for quadriceps tendon reconstruction via tendinous reinsertion at the patella. Currently, during rehabilitation, the patient is symptom free with an almost-complete flexion/ extension of his left knee. CONCLUSIONS We consider that importance must be given to neoplastic disease as a cause of tendinous rupture, regardless of their infrequency and unusual clinical presentation.</dc:description>
