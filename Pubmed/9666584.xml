<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the etiology of phlebitis (chemical or infectious) and the prevalence of infections related to intravascular catheters (IRIC) in patients with HIV infection admitted to a 22-bed Infectious Disease Unit with a high rate of HIV infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS A 3-month prospective study from November 1, 1994 to January 31, 1995 was carried out following a formula for data collection of all the intravenous catheters used during that time period. Cultures of the catheters withdrawn on Wednesdays and those with signs of phlebitis were performed. RESULTS One hundred fifty-two intravenous catheters in 71 patients with HIV infection with a mean age of 37 years (range: 21-73) and mean hospital stay of 10.2 days were reported. During the study period 42 phlebitis were produced, of which 37 catheters (7 central and 30 peripheral) were processed. Of the 37 phlebitis processed, 29 (78.9%) were considered to be of physiochemical origin. Of the 21 catheters withdrawn Wednesday, 18 were processed, 8 with phlogotic signs, 2 with IRCI, equivalent to 1.9 IRCI/100 days of catheterization. During the study period no local or severe systemic infections related to the catheter were reported. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the organism involved in all the cases of IRCI. CONCLUSIONS Despite the high number of immunosuppressed patients in related to HIV infection, a greater incidence of IRCI was not found in these patients. The most frequent cause of phlebitis by catheter was of chemical origin.</dc:description>
