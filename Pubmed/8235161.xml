<dc:description xml:lang="en">The need for folate supplementation in patients on chronic hemodialysis receiving erythropoietin (EPO) remains to be determined. Thirty five patients on chronic hemodialysis were studied; of these 10 did not receive EPO nor folic acid, 12 received EPO with folic acid supplementation and the rest only EPO. In these groups, after 9 +/- 2.9 months of treatment, serum folate levels were normal, although higher in those patients supplemented with folate. An additional group of 8 patients, previously supplemented with 2 mg/week of folate, was studied during the first 10 weeks of EPO treatment. In these patients a significant decrease in serum folate was observed from the first to the tenth week (from 18 +/- 29 to 7 +/- 4 ng/ml). Red cell folate had an unexplained raise during the first four weeks and went back to near basal levels during the next weeks. As expected serum ferritin levels decreased at the end of the study period, but remained over 100 ng/ml Red blood cell protoporphyrin remained normal. We thus recommend the measurement of serum and red cell folate levels during the first and tenth weeks of the induction phase of EPO treatment. Also, folic acid supplementation in doses of 2 mg/week is recommended to maintain adequate body stores, specially in extremely anorectic hemodialysis patients or those in whom strict diets without fruits are prescribed.</dc:description>
