To identify the most frequent complications associated with the surgical intervention. 3). To compare the behaviour of sexual satisfaction in partners and patients with penile prosthesis implant before and after the application of the treatment. METHODS A descriptive, (longitudinal) study with quantitative and qualitative methodology was done, where 25 men with penile prosthesis implants, performed at Faustino Perez Hospital, were evaluated.
