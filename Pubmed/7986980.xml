<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse the frequency of attendance and the time elapsed between the diagnosis of Arterial Hypertension (AHT) and the control of Arterial Pressure (AP); and to analyse the different ways of presenting the level of control of AHT. DESIGN Retrospective study. SETTING Teaching Health Centre. PATIENTS 103 hypertense patients diagnosed since 1986: 44 men (42.7%) and 59 women (57.3%), with an average age of 52.6 +/- 1. Their initial AP was 164.4 +/- 17.1/102.1 +/- 7.4 mmHg. The criterion of AHT control was Diastolic Arterial Pressure (DAP) &lt; 90 mmHg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS AP at the end of the first year was 150.1 +/- 20.6/90.7 +/- 9.6 mmHg (p &lt; 0.001 in comparison with the initial AP). The average attendances for AHT and per patient in the first year was 8.7 +/- 5 (1-26). Patients with more severe forms of AHT and/or with associated risk factors visited more often (p &lt; 0.05). During the first year 76 patients (73.7%) presented on at least one attendance a controlled DAP. At the end of the first year 46 patients (44.6%) were under control. The average time per patient until AP was controlled was 28.6 +/- 31.6 weeks (1-168). Males and under-65s took more time to control their AP (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS There are gender and age differences in the time required to bring AP under control. Frequency of attendance is related to the severity of AHT and the presence of other pathologies and risk factors. The level of control of AHT, expressed in different ways, is not constant.</dc:description>
