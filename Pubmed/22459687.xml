<dc:description xml:lang="en">An increase in infections by filamentous fungi other than Aspergillus has been observed in the last few years. Clear fungi or hyalohyphomycetes, dematiaceous or dark fungi, agents of mucormycosis, and Pneumocystis jirovecii are generally emerging opportunistic fungi that produce disseminated infection in patients with severe immunosuppression. The clinical manifestations in this group of patients are often non-specific as their expression is modified by the disease itself or by the concomitant treatments, which difficult early diagnosis. This, together with the relatively limited therapeutic resources available, has led to invasive fungal infections by these filamentous fungi being associated with significant mortality (30-100%). Nowadays with the emergence of the new triazole drugs or lipid formulations of amphotericin B, often combined with other antifungal drugs, attempts are being made to change the dire prognosis of patients with these infections.</dc:description>
