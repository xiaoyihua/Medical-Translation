<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Ventilatory requirements increase during exercise. The respiratory muscles of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at a particular disadvantage when dealing with such increased demand. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in respiratory muscles brought on by exercise in such patients. METHODS Twelve patients with severe CFOPD (FEV1 &lt; 50% ref., 63 +/- 7 years) were enrolled. Breathing patterns and esophageal (Pes and transdiaphragmatic (Pdi) pressures and SaO2 were measured during submaximal exercise/Ecsbmax, 60% of the maximum tolerated load). A sniff maneuver was performed with the patients breathing ambient air with added oxygen to achieve 99% SaO2. We also measured level of FRC by inductive plethysmograph in a subgroup of five patients. RESULTS During EXsbmáx, SaO2 decreased (from 95.0 +/- 2.1 to 92.3 +/- 4.0%; p &lt; 0.01); Vt increased (717 +/- 199 to 990 +/- 297 cc, p &lt; 0.01), as did respiratory rate (RR, 17 +/- 6 a 28 +/- 9; p &lt; 0.01). Pes and Pdi were greater at Vt, changing from -12.4 +/- 4.8 to -27.0 +/- 10.1 and 16.6 +/- 6.1 to 30.4 +/- 12.4 cmH2O, respectively (p &lt; 0.01 in both cases), whereas no significant changes were observed for maximal effort (Pesmax, -61.4 +/- 16.5 cersus -65.9 +/- 15.2 cmH2O; Pdimac 89.7 +/- 26.1 versus 81.7 +/- 35.7 cmH2O). Used as a global measure, Pdi/Pdimáx worsened (0.21 +/- 0.12 a 0.42 +/- 0.20; p &lt; 0.01), as dud the diaphragm tension-time (TTdi; 0.07 +/- 0.04 to 0.15 +/- 0.06, p &lt; 0.01). Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi) increased an estimated 2.7 +/- 2.1 to 9.4 +/- 5.8 cmH2O (p &lt; 0.001), while FRC (delta 357 +/- 274 ml). Durante el EXsbmáx with oxygen supplementation, SaO2 did not decrease. However supplementation, though Ti/TTOT and maximal pressures remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory muscle function changes induced by Exsbmáx seem to relate mainly to a worsening of system mechanics.</dc:description>
