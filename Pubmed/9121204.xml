<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The methods and characteristics of clinical data gathered at the initial steps of development of a computerized system to aid medical diagnosis are reported. The objectives of the study were as follows: to describe the overall method and to set a framework for developing an intellectual model of the medical diagnosis procedure. MATERIAL AND METHODS A structured medical interview and physical examination using an informatic program on PC compatible portable computers were completed in a sample 1,238 patients attending the outpatient clinics of our institution. Data obtained were compared with information in the patient's medical record taking as reference pattern the record of physicians in charge of the patients. Diagnosis were codified according to WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM). RESULTS The distribution of symptoms and signs corresponding to the different organs and systems was analyzed. Each subdivision afforded a range of 1.3 to 3.9 abnormal findings per patient. A total of 3,571 diagnoses were codified for the whole group 1,238 patients with a mean (standard deviation) of 3 (2) diagnoses per patient (range 0-12). The distribution of diagnostic groups varied depending on the consideration of the main diagnosis or the concomitant diagnoses that defined the patient's clinical context. The most frequent main diagnoses included tumors, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and genitourinary tract diseases. CONCLUSIONS As shown by results obtained in a sample of 1,238 patients, there is a very complex situation in clinical practice due to the simultaneous occurrence of several clinical patterns. This finding should be taken into account when developing clinical decision making support systems. The use of a structured medical interview or a structured and standard medical visit may be an adequate tool to clarify this matter and to contribute to standardization of clinical concepts and situations.</dc:description>
