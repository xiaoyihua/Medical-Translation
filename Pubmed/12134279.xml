<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The presence of alterations in the neuroimaging in patients with anosmia without traumatic antecedents is not frequent. CASE REPORT Male aged 38 who came to surgery after having suffered, 6 months earlier, for 1 week, a picture of intense, oppressive holocranial headache, accompanied by fever. Associated with this, an acute complete anosmia also began and persisted up to the moment the patient came for consultation. It was not associated with any infection of the respiratory tract, there was no history of cranial trauma, no ingestion of medicines nor toxins, nor had he been exposed to toxic products. The exploration to which he was submitted only showed an anosmia and was otherwise found to be normal. Cranial MRI showed signal alterations in both lower (orbitary) convolutions of the frontal lobes, in the anterior region of the right temporal lobe and in both olfactory nerves. Tests for HIV serology, parotiditis, hepatitis B and C virus, HSV, VZV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and lues were negative. The acute onset of the anosmia in midst of a picture of febricula and headaches made us suspect the presence of an infectious aetiology, and the alterations found in the neuroimaging could be due to post encephalic lesions, with a special predilection for olfactory areas. CONCLUSIONS 1. MRI plays a fundamental role in the topographic and aetiological evaluation of olfactory dysfunctions of a central origin; 2. Affectation of the central olfactory passages of an infectious aetiology in a non HIV patient and with neuroimaging findings is a rare complication.</dc:description>
