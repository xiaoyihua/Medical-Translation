<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE We undertook this study to identify risk factors in our population associated with trigger finger. The study was conducted at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, UMAE 21, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. METHODS This was a case-control, retrospective, and observational study. There were 250 patients in each group. For cases, patients who were operated on for trigger finger from March 2006 to August 2006 were included. Controls included patients admitted to the Emergency Department with hand injuries that fulfilled the selection criteria. Risk factors analyzed were diabetes, hypertension, smoking, sex, age, weight, and 19 different occupations. RESULTS Mean age of the cases was 52 years (SE +/- 14.19 years) with a median and mode of 53 years. The right hand was the most common with the middle, thumb, ring, index and little fingers, respectively. A significant statistical relationship was found: females (OR 7.57, 95% CI 5.07-11.31); diabetes (OR 3.72, 95% CI 2.43-5.70); obesity (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.02-2.19). With regard to occupation, a statistical relationship was found: homemaker (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.62-3.69); seamstress (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.3-21.6); and secretary (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.38-5.52). CONCLUSIONS Trigger finger is a common pathology in our population and is more frequent in women &gt;53 years old. It may be related to diabetes, body mass index (obesity) and certain occupations such as secretary, seamstress and homemaker.</dc:description>
