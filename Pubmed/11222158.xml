<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND It is well known that smoking and some nutritional habits are two of the most important risk factors for the development of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this study is to assess the food and nutrient consumption in relation to smoking in the Catalan population, Spain. SUBJECTS AND METHOD A representative sample of the Catalan population of 1774 people aged 18 to 64 years from both sexes. Nutritional status was evaluated using selected anthropometrical indexes, and food consumption with two 24-hour recall. Questionnaires about smoking consumption and a semiquantitative frequency questionnaire about alcohol consumption were also administered. RESULTS Male non smokers consumed more dairy products than smokers, and more fruits and nuts than smokers and ex-smokers. Female non-smokers consumed more chicken, fruits and less sweets than smokers and ex-smokers. In both genders, smokers consumed more alcohol. With respect to nutrients, smokers consumed less fiber than non smokers and more energy from lipids and saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. CONCLUSIONS The diet of smokers is less healthy than that of non smokers and ex-smokers, which indicates a higher risk for the incidence of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases.</dc:description>
