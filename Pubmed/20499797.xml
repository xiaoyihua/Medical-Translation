<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine first-year medical residents' perception of their competence in basic life support (BLS) and the use of automatic external defibrillation (AED). MATERIAL AND METHODS Course in BLS and AED accredited by the European Resuscitation Council with pre- and post-course self-assessment. The post-training questionnaire was administered immediately after the course and 8 months later. The data recorded covered (a) prior training and experience, (b) self-assessment of BLS and AED skills (9 items, scored 1-5), (c) the skill considered most difficult, and (d) satisfaction (13 items, scored 0-10). RESULTS The questionnaire was initially completed by 71 residents; 31 also responded 8 months later. Self-assessment scores improved immediately after the course (P = .0001). Scores had fallen 8 months later (P = .0001) but were still significantly higher than pre-course perception of skill (P = .017). More than 95% of the residents considered themselves to be competent after the course and more than 80% felt competent 8 months later, with the exception of skills in bag-mask ventilation (74.2%) and removal of a foreign body (61.3%). The skill considered most difficult was bag-mask ventilation. Mean (SD) BLS and AED scores for real-life situations were 8.48 (1.33) and 9.19 (0.94), respectively, after the course and 7.32 (1.4) and 7.29 (1.32) at 8 months (P = .0001). Overall satisfaction was high. CONCLUSIONS The residents perceived themselves as competent to give BLS and AED immediately after the course and 8 months after training, although fewer felt as competent at the second assessment. Bag-mask ventilation was considered the most difficult skill.</dc:description>
