<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM A study is made to show that most pediatric oral surgical interventions can be performed on a day case surgery or ambulatory basis, and to describe the activity of the Master of Oral Surgery and Implantology (Barcelona University Dental School, Spain) in the year 2000. DESIGN The study documents the surgical activity of the Units of Oral Surgery and Laser Surgery in pediatric patients, in the context of the Master of Oral Surgery and Implantology (Barcelona University Dental School, Spain). RESULTS Of the 3187 operations carried out in our Service in this period, 489 involved patients under 18 years of age. The surgical removal of third molars was the most common intervention (55.6%), followed by other surgical or non-surgical tooth extractions (33.6%) and other interventions (10.6%) comprising fenestration of impacted canines or other teeth, frenectomies, the removal of mucoceles, and tooth relocations. Complications after surgical third molar extraction were recorded in 15.93% of cases, the most frequent problem being the pain and swelling (4.35% each) characteristic of postoperative inflammation. CONCLUSIONS Our experience shows that day case oral surgery can be safely performed in pediatric patients, provided the required means and health care personnel resources are available.</dc:description>
