<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Identification of factors which can condition the perception by Primary Care professionals of success in health promotion. DESIGN An observation study of a crossover type. PARTICIPANTS 106 professionals (doctors, nurses and social workers) from 22 health centres in the province of Toledo, who filled in a questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A non-conditional, multiple, logistic regression analysis was used. The professional satisfied with his/her work, not a doctor and who worked in a health centre open for less than 3 years, presented, against their opposite values, greater probability (OR 3.01, 2.41 and 1.24 respectively) of having a perception of success in health promotion. CONCLUSIONS Health promotion undertaken in newly-opened centres, which involves in particular non-medical staff and, above all, is carried out by professionals satisfied with their habitual work, has a 77% probability of being considered successful by these professionals. These factors greatly facilitate its propagation in Primary Care.</dc:description>
