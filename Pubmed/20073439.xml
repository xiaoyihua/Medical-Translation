<dc:description xml:lang="en">The end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century constitute a breakthrough in medicine. The Industrial Revolution was soon followed by a revolution in medicine characterized by a similar pattern where novel technology was produced. This initiated the transformation of medicine as a science and the establishment of medical specialties as we know them to date. Mexicans physicians must be commended for quickly adapting to this new way of thinking and practicing medicine. Important changes in clinical practice and in the medical community took place and were associated with the creation of several medical institutions. The field of public health grew as a medical concept focused on the individual and the population.</dc:description>
