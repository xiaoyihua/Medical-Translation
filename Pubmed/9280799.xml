<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The role of lipoproteins as markers of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is not well defined. METHODS We measured both lipid and non-lipid risk factors in 51 male patients with angiographically proven PAD and in 56 control subjects. The independent association of risk factors with PAD was evaluated by means of a multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The levels of cholesterol bound to high density lipoprotein (HDLc) and to its subfraction HDL2 were lower and triglycerides were higher in patients than in control subjects (1.0 +/- 0.3 vs 1.2 +/- 0.3, p &lt; 0.003; 0.4 +/- 0.2 vs 0.5 +/- 0.3, p &lt; 0.03; and 1.8 +/- 1.2 vs 1.3 +/- 0.7, p &lt; 0.02, respectively). Total cholesterol and LDLc levels were similar in both groups. In the multiple logistic regression analysis that was done with lipid parameters, a statistically significant association of triglycerides (OR = 1.73; CI95% = 1.06-2.80) and HDLc (OR = 0.15; CI95% = 0.05-0.50) with PAD was observed, while HDL subfractions and apolipoproteins were not significantly associated. In the multiple logistic regression analysis that was done with non-lipid parameters, hypertension (OR = 5.35; CI95% = 1.86-15.4) and smoking (packs-year) (OR = 1.04; CI95% = 1.10-1.06) were the only significantly associated with PAD. When lipid and non-lipid parameters were included in the regression analysis, a statistically significant association between hypertension, smoking and HDLc with PAD was observed. CONCLUSIONS Among lipid risk factors, a low HDLc and high triglycerides, and among non-lipid risk factors hypertension and smoking, are significantly and independently associated with lower limb arteriopathy.</dc:description>
