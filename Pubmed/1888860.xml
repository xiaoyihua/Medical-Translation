<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of the present study was to analyze the content in health education of the patient-physician interview. The study was observational and descriptive. The target population were the patients attending the general practices of the Social Security clinics. With permission of patients and physicians, 53 visits of two general practitioners were recorded on tape. 48 interviews were analyzed with definition of activities (asking, answering, discussing, etc.) and contents (health problems, treatment, health education, etc.). Health education was 10% of the contents, and it was associated with the physician's activity of commenting/instructing and with the patient's activity of commenting/asking.</dc:description>
