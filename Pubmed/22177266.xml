<dc:description xml:lang="en">Systemic amyloidosis comprises a group of diseases that develop as a consequence of an abnormal accumulation of different proteins in several organs, altering their function. Secondary amyloidosis develops after the accumulation of serum amyloid A protein (an acute phase reactant), mainly in the course of chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatologic diseases, familial Mediterranean fever, or tuberculosis. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may also cause secondary amyloidosis. However, little is known about the true prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of amyloidosis among IBD patients. A few studies suggest that amyloidosis is more prevalent in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis, mainly occurring in patients with an extensive, long-lasting, and penetrating disease pattern. In this article we review the available data on secondary amyloidosis and IBD, focusing on prevalence, risk factors, clinical presentation and therapeutic measures.</dc:description>
