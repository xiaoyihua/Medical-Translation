<dc:description xml:lang="en">Gender differences in cardiac autonomic modulation are a controversial topic in several studies. The aim of this study, was to describe and compare the heart rate variability in 30 women and 20 men, Mexicans, between 21 to 36 years of age. A 20 to 24 hours Holter monitoring was performed in all of them. Analysis of time (SDNNN and rMSSD), and frequency domains (HF, LF and LF/HF in absolute values and normalized units) were used. SDNN[IBM1] was significantly higher in men. When adjusted for age, there was a negative correlation in parasympathetic activity indexes (rMSSD and HF) in women. Physical training increased SDNN in men and HF in women. The increased parasympathetic activity found in women with physical training diminishes with age. These results demonstrate differences in cardiovascular autonomic modulation between women and men.</dc:description>
