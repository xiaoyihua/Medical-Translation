<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To assess the efficacy of diode laser photocoagulation for prethreshold retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in zone I. METHODS We considered ROP in zone I that having avascular retina presenting at least 30 degrees of circumferential extent in that zone (centered in the optic disk with a radius of twice the distance from disk to fovea). The avascular retina was photocoagulated with diode laser if ROP showed &lt;plus&gt; disease in junction with any zone of fibrovascular proliferation (prethreshold stage). Noncontiguous applications were used. RESULTS 10 eyes from 5 infants were treated, obtaining a total regression of the disease in 100% of them. All the children were followed for at least 12 months. In the postoperative period a transitory worsening of proliferation was noted in 70% of eyes, sometimes with formation of &lt;vitreous vessels&gt; in the temporal retina (60% of eyes). There were no complications derived from this treatment. CONCLUSIONS Diode laser photocoagulation is highly effective and safe in the treatment of pretheshold ROP in zone I, and we strongly recommend this new strategy for its management.</dc:description>
