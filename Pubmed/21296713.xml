<dc:description xml:lang="en">As patients with intellectual and developmental disability (ID) may be more exposed to unfavorable factors, they are at higher risk of suffering nutritional alterations. Our objective was to determine prevalence of malnutrition in institutionalized patients with ID. An evaluation of the nutritional status through determination of transversal anthropometric parameters of weight (kg) and height (cm) was made on 614 individuals (352 men and 262 women) institutionalized at Colonia Nacional Montes de Oca, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Body mass index and prevalence of underweight, overweight and obesity cases by sex and ID type: mild, moderate and severe intellectual disability were determined. Regardless of sex, prevalence of underweight, overweight and obesity were of 2.9%, 30% and 27.7%, respectively. Regardless of degree of ID, greater prevalence of obesity (41.2%) was found amongst women, while overweight (34.7%) was more frequent amongst men. Taking the degree of ID and regardless of sex, greater prevalence of underweight was observed in severe ID, and overweight and obesity amongst mild ID. No any of the patients with mild ID presented underweight. Taking into account sex and ID, higher prevalence of underweight and overweight were observed amongst men with mild ID, (7% and 38.4%, respectively) and of obesity in women with moderate ID (44%). Results obtained would indicate the importance of caloric intake and energy consumption control in adults with ID, paying particular attention to life conditions and alimentary disorders in terms of the degree of ID and their multiple associated disabilities.</dc:description>
