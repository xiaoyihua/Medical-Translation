<dc:description xml:lang="en">An increase in the frequency of hemodialysis sessions improves control of extracellular volume and blood hypertension and consequently reduces the mortality related to cardiovascular aetiology in hemodialysis patients.We report the evolution of the blood hypertension depending on the need for antihypertensive drugs in a group of 38 prevalent patients that were included in a every-other-day dialysis schedule (EODD), and compare it with the results in two other groups of prevalent patients that were dialyzed in conventional, previously employed schedules without week-end sessions 4 hours x 3 x week and 5 hours x 3 x week. All three groups received hemodialysis treatment for more than 6 months.A 68% (26/38) of the patients received antihypertensive treatment at the beginning the EODD schedule and, after 16 months, only 7.9% (3/38) of them required antihypertensive treatment (p &lt; 0.001) with reduction in two of the three remanent patients; hypertension control in those 25 patients took an average of 100 +/- 15 days. The final frequency of hypertension in EODD was lower (p &lt; 0.002) than the frequency registered in the 84 prevalent patients in 4h x 3 x week schedule, and also lower (p = 0.065) than the frequency of the 56 prevalent patients in 5h x 3 x week schedule. There is a significant difference (p &lt; 0,05) between EODD and 4h x 3 x week schedule as regards average figures of: increase in weight, decrease in dry-weight, blood pressure levels and hypotension incidence. EODD also produced better results than 5h x 3 x week schedule in this regard although statistics did not reflect it. The results using the every-other-day hemodialysis schedule support previous experiences(Lecce, Columbia) which achieved a good control of the dry-weight by means of suppressing the volume overload gained during the weekend and consequently obtaining adequate ultrafiltration rates and high reduction both of the hypertension and of the symptoms of intolerance to hemodialysis, which are so frequent in conventional schedules with 72 hours without hemodialysis sessions.</dc:description>
