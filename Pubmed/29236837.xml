<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To construct and validate a nursing care protocol in anesthesia. METHOD methodological study of face and content validation, judging clarity, relevance, pertinence and comprehensiveness of a care protocol, elaborated from the integrative review of previous literature and based on the conceptual model of assistance perioperative nursing of Castellanos and Jouclas. The protocol was evaluated by five anesthesiologists and nurses from the surgical center. The results were analyzed through the content validity index. RESULTS among the 119 items assessed by experts, 11 (9.2%) instrument items presented content validity index of &lt;80% and were changed. The items with disagreement were related to the selection and availability of materials and equipment, especially before anesthetic induction. The content validity index, obtained for the different items, proposed after the amendments mentioned, ranged from 80 to 100%, in the three periods of anesthesia, indicating the proper validity of the proposed content. CONCLUSION the nursing care protocol in anesthesia was considered valid.</dc:description>
