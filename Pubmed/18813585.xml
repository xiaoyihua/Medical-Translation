<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this paper is to analyze the process of institutionalizing tuberculosis research and teaching in the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the State University of Cordoba. The province of Cordoba, especially the capital and the northwestern region, was considered an area suitable for climatic cure. This caused an important flow of migration of infected people and at the same time an increasing interest of the argentine physicians in studying this disease. The analysis of the different actors that participated in the creation process of teaching institutions in this area will be studied with basis on Bourdieu's concept of 'field'. From this perspective, this paper approaches the stages of the disease, the development of teaching institutions, and the tensions and disagreements that were involved in their constitution.</dc:description>
