<dc:description xml:lang="en">Severe or morbid obesity is one of the 21st century epidemics. Surgery is the most important and cost-effective treatment. Bariatric procedures are becoming very common in our Hospitals. Thromboembolic events such us deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (PE) are the most common medical cause of death after these procedures. Incidence of PE may arise to 3% after surgery and its mortality is about 75%. Prophylactic protocols have not been clearly defined until now. These protocols have to consider special patients, such as morbid obese ones; different kind of procedures, most of the laparoscopic; and patients' comorbidities. By the other hand, treatment for morbid obesity has to be considered by a multidisciplinary approach. Here we present the protocol that has been initiated at our Institution. After a long and high experience in bariatric procedures, we have defined a multidisciplinary protocol to prevent thromboembolic events after surgery where nurses and surgeons play a leading role. The combination of physical, pharmaceutical and educational measures all together are the key for the adequate prevention in these patients.</dc:description>
