<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify the actions, undertaken by nurse managers in a risk management program, considered as best practice. METHOD A case study undertaken in a private hospital in the south of Brazil. A risk manager and nurse managers working in a risk management program participated in this study. The data was collected between May and September 2011 through analysis of documents, semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation. Based on the triangulation, the data was analyzed through practical measures. RESULTS Educational actions, the critical analysis of the context, and the multiple dimensions of the management were evidenced as best practice. CONCLUSIONS The broadening of understanding regarding risk management best practice offers further support for nurse managers to achieve excellence in their actions and thus provide safe and quality care.</dc:description>
