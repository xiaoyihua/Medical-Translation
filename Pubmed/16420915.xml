<dc:description xml:lang="en">The beginning of cervicoscopy dates back to the first laparoscopic parathyroidectomy in 1996. This operation, with its distinct variants, has today become a valid therapeutic option in many well-regarded centers. Later on endoscopic or video-assisted thyroidectomy was introduced, despite the limits imposed by the large size of the gland on its removal. Consequently, this technique is indicated in a small number of patients but both parathyroidectomy and thyroidectomy provide significant advantages over conventional surgery, which have been demonstrated in prospective studies. The main advantages are a better cosmetic outcome and a less distressing postoperative course. Both approaches have been proved to be safe and feasible in any surgical background and their complication rate is similar to that of traditional open surgery of the neck. Videoscopic access to neck lymph nodes (central and lateral compartments) seems to be highly promising, whereas other fields of application such as carotid artery surgery and spine surgery are still the object of experimental studies. Consequently, cervicoscopy should be considered an important surgical tool which already shows great possibilities but which could be further improved.</dc:description>
