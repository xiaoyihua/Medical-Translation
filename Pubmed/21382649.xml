<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to estimate the continuous abstinence rates of varenicline, bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in smoking cessation in 2 Primary Care (PC) External Support Units. DESIGN Observational, multicentre, longitudinal study using a retrospective review of medical records. SETTING Six Primary Care Centres. PARTICIPANTS Patients &gt; 18 years, who began smoking cessation treatment between 1/01/2006 and 1/12/2008 with varenicline, bupropion or NRT were included in the analysis. CONTINUATION: Patient follow-up was conducted from time-baseline (day 1) and assessed at 6 and 12 months. MAIN VARIABLES comorbidities, effectiveness (continuous abstinence) and pharmacological tolerability. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS logistic regression models and Kaplan-Maier survival curves; P&lt;.05. RESULTS A total of 957 smokers treated with NRT (53.0%), bupropion (25.1%) and varenicline (21.9%) were included in the analysis. Mean age: 47.6 (11.3) years; 58.6% men. 32.0% of smokers attended due to physical dependence. Average duration of smoking: 19.5 (6.7) years. At 6 months, 61.2% (95% CI: 54.6-67.8%) of participants in the varenicline group continuously abstained from smoking compared with 56.9% (95% CI: 50.6-63.2%) in the bupropion group, and 52.3% (95% CI: 48.0-56.6%) in the NRT group; P=.003. At 12 months, the rate of continuous abstinence was 57.4% (95% CI: 50.7-64.1%) in the varenicline group compared with 52.9% (95% CI: 46.6-59.2%) in the bupropion group and 47.1% (95% CI: 42.8-51.4%) in the NRT group; P=.002. CONCLUSION One year-follow up results suggest that varenicline is an appropriate alternative compared with bupropion and NRT on smoking cessation in the PC setting.</dc:description>
