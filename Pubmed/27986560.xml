<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common arrhythmias, and its prevalence increase with age. It is associated with high risk of stroke. The prevention of such thromboembolism is done with oral anticoagulants, which in our country seem to be underused. CARMEN-AF registry aims primarily to determine the current status of thromboprophylaxis of non-valvular AF in Mexico. A secondary objective is to know the morbidity and mortality associated with non-valvular AF in at least one year of follow-up. METHODS CARMEN-AF registry is an observational, longitudinal, multicenter, and national survey about the use of oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular AF. Patients 18years old or older, diagnosed with AF during the last 6months, and with at least one risk factor of thromboembolism based in the CHA2DS2-Vasc score are being selected. Demographic and clinical data will be collected during the visits to their usual clinic with a follow-up of 2years. The recruitment began on September 19, 2014, and the inclusion of the last patient is expected on September 18, 2016. According to the reported incidence of AF globally and taking into account the total Mexican population, the inclusion of 1,200 patients is estimated. CONCLUSIONS The Atrial Fibrillation and Embolic Risk Registry (CARMEN-AF) will reveal the current status of thromboprophylaxis in patients with non-valvular AF, and will allow to get an overview of the national and international clinical practice guidelines accomplishment in this area.</dc:description>
