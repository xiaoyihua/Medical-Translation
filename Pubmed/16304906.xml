<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The TVT system is the most common surgical technique of female stress urinary incontinence, because of the simplicity. good clinical results and rare complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS From april, 1999 to march. 2004, it has been done in our department 100 TVT systems with the revision of the result over the six following months. The average follow-up rate was 10.36 months (R: 1-54 months) and looses mean the 11% of the cases. All the patients presented stress incontinence and their average age was 56.6 years old (30-80). The 12% of the cases have been previously operated of urinary incontinence. 21 patients presented previous surgery of pelvic floor. In the 17% of the cases, TVT systems was associated to another surgical technique: 15% of them was operated of cystocele, 1% of them had surgical correction of rectocele, 1% of them had a strong surgery of pelvic floor, that included TVT system, correction of pelvic floor and hysterectomy. RESULTS We obtained 65% of successful cases, defined as objective confirmation of absence of looses from the observer and the subjective reference of the patient: 17% of clear improvement (clear decrease of looses from the patient and subjective improvement) and 7% of failure of the technique. The total percentage of appearance of novo post-surgery urgency is 9%. There were complications in the 12% of the cases: there were three cases of bladder perforation, two of them intra-operative and one of them deferred and associated to an infection of surgical wound; another three cases of residue in the immediate post-operative that were resolved with bladder catheterization: one case of acute urinary retention that was treated with bladder catheterization with suprapubic cistostomy: one case of chemical peritonitis corrected with a conservative treatment; two cases of vaginal extrusion of sling, which were resolved with the section of the outer sling; one patient presented a hipogastric hematoma resolved with conservative measures: and one patient presented pelvic discomfort with spontaneous resolution. CONCLUSIONS We consider the TVT system as an effective surgical technique in the treatment of the female stress urinary incontinence. It is a simple technique with a short stay in the hospital and rare complications.</dc:description>
