<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To evaluate the participation of Spanish anesthesiology departments in the management of patients hospitalized for spontaneous aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. MATERIAL AND METHODS Chiefs of anesthesiology departments of hospitals listed in the Spanish National Catalog of Hospitals of the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs were sent a questionnaire with 30 items covering protocols for the management of patients with spontaneous aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Items asked about the participation of anesthesiologists during both admission and the perioperative period. RESULTS The questionnaire was sent to 132 hospitals, of which 18 (13.6%) responded. Forty-six percent of anesthesiology departments do not participate in the initial resuscitation. Only 4 reported having a protocol for treating these patients. The initial diagnosis was reportedly made by cranial computed tomography in all cases. Endovascular treatment was the most common procedure reported (66%) and it was given within the first 48 hours (66%). Basic monitoring was used more than nervous system monitoring. Total intravenous anesthesia was used for craniotomy in 53% of the hospitals and for endovascular treatment in 64%. Complications reported most often were vasospasm (100%) and hydrocephalus (69%). CONCLUSIONS Even though few questionnaires were returned, the results reveal scarce use of protocols for the treatment of spontaneous aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage by anesthesiologists. It was also evident that the participation of anesthesiology department staff in the treatment of this condition takes place almost exclusively in the intraoperative period and that the use of nervous system monitoring is scarce. Endovascular treatment is increasing in our practice settings.</dc:description>
