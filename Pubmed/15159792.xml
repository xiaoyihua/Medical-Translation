<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyze the effect of different therapies -surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (temozolomide)- on the survival of various groups of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). METHOD The overall survival of a total of 85 patients with histopathological diagnosis of GBM was analyzed (descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier). Patients were divided into 4 treatment groups: group 1 (n=12), untreated patients (" no treatment" option was chosen by the family); group 2 (n=22), patients undergoing surgery only (retrospective series from the 1980s); group 3 (n=24), patients undergoing surgery + standard radiotherapy (control group, partially effective treatment); group 4 (n=27), patients undergoing surgery + radiotherapy + chemotherapy (temozolomide [TMZ]) (current study group). RESULTS Mean age (one-way ANOVA) showed no significant difference between the groups. Mean/median survival (weeks) was as follows: group 1, 18/16; group 2, 23/14; group 3, 48/42; group 4, 70/64. The Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded the following 50% survival cutoffs (weeks): group 1, 16.00; group 2, 14.29; group 3, 42.00; group 4, 64.43. This demonstrated a significant difference when radiotherapy (group 3) was added to surgery (group 2) or no treatment (group 1), and a significant difference (p &lt; 0.001) in survival when TMZ (group 4) was added to the so far considered as being the standard treatment (group 3: surgery + radiotherapy). CONCLUSIONS Surgery alone does not result in a higher survival rate for GBM patients. However, surgery allows to establish a histopathological diagnosis, to improve signs and symptoms which are attributable to intracranial hypertension or tumour topography, and to reduce the number of target cells for adjunctive therapies. Radiotherapy improves survival and TMZ chemotherapy that is given after radiotherapy adds further survival benefit for patients.</dc:description>
