<dc:description xml:lang="en">In recent years there has been an increasing social concern in Spain about electromagnetic fields (EMF) and their effects on human health. Some groups have expressed their opposition to antennas of base stations and high voltage power transmission lines. The present article discusses the current status of health protection against EMF in Spain. The assessment is based on the background and justification of the European Union Council Recommendation of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general population to electromagnetic fields (0 Hz to 300 GHz), the Spanish Royal Decree 1006/2001 on health protection against radioelectric emissions and the most relevant epidemiological studies. The need for implementation of a comprehensive approach based on risk assessment and the precaution principle is emphasized. In order to be coherent with the Council Recommendation and Spanish EMF legislation some strategies for health protection are proposed.</dc:description>
