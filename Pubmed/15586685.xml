<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study was performed to assess both risk and protective factors associated with iron deficiency anemia in 130 infants with age below 24 months, with low socio-economic status and followed since their births by a primary health care program in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Growth, morbidity and dietary factors were analysed as well as hemoglobin levels (Hb) at regular intervals (6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months). The portable Hemocue photometer was employed to measure hemoglobin levels and anemia was considered when Hb values were below 11 g/dL. Simple logistic regression was used with socio-economic variables, age group, nutritional status, morbidity, breastfeeding and food intake. Risk factors for anemia in the studied group were intake of cow's milk at 4 months and who has 3 or more old brothers (OR approximately = 2). The protective factors for anemia were age between 18 and 24 months and intake of infant formula, vitamin C, meat and beans at 6 months (OR approximately = 0.5). The prevention of iron deficiency anemia includes encouraging healthy feeding practices starting at 6 months of life.</dc:description>
