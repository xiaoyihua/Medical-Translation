<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To characterize the most frequently found radiological findings in intestinal anisakiasis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The medical records of 14 patients diagnosed with intestinal anisakiasis between 2000 and 2003 in the Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa in Zaragoza (Spain) were retrospectively reviewed. The imaging tests and immunological laboratory tests performed in these patients were evaluated. RESULTS The most frequent reason for seeking medical assistance was right iliac fossa pain. Radiological findings of an inflammatory intestinal process were observed in 60 % of the patients. Seventy-five percent of the patients had eaten raw or insufficiently cooked fish and had eosinophilia; of these 80 % had elevated specific IgE levels. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of anisakiasis is increasing and consequently knowledge of its most characteristic clinical, radiological and laboratory manifestations is important. The most frequently affected segment of the digestive tract is the ileum. Many patients have symptoms of acute abdomen, mimicking appendicitis or peritonitis. Anisakiasis is a self-limiting process that usually resolves in 1-2 weeks. Consequently, a conservative attitude is advisable to avoid unnecessary surgery.</dc:description>
