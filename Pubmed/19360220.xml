<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Determining adolescents' level of knowledge (LK) about HIV/AIDS using descriptive investigation. METHODS The population was represented by 329 students from the 4th and 5th grades from two public high-schools. A non-probabilistic sample was formed by 208 available students from the high schools and to whom a questionnaire concerning HIV/AIDS, prevention and transmission mode was applied. RESULTS The participants' mean age was 15.9 +/- 1.24; 57.2 % were female. 24.5 % reported a 'good' LK, 67.3 % 'fair' LK and 8.2 % 'deficient' LK. LK concerning preventative measures showed that 25.5 % knew them. 95.7 % answered correctly that, 'HIV/AIDS can be transmitted by unprotected sexual relations,' and 41.8 % answered incorrectly that, 'There is no way of protecting against HIV.' CONCLUSIONS The students generally had fair LK. Educational strategies must be implemented to improve knowledge about the disease, its consequences and preventative measures for protecting this group at risk.</dc:description>
