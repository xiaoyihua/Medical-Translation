<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Up-date in the treatment of rapid cycling and other resistant bipolar disorders. METHODS A Medline research of the literature was performed in several databases as Pub-Med, Cochrane and Embasse, from 1998 to December 2001. We have also reviewed bibliography supplied by different laboratories and several monographies. RESULTS 30 articles were selected: 11 reviews, 17 openlabeled studies and 2 articles on general recommendations. From the 17 open-labaled studies, 10 were on topiramate (25 to 400 mg/day) as a coadjuvant of another stabilizer. Improvement ranged from 40 to 70%; 4 adding gabapentin to the previous treatment, at the dosage of 60 to 5,600 mg/day, 27 and 92% showed improvement; 1 with mexiletine (200 to 1,200 mg/day) in which 46% were full responders, 15% partial responders and 38 % had no response, 100% response in manic or mixed and 38 % in depressed patients; and 2 with lamotrigine (50 to 500 mg/day) in which 52 to 80 % showed improvement. With risperidone at the dosage of 2-3 mg/day as coadjuvant, improvement was seen in 62 %. Olanzapine had direct short-term antimanic effects, with 49 % improvement in single drug therapy and 57 % as coadjuvant. CONCLUSIONS More double-blind studies are necessary to assess efficacy in monotherapy or as coadjuvants, in short-term or even in monotherapy, and to compare the different treatments with each other as well as with the conventional treatment. The authors agree in pointing out the efficacy of gabapentin and topiramate associated to another stabilizer, and also of lamotrigine in depressed phases.</dc:description>
