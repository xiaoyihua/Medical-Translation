<dc:description xml:lang="es">Introduction and objectives. Encouraging results at long-term follow-up have been reported from non-randomized registries and randomized trials following percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent implantation for unprotected left main stenosis. However, information on very long-term (&gt;5-year) outcomes is limited. The aim of this study was to assess the very long-term outcomes (6-years) following drug-eluting stent implantation for left main disease. Methods. All consecutive patients with unprotected left main stenosis electively treated with drug-eluting stent implantation, between March 2002 and May 2005, were analyzed according to the location of the left main lesion (distal bifurcation vs ostial/body). Results. The study included 149 patients: 113 with distal bifurcation and 36 with ostial/body lesion. Triple-vessel disease was significantly higher in the distal than in the ostial/body group (52.2% vs 33.2%, P=.05). At 6-years of follow-up, the cumulative major adverse cardiovascular event rate was 41.6% (45.1% distal vs 30.6% ostial/body, P=0.1), including 18.8% any death (22.1% distal vs 8.3% ostial/body, P=.08), 3.4% myocardial infarction (3.5% distal vs 2.8% ostial/body, P=1), and 15.4% target lesion revascularization (18.6% distal vs 5.6% ostial/body, P=.06). The composite of cardiac death and myocardial infarction was 10.7% (13.3% distal vs 2.8% ostial/body, P=.1) while the definite/probable stent thrombosis rate was 1.4% (all in the distal group). Conclusions. At 6-year clinical follow-up, percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent implantation for unprotected left main disease was associated with acceptable rates of cardiac death, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis. Favorable long-term outcomes in ostial/body lesions compared to distal bifurcation lesions were confirmed at long-term clinical follow-up(AU)</dc:description>
