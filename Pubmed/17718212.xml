<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report the case of a patient with the diagnosis of locally advanced renal carcinoma. METHODS We present in the case in a clear and well illustrated way (pictures). We report the case of a female patient with a very big renal carcinoma, with local extension, who underwent nephrectomy through a lumbar approach and received chemotherapy and immunotherapy. RESULTS Despite radical surgery, chemotherapy and immunotherapy the tumor had rapid evolution locally and systemically, as a demonstration of its high aggressiveness. CONCLUSIONS Renal carcinoma is considered the tumor with a high tendency to have metastases. The prognosis depends on size, stage and grade, determining factors for patient survival. Although there are new therapeutic options (immunologic), surgery continues being the main therapeutic tool. Continuous regular follow-up enable us detection and timely treatment of any event (local or systemic recurrence).</dc:description>
