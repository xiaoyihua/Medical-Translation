<dc:description xml:lang="en">Focal motor seizures are common in nonketotic hyperglycemia but occipital seizures as the initial symptom of hyperglycemia are exceptional. Sporadic electroencephalographic description has rarely been reported. A 56-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of intermittent, 30-minute episodes of flashing lights (blue-yellow color), 3-4 times per day in his left lower temporal visual field. His past medical history was significant for hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. The results of the ophthalmology examination were normal. When asked, the patient reported polyuria, polydipsia and weight gain for the previous 4 months. His general state was good and no other neurological symptoms were present. Among the laboratory tests, non-ketonic hyperglycemia of 339 mg/dl and mild plasma hyperosmolarity of 302 mOsm/kg were found. The results of visual campimetry were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed minimal alterations unrelated to the visual symptoms. An electrographic seizure in the right occipital region associated with visual symptoms was recorded. The patient was treated with hydration and insulin and was completely asymptomatic after 48 hours.</dc:description>
