<dc:description xml:lang="en">The natural history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in children may lead to hepatic cirrhosis and hepatoma. Since the antiviral effect of recombinant interferon alpha (rIFN-alpha) in the treatment of chronic hepatitis in adults has been proven, a controlled study of therapy using rIFN-alpha in children chronic hepatitis due to HBV has been carried out. Twenty-four children (4-14 years old) HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV-DNA positive were randomly allocated to one of three groups: 1) n = 8, control; II) n = 8, who received 10 MU/m2 of rIFN-alpha (Boehringer Ingelheim)/m2 body surface, I.M., twice a week for six months and III) n = 8, treated with 7.5 MU/m2 under the same conditions. No basal differences between the three groups were observed. No intolerable toxicity was observed and all children completed the treatment period. At the end of the therapy, 5 patients in groups I (1 case), II (2 cases) and III (2 cases), had lost circulating HBV-DNA. With respect to HBeAg, 3 patients (one from each group) were negative by the sixth month, developing anti-HBe. Decreases in ALT levels among rIFN-alpha responder patients were observed, while no changes occurred in the rest. A significant decrease in the percentage of HBcAg positive hepatocytes was detected only among treated patients, when comparing the basal and final liver biopsies. In summary, rIFN-alpha therapy in children is well tolerated. In addition, these results suggest that rIFN-alpha has an antiviral effect.</dc:description>
