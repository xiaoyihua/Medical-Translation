<dc:description xml:lang="en">The medical records of children who died from asthmatiform syndrome at Hospital de Pediatría del Centro Médico Nacional, during 1963 through 1980. were examined. There were sixteen asthmatic deaths; out of these, ten were males and six females; 88% occurred before the age of five years. Half of the deaths occurred during the first asthmatiform attack. In 69%, an upper respiratory tract infection was the precipitating factor and in 31%, bronchopneumonia was associated. There were cardiac failures in 88%. A poor medical management was the main factor in about 66%. The mortality rate was 0.5%. The significance of the clinical course is discussed and a program for treatment outlined.</dc:description>
