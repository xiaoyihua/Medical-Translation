<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe present day dietary habits, and how and why they may have changed over the lifetimes. DESIGN Cross-sectional. PARTICIPANTS 1037 lower middle-class women, resident in Alcobendas (Autonomous Community of Madrid, Spain), and born between 1933 and 1953. All the women participating in a Women Health Program organized by the Alcobendas Municipality. RESULTS 21.9% of the women followed some special type of diet, of whom 53.74% did so because of illness and 28.63% did so in order to slim. The type of diet adopted differed significantly according to age (chi 2 = 11.52, d.f. = 3, p = 0.009). Women under 55 years of age chose their diets fundamentally in order to slim, while the over-55s followed special diets (e.g., low cholesterol, salt-free, and diabetic) for reasons of health. 48.78% of the women in the sample had changed their dietary habits for distinct reasons: migration, marriage, illness, menopause, weight gain, etc. CONCLUSIONS The change in dietary habits has followed the pattern observed in other industrialized countries, including Spain. Within this general pattern there has also be a trend towards a decrease in the consumption of proteins and simple carbohydrates associated with age and nutrition-related diseases.</dc:description>
