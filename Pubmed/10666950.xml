<dc:description xml:lang="en">Morphometry is a method to detect changes in a variety of tissues through quantitative elements. The purpose of this study was to examine several nuclear morphologic characteristics in normal and neoplastic mammary ductal cells using a multivariable method and expression of estrogen receptors by immunohistochemical techniques. A total of 1879 nuclei were examined by a computerized program, following the detection of estrogen receptors. Nuclear area, perimeter, diameter, maximal and minimal radio were obtained in 439 normal ductal nuclei. The mean nuclear area was 14.45 with a range between 10.88 and 17.90. Variables showed adequate statistical correlation (r &gt; 0.5). A total of 1440 neoplastic nuclei were classified as grades I, II and III, and a statistical significative difference was found between these three groups. We conclude that the nuclear area is a reliable variable for statistical correlation being the ductal nuclei anisotropic objects.</dc:description>
