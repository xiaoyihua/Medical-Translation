<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Multiport laparoscopic surgery in colon pathology has been demonstrated as a safe and effective technique. Interest in reducing aggressiveness has led to other procedures being described, such as SILS. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate feasibility and security of SILS technique in colonic surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS A meta-analysis of twenty 7 observational studies and one prospective randomized trial has been conducted by the use of random-effects models. RESULTS A total amount of 2870 procedures was analyzed: 1119 SILS and 1751 MLC. We did not find statistically significant differences between SILS and MLC in age (WMD 0.28 [-1.13, 1.68]; P=.70), BMI (WMD -0.63 [-1.34, 0.08]; P=.08), ASA score (WMD -0.02 [-0.08, 0.04]; P=.51), length of incision (WMD -1.90 [-3.95, 0.14]; P=.07), operating time (WMD -2.69 (-18.33, 12.95]; P=.74), complications (OR=0.89 [0.69, 1.15]; P=.37), conversion to laparotomy (OR=0.59 [0.33, 1.04]; P=.07), mortality (OR=0.91 [0.36, 2.34]; P=.85) or number of lymph nodes harvested (WMD 0.13 [-2.52, 2.78]; P=.92). The blood loss was significantly lower in the SILS group (WMD -42.68 [-76.79, -8.57]; P=.01) and the length of hospital stay was also significantly lower in the SILS group (WMD -0.73 [-1.18, -0.28]; P=.001). CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic colectomy is a safe and effective technique with additional subtle benefits compared to multiport laparoscopic colectomy. However, further prospective randomized studies are needed before single-port colectomy can be considered an alternative to multiport laparoscopic surgery of the colon.</dc:description>
