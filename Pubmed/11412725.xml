<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Multiple sclerosis (MS) usually follows a relapsing-remitting course and attacks multiple areas of the central nervous system (CNS). Certain rheumatic diseases, including Sjögren's syndrome (SS), can present with a similar clinical picture. RESULTS Two patients out 67 of 100 with MS exhibited xerophthalmia and xerostomia and positive Ro antibodies, thus fulfilling 55 diagnostic criteria. Case 1. A 62-year-old woman developed several episodes of numbress and weakness in her left extremity and ataxia. MRI demonstrated a high-intensity areas in periventricular white matter. Initial laboratory studies failure to demonstrate antinuclear antibodies. Xerostomia and xerophthalmia were apparent. Follow-up laboratory examinations showed elevated ANA, Anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Case 2. A 58-year-old woman was diagnosed as having MS at the age of 53 years. Several high-signal foci on MRI were demonstrated in the white matter. Initial serum findings including autoantibodies were unremarkable. Sicca syndrome was present. Laboratory investigations included elevated anti-SSA, anti-SSARo52 and ANA while anti-SSB was within normal limits. DISCUSSION Primary SS is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. The CNS symptoms are present in 20-25% of the patients with SS. Some patients have a relapsing-remitting course mimicking MS. Focal brain lesions in SS can occur in the cerebral white matter. The features of our patients sufficiently mimicked those of MS and this disorder was the diagnosis in each patient at the time of initial evaluation. SS should be considered in th</dc:description>
