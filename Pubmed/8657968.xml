<dc:description xml:lang="en">One hundred forty patients treated for intestinal complications of pelvic irradiation are presented. The most common clinical expression was radiation rectitis, complicated with rectovaginal fistulas in 58% of cases. These patients were subjected to Parks procedure for fistula repair with satisfactory results. Half the operated patients remained with an ostomy as a definitive sequel and overall perioperative mortality in these patients was 10%. Radiation enteritis has a high operative mortality due to delays in diagnosis and to severe septic complications. It must be suspected in irradiated patients presenting with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Urological complications and involvement of several intestinal segments are bad prognostic factors. Resections and anastomoses with undamaged segments are the safest surgical procedures. Improvements of radiation techniques and the use of a reabsorbable mesh to seal the pelvis during radiation therapy are adequate preventive measures.</dc:description>
