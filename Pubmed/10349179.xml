<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The high costs of adequate pharmacological treatment for Parkinson disease preclude the universal access of patients to this medication. AIM To assess the accessibility to pharmacological treatment of Chilean patients with Parkinson disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS An inquiry about socioeconomic stratification, medical controls, disease features and costs of pharmacological therapy, was applied to 95 patients (56 male, aged 32 to 89 years old) attending the Chilean League Against Parkinson Disease. RESULTS Among studied patients, the disease had a mean duration of 7.9 +/- 6 years. There was a direct relationship between family income, the frequency of visits to physicians and the dose and cost of pharmacological therapy. CONCLUSIONS The accessibility to pharmacological therapy among patients with Parkinson disease, depends on their socioeconomic level. Measures to correct this situation and improve the quality of life of these patients should be undertaken by health services.</dc:description>
