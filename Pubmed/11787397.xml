<dc:description xml:lang="en">The spinal column has been considered ideal for guided surgery due to its stable anatomical structure and notable reference points which are perfectly distinguishable both in computer tomography (C.T.) images and in the surgical field. Our main objective was to apply this technique to the conventional transpedicular fusion surgery. During the last year (1999), 13 males and 26 females, with an average of 47.1, + 14.1 years were operated because of degenerative discopathy (9 cases) degenerative discopathy associated to listhesis (7 cases) and spinal canal stenosis (8 cases). All of them were operated according to a preestablished protocol using the Brain Lab Image Guided System. The preestablished protocol could not be applied in 3 patients. Of the 36 patients, only in 22 cases (61%), a properly navigation was obtained. In these cases 116 screws were used: 108 (93%) strictly intrapediculars. In the other 14 patients, without Guided Surgery, it was used 76 screws: 65 (86%) were strictly intrapediculars. In our opinion Guided Spine Surgery, offers an accuracy and reliability to reduce the margin of error in the Transpedicular location of the Spine Fusion Systems.</dc:description>
