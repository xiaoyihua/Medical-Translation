<dc:description xml:lang="en">Natural rubber latex has been in widespread use for over a century. Reports of immediate hypersensitivity to latex have increased dramatically since the first case was reported in 1979, specially in persons with cumulative latex exposure. A 13 year old male was referred to our office. He had been wearing orthodontic rubber bands for two years. The previous year he started having itchy, red and watery eyes, with sneezing and runny nose when he was exposed to rubber products. Then he developed oral edema and lip ulcers. Finally, he experienced cough, wheezing, chest tightness and dyspnea. The patient had no history of undergoing surgery, and his mother denied pacifier use. He had no history of fruit and vegetables allergy. Physical examination revealed conjunctival hyperemia, with fine papillary response in the upper tarsal plate, hyaline rhinorrhea, turbinate hypertrophy and perioral ulcers. Skin prick test were positive for latex and Quercus albus. Patch test with latex glove was negative, but positive with rubber tourniquet. Total IgE was 365 UI/mL. Latex-specific IgE testing confirmed the diagnosis. Spirometric values were normal. He started rush sublingual immunotherapy with latex extract. When he had finished, he traveled abroad. At immigration the inspectors examined him with latex gloves. Immediately he developed anaphylaxis, needing urgent medical attention. Although the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy for latex allergy has been demonstrated, the most effective strategy is complete avoidance of latex-containing products. World Public Health Services must promote the use of synthetic elastomer gloves in airports worldwide.</dc:description>
