<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Treatment with antiepileptic drugs in patients with medical conditions, old age or pregnancy is associated with concomitant pathology and the specific physiopathological changes of age or pregnancy. DEVELOPMENT The difficulties of treatment in special conditions are related to changes in the pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs, interaction with other medication and with concomitant treatment with drugs which may potentially cause convulsions. Also, the occurrence of a particular disorder or of pregnancy may lead to changes in the frequency of crises. Besides this, the side-effects of antiepileptic drugs may be more marked or more frequent in patients with several other conditions or in the elderly. CONCLUSION The treatment of epilepsy in patients with associated medical disorders, old age or pregnancy requires knowledge of the behaviour of antiepileptic drugs and the physiopathology of these conditions.</dc:description>
