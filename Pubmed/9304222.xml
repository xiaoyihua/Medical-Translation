<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE A prospective study of the demographic and epidemiologic characteristics of patients with liver cirrhosis at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara within a period of one year. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 157 patients (48 women, and 109 men) from the Departments of Internal Medicine, Gastroenterology and Liver Clinic were studied. Diagnosis of liver cirrhosis had been previously established based on clinical, biochemical or histopathological information. Additionally, a questionnaire specialized on liver diseases was applied to all patients. RESULTS Alcoholism was the main cause for cirrhosis (38% in women and 95% in men) followed by viral etiology. The alcoholic beverages consumed with greater frequency were tequila and 96 degrees G.L. alcohol. Women were in the Child-Pugh's "B" class while men were in class "C". Complications were mostly gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Differences between sexes were observed for various characteristics. CONCLUSIONS Alcoholism was by far the most frequent cause of liver cirrhosis. The second cause, in women, was of viral origin (16.7%). A national committee of vigilance of liver diseases is proposed to generate more complete and detailed information on the epidemiology of liver cirrhosis.</dc:description>
