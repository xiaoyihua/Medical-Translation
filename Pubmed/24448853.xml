<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In 2005, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was included in a universal health plan (GES) to reduce inequity in care and optimize its diagnosis and treatment. AIM To evaluate the effect of GES in risk factor control and therapeutic management among patients with AMI. MATERIAL AND METHODS A survey was conducted in 2008-2009 in six public hospitals. Patients were identified from a hospital based registry of AMI and evaluated one year later with laboratory tests and an interview. RESULTS The registry enrolled 534 patients with ST and non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Of these, 416 patients aged 63 ± 12 years (25% women) were evaluated one year later. Eighty three percent were evaluated by a cardiologist and 37% by a general practitioner. Twenty two percent were evaluated by a nurse and 22% by a nutritionist. At the moment of the interview, 9% smoked, 78% were overweight or obese, 24% performed moderate or vigorous physical activity ≥ 150 min/week, 60% had systolic pressure &gt; 130 mmHg and 63% a diastolic pressure &gt; 80 mmHg. In 30%, LDL cholesterol was &gt; 100 mg/dl and in 43%, triglycerides were &gt; 150 mm/dl. Twenty two percent were diabetic and among them, 52% had a glycosylated hemoglobin &gt; 7%. Forty five percent of non-diabetic patients had a fasting glucose &gt; 100 mg/dl. Ninety three percent were in treatment with aspirin, 86% with statins, 66% with b-blockers, and 73% with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and 20% with clopidogrel. CONCLUSIONS Despite the high proportion of patients in treatment with evidence-based therapy, many do not achieve the targets for risk factor control with the new health care model.</dc:description>
