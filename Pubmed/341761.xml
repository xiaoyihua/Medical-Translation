<dc:description xml:lang="en">A series of 53 children admitted during a 20-month period to the Hospital for burns due to hot liquids is reported 88.6% were under three. 34 children were seen during spring and fall months. Most patients were recently burnt and in the majority of cases (27) burned surface was under 20%. l.v. fluids were used in 17 cases and management protocol included: Closed local care after the 3rd or 4th day with nitrofurazone cream and antibiotics only in selected cases. Mortality was 5.5% (three cases) due to acute renal failure at the 3rd, 5th and 10th days. 24.5% had a local infection in the first two weeks, gram negative bacteria being present in 75% of these cases. 33.2% (18 cases) required grafting. This was more frequently needed in boiling oil burns. In seven cases, grafting was necessary before the 30th day (average 23.2 days), and in the remaining patients after this time (average 42.1 days). Authors advise a strict prevention of acute rend failure and early grafting.</dc:description>
