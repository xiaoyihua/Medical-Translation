<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Nowadays, it is much more common in end stage renal disease patients with vascular grafts, to be kidney transplant candidates. We expose our experience in five cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS Of all 1,483 kidneys transplanted in our center, 5 recipients had a previous aortobifemoral bypass (2 due to abdominal aortic aneurysm, and 3 due to vascular occlusive disease). We review the clinical features, outcome and complications in these patients. RESULTS The vascular surgery was done 6 months to 16 years prior to transplantation. The renal transplant was done in iliac fossa with arterial anastomosis to the vascular graft. Surgical complications were: 1 renal artery thrombosis that was treated with thrombectomy, and 1 stricture at the ureterovesical junction. 2 patients dead at 6 months and 7 years with a functioning allograft and 3 patients live with functional allograft at 7 months, 3 years and 7 years. CONCLUSION Kidney transplantation may be successful in selected patients with aortobifemoral bypass.</dc:description>
