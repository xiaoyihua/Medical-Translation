<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ascaridiasis, as shown by Stoll is one of the most frequent parasitosis the world over; in our country is very frequent and its incidence is greater in the tropical areas. The emigration of the ascari to the biliary tract is cause of obstructive jaundice and acute cholecystitis. The clinical picture sometimes is taken for the one produced by biliary lythiasis. In the two cases presented the diagnosis was made during the trans-operative period. Ascaridiasis of the biliary ducts is more frequent in women; as judged by our cases and the cases reported by López Domínguez, Laviada and Tovia. The surgical treatment in our cases was cholecystectomy and cholocostomy with good results. This entity should be kept in mind as cause of obstructive jaundice or acute cholecystitis.</dc:description>
