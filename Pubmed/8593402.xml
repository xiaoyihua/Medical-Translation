<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objectives of this study were to examine the humoral immune response of sheep to experimental infection with an isolate of rabies virus from a fox, to analyse the efficacy of vaccination as a method of post-infection treatment, and to find a suitable animal model to evaluate new procedures for human vaccination following infection. A total of 47 sheep were used. Initially, 26 sheep received an intramuscular injection of a suspension of virus (titre: 10(6.8) 50% lethal dose for mice by the intracerebral route). Half of the sheep were subsequently treated using a vaccine on the day of infection and at 3, 7, 14 and 30 days post-infection. The remaining half comprised the unvaccinated controls. This vaccination protected seven of thirteen sheep, while nine of the thirteen controls died. Subsequently, 21 sheep were inoculated under the same conditions as in the previous trial. The animals were divided into three groups of seven animals each. The first group was vaccinated in the same way as described above. The second group received an injection of anti-rabies immunoglobulin of human origin (26.3 IU/kg of body weight), followed by the course of vaccine treatment 24 hours later. The remaining group acted as unvaccinated controls. Of the seven sheep given vaccine alone, four were protected, while all seven animals given immunoglobulin and vaccine were protected. Six of the seven untreated controls died. In this study, no apparently-healthy carriers of rabies virus were created by any of the treatments used, nor was there any shortening of the incubation periods. Additional observations were made concerning incubation periods and the course of the disease, as well as symptoms, lesions and the presence of rabies virus in various nerve centres and salivary glands of the experimental sheep.</dc:description>
