<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin disease that may be associated with articular manifestations, and the most common clinical presentation is the variety "in plaques". In Mexico, in the Centro Dermatológico Pascua, it is the eighth leading cause of consultation. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic process of patients in a reference center for diseases of the skin. METHODS Performing an analytical cross-sectional study that included 100 patients where the diagnostic process was questioned, clinimetric scales were applied and evaluated anthropometric. RESULTS It was found that 70% of patients had taken over a month to get medical care (median: 3 months; IQR: 11 months), having consulted in 61% to a general physician as a doctor of first contact and 89% being diagnosed by a dermatologist. Eighty-eight percent of the patients were overweight or obese. We found as a factor of delay, a partnership with the variable of having an Institutional Medical Service (p = 0.019; U = 695.5). CONCLUSION it is necessary to design a system to shorten the diagnostic process, not only in psoriasis, in addition to emphasizing dermatological education.</dc:description>
