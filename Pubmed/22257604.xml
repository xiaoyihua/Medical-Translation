<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Psychometric validation of the Spanish version of the Treatment Benefit Scale (TBS) scale for assessing the patient's treatment benefit on symptoms associated to overactive bladder. PATIENTS AND METHODS The Spanish version of the TBS was administered in the final visit of a prospective observational clinic study, after 3 months of a clinical intervention. Overactive bladder patients, above 18 years old, of both genders, with an OAB-V8 score ≥8, and able to understand health questionnaires in Spanish were recruited. RESULTS A total of 246 patients (57.7 years, 76% women) were included. The scale was not completed by 1.7% of patients. Extreme improvement was experienced by 30% of patients, 58% improved, 11% did not change, and 2% worsened after medical intervention. The TBS significantly correlated with the clinical criterion of change; (r=0.743; P&lt;.001). A linear association was observed with changes in both OABq-SF scale domains; severity: F(linear)=33.89, P&lt;.001 and health related quality of life: F(linear)=41.69, P&lt;.001. The TBS was able to distinguish between groups of patients by severity and quality of life, F=11.17, P&lt;.001 and F=13.95, P&lt;.001. CONCLUSION The Spanish version of the TBS scale has shown good validity psychometric properties in Spanish overactive bladder patients, supporting its use in routinely clinical practice for assessing subjective outputs related to overactive bladder treatment.</dc:description>
