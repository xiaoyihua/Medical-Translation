<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The polythetic method used in the DSM is the one proposed traditionally for the diagnosis of Attention Disorders with or without Hyperactivity (ADHD). However, it is possible that the approach which aggregates any combination of 6 items won't be the optimal method to establish a diagnosis of ADHD, and that the different combinations may not be the same as regards to their ability to predict ADHD. AIM Determine which combinations of items of DuPaul's inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity scales (from parent and teacher versions), are the most effective to predict or rule out a diagnosis of ADHD. RESULTS Not every combination of items from parents and teachers obtained the same predictive value. All of them offered high levels of specificity, but had low sensivity; that is to say, the combinations were more effective and reliable for ruling out the disorder than predicting it. CONCLUSIONS Data show that not every combination of ADHD items has the same predictive value and, therefore, the well-known polythetic method is disputable. The highest predictive value combinations, limitations of the study, and future lines of investigation are analyzed.</dc:description>
