<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present twelve cases of Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia (PCP) hospitalized at the Internal Medicine Service of the Hospital Clínico de Valencia between 1989 and 1990. All patients were infected by HIV-1, with ages between 25 and 32 years, with circulating CD4 lymphocytes lower than 25% or 200 cells per cubic millimeter and with positive p24 antigen. Ten of them were parenterally drug addicts and two of them, homosexuals. Diagnosis was made by fibrobronchoscopy (FB) with bronchoaspiration (BAS) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), or sputum induced by physiological serum aerosol at three per cent, using in both cases blue tinction with toluidine 0 of the samples obtained. Given the foreseeable increase of this disease in our country, we stress the risk of a potential change in its clinical spectrum, affecting new population groups, mainly the elderly, as well as the development of new early diagnosis techniques and the emergence of new treatments, including corticotherapy.</dc:description>
