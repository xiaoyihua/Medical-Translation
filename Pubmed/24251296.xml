<dc:description xml:lang="en">The following article focuses the issue of Urban Tribes as a cultural phenomenon, and emphasize the latter topic will be taken consideration communication, anthropological, sociological and psychological, because it is impossible to describe this phenomenon if not take into account these variables, which form a network. I will try to explain of why of its appearance, its climax and its eventual demise with paroxysms. And basically not forget that in this constellation, the adolescent subject stands out as an actor, whose subjectivity is divided by these vicissitudes that sometimes behave dramatic overtones. In a final section I made an approach to three tribes of less transcended in Argentina, through the words of their protagonists, to know what is the dynamics of these "youth groups".</dc:description>
