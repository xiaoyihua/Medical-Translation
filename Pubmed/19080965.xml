<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Smoking is an important cardiovascular risk factor whose underlying mechanism is incompletely understood. However, it has been suggested that alterations in the balance between synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) may play a role. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an independent association between smoking and the concentration of circulating metalloproteinases (MMPs) in individuals without cardiovascular disease. METHODS Metabolic parameters, the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), inflammatory markers (fibrinogen, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6), markers of endothelial damage (e.g., von Willebrand factor), and the concentration of MMP-1, -9 and -10 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) were assessed in 400 asymptomatic individuals with cardiovascular risk factors. Subjects were divided into non-smokers (n=195), smokers (n=118) and former smokers (n=87). In addition, global cardiovascular risk was determined from PROCAM and REGICOR scores. RESULTS Both MMP-1 and MMP-10 concentrations were significantly higher in smokers than non-smokers (P&lt; .05 and P&lt; .001, respectively), though there was no difference in the levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1, IMT and other inflammatory parameters. There were positive correlations between the MMP-10 concentration and PROCAM and REGICOR scores (P&lt; .001). Multivariate analysis showed that there was still an association between smoking and the MMP-10 concentration after adjustment for age, sex and other cardiovascular risk factors (P&lt; .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that smoking accounted for 28% of the variability in the MMP-10 concentration. CONCLUSIONS There was an independent association between smoking and the MMP-10 concentration in asymptomatic individuals. This relationship between MMP-10 and the ECM may indicate a mechanism through which this MMP contributes to smoking-related atherosclerosis.</dc:description>
