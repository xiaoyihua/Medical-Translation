<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION There is wide evidence about dopaminergic and noradrenergic mechanisms in fronto-striatal circuits which are thought to be related with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) neurobiology. That dysfunction may explain core symptoms and part of executive deficits in cognitive functioning. Methylphenidate is effective in alleviating core symptoms, enhancing dopaminergic and noradrenergic biodisponibility. Less evidence in improving executive functions, specially working memory is found. AIMS To assess if methylphenidate-OROS has a potential effect increasing working memory and attention parameters in ADHD children, and to determine if initial working memory and attention differences between ADHD and control group disappear after one month of daily methylphenidate-OROS treatment. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Eleven children with ADHD were selected and as control group was chosen eleven children compared in age, intelligence quotient, school grade, and social-demographic status. Neuropsychological battery was administered in naive ADHD patients at three times, before treatment, after the first methylphenidate-OROS dose, and after one month of daily treatment. Simultaneously neuropsychological battery was administered to control group. RESULTS. Statistically significant differences were found in neuropsychological variables of working memory after one month daily treatment with methylphenidate-OROS and attention parameters after only one dose in ADHD group. Differences between naive ADHD and control group in terms of working memory were statistically significant before treatment but not after one month daily treatment. CONCLUSION Methylphenidate-OROS improves attention achievement after the first dose and working memory after one month of daily treatment.</dc:description>
