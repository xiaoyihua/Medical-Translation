<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE To analyse frequency, characteristics and survival of women with lung cancer (LC), in contrast to male patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective study was performed in patients with LC diagnosed by histocytology from 1999 to 2006. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The chi-squared test was used to compare variables. RESULTS A total of 1,290 patients were diagnosed, 190 (14.7%) of them were women, with a mean age of 67±13 years. The percentage of smokers was 17%. Histological types: adenocarcinoma 53%, small cell 21%, squamous cell carcinoma 13%. Surgery was performed (20%) in a higher percentage of women than in men. There were no differences in survival between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Of the total cases diagnosed, 14.7% were women, with a lower percentage of smokers. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histological type in women. There was no differences in survival compared to men.</dc:description>
