<dc:description xml:lang="en">The effectiveness of two systems of persuasion for persons willing to quit smoking was compared in the context of health educational activities: the traditional method (TN), based on the warning of the risk of disease and death, and a method of positive reinforcement focused on the better quality of life and health level (TP. The study had a controlled trial format, with three randomized groups: One with TN, receiving the traditional negative approach; other with TP, the positive treatment; and another group without therapy. After a 15, 30, 60 and 90 days of follow-up it could not be shown that TP is superior to TN. The former appeared as more effective but without significant differences.</dc:description>
