<dc:description xml:lang="en">An epidemiological focal study was performed in Loncopué, Neuquén, Argentina, in November 2002 to detect the origin of the infection in a human case of fascioliasis confirmed by an indirect-ELISA test, six months before the study. Thirty five individual fecal samples were taken from domestic livestock, and watercress plants and snails were collected from the irrigation ditches connected to a main canal in the surroundings of the patient's house. A new blood sample was taken from the already recovered patient. The patient was still seropositive to Fasciola hepatica antigens. No metacercariae were found in the 222 watercress leaves checked. All the snails collected (n=130) were identified as Lymnaea viatrix and two out of 101 (2%) were infected with F. hepatica larvae. Coprological analysis showed F. hepatica eggs in 100% of goats (10/10), 82% of sheep (9/11) and 86% of bovines (6/7). The number of eggs per gram shed by positive goats (median=20.7, Q1=6.2, Q3=34.5) and sheep (4, 1.8, 13) was significantly higher than in cows (0.3, 0.3, 1.7) (p &lt; 0.01). Local veterinary control programs were apparently not effective in this case. Anthelmintics used and treatment schedule should be revised and small herds raised at households should also be included and treated.</dc:description>
