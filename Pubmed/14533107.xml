<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Chorea is an infrequent disorder at the paediatric age which has a number of both hereditary and acquired causes. Post-streptococcal or Sydenham's chorea (SC) is still the main cause of chorea in children, in spite of the drop in prevalence of rheumatic fever in the last few years. SC is a benign, self-limiting disorder, but may last for several months and can be highly disabling. Several different types of symptomatic treatment have been proposed, for example corticoids, haloperidol, valproic acid, and carbamazepine. In each case, both the speed with which the clinical improvement is brought about, and the degree to which they are tolerated and the absence of side effects must be evaluated. CASE REPORT We present a new case of SC that had been developing for three months. Carbamazepine was effective from the tenth day onwards and total remission of the symptoms was achieved in six weeks. Total follow-up time was nine months, and in this time no relapses or side effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS This contribution offers new evidence supporting carbamazepine as another first choice medication in the treatment of this type of chorea.</dc:description>
