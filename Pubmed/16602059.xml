<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION According to the oxidative stress hypothesis, the pathogenesis of several diseases should be related with an excessive production of prooxidant substances (free radicals, transition metals), the deficiency of antioxidant defensive mechanisms, or both. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of aging of the brain and several neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). DEVELOPMENT In recent years there are many data suggesting a possible role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD. These include the demonstration of increased oxidation of lipids, proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid, alterations in mitochondrial function and the possible role of amyloid beta and its precursor protein in the oxidative reactions in experimental models (cortical neuronal cultures and transgenic animals). CONCLUSIONS Many studies show increased oxidative stress in the brain of patients with AD, although its possible role con the pathogenesis of this disease are controversial.</dc:description>
