<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dabigatran is an oral anticoagulant from the class of the direct thrombin inhibitors, indicated for prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation. Unlike warfarin, dabigatran has no known antidote. Hemodialysis has been suggested as a method for removing dabigatran and thereby reducing its anticoagulant effect. We report the case of a patient with a known history of atrial fibrillation, treated with dabigatran, who was admitted for emergency abdominal surgery. At six hours after the last dose received, coagulation studies were altered. In absence of an antidote to reverse its effects, it was decided to perform hemodialysis. After three hours of dialysis coagulation parameters were improved and the patient underwent surgery without showing abnormal bleeding during surgery or in the postoperative period.</dc:description>
