<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the amount and type of procedures performed by three groups of emergency medicine residents in an emergency service in a Mexico City campus. METHODS We carried out an observational study using a sampling type census with the authorization of the local internal review board (IRB). We followed 33 emergency medicine residents working in Mexico City during the 2007-2008 academic year. We registered the procedures performed and skills displayed by participants in a daily, weekly and monthly format. We included age, gender, academic degree and rotation service. Using descriptive statistics we calculated frequencies, means and standard deviations. RESULTS All 33 residents (100%) participated in the study; 33.36% were first year, 33.36% second and 27.27% third year resident. Mean age was of 26.2 +/- 3.5 year and 81.81% were male. Eighteen services where residents carried out their duties were assessed. We recorded a total of 12,075 different procedures and grouped skills under 20 subtypes. 33.30% were performed by first-year, 38.29% by second-year, and 28.42% by third-year. The most common procedures included advanced handling of the aerial route (2,376), central venous accesses (2,307), and resuscitation maneuvers (1,624). CONCLUSIONS The number of procedures carried out at this medical facility is high with a heavier work load than the one reported in the international literature. We should monitor and compare data among different sites in order to have a clearer picture of the status of emergency medicine specialists in Mexico.</dc:description>
