<dc:description xml:lang="en">Caring for chronic illnesses at all ages represents a growing social and public health problem. Due to insufficient public coverage in Spain, around 80% of long-term care is provided by the sick person's social network. Based in ethnographic research on chronicity carried out between 2009 and 2013 in Spain, this article analyzes the problem of long-term informal care for middle-aged adults with chronic diseases. The results highlight the factors that condition, enhance or limit informal care: the personal, domestic and family situation of the sick person; the cyclical course of chronic diseases; and the social response to illness. The limitations of the informal care model suggest the need to listen to the voices of those affected in order to understand their real needs and adapt official programs oriented towards chronicity accordingly.</dc:description>
