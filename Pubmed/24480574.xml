<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the results obtained in 25 males with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (MCRPC) treated with abiraterone (AA). A comparative analysis of abiraterone effectiveness and safety between our results and data published in the literature was conducted. MATERIAL AND METHOD Bi-institutional prospective analysis of 25 consecutive patients with MCRPC undergoing treatment with abiraterone, with a mean follow-up 7.9 (3-15) months was carried out. Treatment effectiveness and safety analyses regarding baseline characteristics of patients (age, prior treatments, basal PSA, performance status, pain, metastasis) were conducted. RESULTS At 13.6 months of follow-up, the overall survival is 80% (CI 95%: 11.8-15.4). Clinical and radiological-free progression survival is 9.5 ± 1 months (CI 95%: 7.7-11.3) and biochemical response is 6.8 ± 1 months (CI 95%: 5-8.7). Only the treatment with chemotherapy impaired significantly the response time to AA [6.4 months for radiological-free progression survival (CI 95%: 4.2-8,6) and 4.3 months for biochemical-free progression survival (CI 95%: 2.6-6)]. The incidence of adverse drug events was 36%, all of them grade 1-2/4 and, in no case, suspension or reduction of the dose of AA was needed. CONCLUSIONS The treatment with AA has been effective in our series, with a tolerability considerably higher than what other studies published.</dc:description>
