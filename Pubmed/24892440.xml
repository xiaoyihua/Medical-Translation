<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE This study was motivated as only partial knowledge is available (regarding national statistics) about accidents caused by poisonous animals in Colombia. The study was aimed at establishing a base-line concerning accidents reported by phone to the Toxicology Management and Research Information Centre (CIGITOX) from all over Colombia; such data was taken from the centre's data-base following its five years of being in operation(2006-2010). METHODS This was a descriptive, retrospective study, taking information from the CIGITOX database over a five-year period (2006-2010); Excel 2011was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS The database contained 1,783 cases which had been reported and attended; 47 % concerned snake bite accidents (an obligatory report event in Colombia), 25 % scorpion stings and 11 % spider bites, followed by others having valuable epidemiologic representation in the main areas of occurrence, such as the Antioquia, Valle del Cauca and Cundinamarca departments. DISCUSSION The data provided an overview of the situation which could lead to promoting public health program aimed at raising awareness in communities, institutions and healthcare professional's whilst enforcing their ability to respond effectively.</dc:description>
