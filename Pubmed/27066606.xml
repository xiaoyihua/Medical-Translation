<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mental disorders significantly contribute to the burden of disease, reduce the quality of life, and pose vast economic and social costs. Furthermore, access to treatment and treatment quality is often poor, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Indeed, WHO urged countries to develop policies and comprehensive mental health strategies. In response, Argentina promulgated a National Mental Health Law (NMHL, No. 26.657) that was regulated through the Regulatory Decree No. 603/2013 and implemented through the National Mental Health Plan (NMHP). The NMHL defines the vision, values, and principles for improving the mental health system for the country via urging that mental health care be based on scientific evidence adjusted to ethical principles. This is not new in other areas of health; however, it implies a paradigm shift for the mental health system in Argentina. Inconsistencies between the conceptual framework that raises the NMHL and operational instruments issued by the National Mental Health and Addiction Department were observed. These inconsistencies reflect the resistance to change in paradigm.</dc:description>
