<dc:description xml:lang="en">Numerous studies have described an association between respiratory sincticial virus (RSV) infection in infancy and the subsequent development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Besides the exaggerated immune response and the abnormal neurogenic mechanisms induced by RSV, recent studies have correlated the "persistence" of RSV in the lower respiratory tract with the development of AHR. Several investigators have evaluated whether treatment with antiviral or immunosuppressive agents could decrease the long term respiratory abnormalities induced by RSV. The RSV murine model has allowed us to study the immunopathogenesis of RSV-induced AHR. Once the airway obstruction, typical of acute disease, is resolved and no virus is longer detected by cell cultures, mice progress into a chronic phase characterized by AHR and persistent airway inflammation. The use of polymerase chain reaction assay for RSV quantitation has demonstrated, quite unexpectedly, the presence of RSV RNA in the lower respiratory tract of mice during the chronic phase of the disease. As an example of intervention, the administration of an anti-RSV neutralizing antibody (palivizumab) was associated with a significant reduction in viral replication, pulmonary inflammation and inflammatory cytokines, as well as a significant improvement in the pulmonary function both in the acute and chronic phases of the disease. Future clinical studies to determine whether therapy with palivizumab can prevent the long-term morbidity associated with RSV in children are warranted.</dc:description>
