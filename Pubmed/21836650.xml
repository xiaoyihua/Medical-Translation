<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Detection of gastric atrophy could be used for early diagnosis of gastric cancer in Perú. It was determined the pepsinogens I and II (PGI, PGII) and Gastrin-17 (G17) serum levels, and the PGI/PGII ratio as a non-invasive diagnostic test for gastric atrophy in Peruvian patiens. METHODS Dyspeptic adults undergoing endoscopy and gastric biopsies were studied.For each case with atrophy two controls without atrophy were selected. Differences were evaluated and ROC curves constructed. A serologic profile was produced combining PGI and PGI/PGII ratio. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated. RESULTS 22 cases and 44 controls were included. Areas under ROC curves were 0.599, 0.546 and 0.534 for PGI, PGII and PGI/PGII ratio, respectively. None of these allowed for discrimination between cases and controls. The serological profile did not reach appropriate sensitivity and specificity. DISCUSSION This first study of pepsinogen, gastrin and atrophy in Peru showed none of these tests to be useful. Their potential impact in early detection and prevention of prevalent cancer justify further investigation. Recruiting more patients, excluding those previously treated for Helicobacter pylori, and processing independently the antrum and corpus biopsies, could reveal findings not seen in present study.</dc:description>
