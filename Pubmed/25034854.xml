<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen that requires prior nasopharyngeal colonization to cause disease. An epidemiological study was conducted on nasopharyngeal carriers of pneumococci in healthy children in Murcia after the introduction of the VCN7, and immediately before the marketing of new vaccines, with the aim of determining the influence of vaccination in our geographic area, and other factors in relation to the state of being a carrier, and the different circulating serotypes. METHODS A multicentre study was conducted in in 60 primary care health centres in summer 2009 and winter of 2010. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected, and an epidemiological study was carried out on 1562 children aged 1 and 4 years. Of the 1562 nasopharyngeal samples, pneumococci were found in 489 of them, with 343 of them able to be serotyped (70.2%). RESULTS The prevalence of carriers was 31.3%. Of the patients included, 61.7% (964/1562) had received at least one dose of VCN7. Only 12.8% of the identified serotypes were vaccine serotypes. The independent protective factors against colonization were; Summer time in all age groups, previous vaccination in all the children (OR: 0.75; 95%CI: 0.56-0.93]; P=.01, and in 1-year-olds (OR: 0.6; 95%CI: 0.42-0.84; P=.002), and had taken antibiotics in the last month in the total cohort [OR: 0.69; 95%CI: 0.50-0.96). On the other hand, attendance at school or day-care centre (OR: 1.85; 95%CI: 1.27-2.18; P=.001), number of siblings (OR: 1.3; 95%CI: 1.01-1.91), and passive tobacco smoke exposure (OR: 1.33; 95%CI: 1.02-1.73), were colonization risk factors. The serotypes 6A, 19A, 23B, 15A/B, 11A, 14, 23A/F, 3 y 19F were the most prevalent. CONCLUSIONS A low proportion of SV was found, with 14, 23F and 19F are persisting. A high prevalence of serotypes 6A and 19A was found. Summer time, vaccination, and the prior administration of antibiotics proved to be protective against colonization, whereas schooling, smoking, and siblings contributed to it.</dc:description>
