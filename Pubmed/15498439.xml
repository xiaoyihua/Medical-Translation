<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE A secular trend in growth has been reported in developed countries. Our aim was to evaluate weight, height and body mass index values in a middle class sample of people from Barcelona and compare these values with those obtained before 1987. SUBJECTS AND METHOD Height, weight and body mass index were evaluated in a) 268 male and 243 female newborns from normal gestations of 40 weeks, born in 2001 and 2002; b) 158 boys and 146 girls born during 1998-2000 and evaluated every 0.25-0.50 years from 0.25 to 3 years of age; c) 2,781 boys and 2,476 girls, aged 3-18 years, evaluated in 2002 and 2003, and distributed in 0.5 year intervals, and d) 394 males and 364 females, aged 18-24 years, evaluated in 2002 and 2003. RESULTS Mean, standard deviation and percentiles values with 0.25-0.5 year-period intervals from birth to adulthood are reported. In comparison with data obtained before 1987 in Spanish populations, an increase of 3.5 cm was observed in adult height in both sexes as well as an increase of 7-8.3 kg in percentiles 3, 50 and 97 values in male adult weight with no significant differences in female adult weight. Moreover, pubertal growth spurt begins one year earlier in both boys and girls. Age of menarche (12.78 [1.30] years) was similar in our adult female population and in the female population evaluated before 1987. CONCLUSIONS A secular trend in growth was observed in our population. There is a need to update periodically the growth data used in the evaluation of children and adolescents.</dc:description>
