<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Temporal artery (TA) biopsy is required for the evaluation of several clinical scenarios because of the therapeutic implications of a positive result. We describe the experience of our department, which is the center for this technique in our hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective study was made of all TA biopsies performed in the Department of Otolaryngology, Hospital Sierrallana, from January 1995 to April 1997. RESULTS Thirty-four biopsies of the TA artery were performed in 33 patients for possible temporal arteritis. Mean age was 76 years (range: 61-87 years). Twelve were male and 21 female. Twenty-two patients (66.6%) had recent onset cephalalgia, 11 (33.3%) polymyalgia rheumatica, 5 (15.1%) mandibular claudication, and 8 (24.2%) ocular symptoms. In 75.8% ESR was elevated. An abnormal TA exam was observed in 9 cases (27.3%), 6 of which had a positive biopsy. Only 1 of the 15 patients without local findings at the physical examination had a positive TA biopsy. No information on the physical exam was recorded for the other 2 patients with a positive biopsy. CONCLUSIONS TA biopsy is a relatively easy surgical procedure with a very low rate of complications. An abnormal physical TA examination correlates with a positive histopathological study.</dc:description>
