<dc:description xml:lang="en">Meperidine was the first synthetic opioid agent. It acts mainly as an antagonist of mu (#m) receptors and has an analgesic potency ten times greater than that of morphine. Like other opioid drugs, meperidine causes nausea, vomiting, urinary retention and respiratory depression; a point of difference, however, is that it acts on nerve fibers and has properties similar to those of local anesthetics. It has therefore been used as an alternative to other opioids for anesthetic blockade. We review the indications and contraindications of meperidine administered by different routes. For pain, epidural administration has proven to be a good alternative to intravenous administration and epidural meperidine has been combined with local anesthetics using lower doses of both drugs and producing fewer side effects. Intradural meperidine has been used as the sole anesthetic agent in various types of surgery, its principal advantage being that it provides long-lasting postoperative analgesia. Spinal meperidine has the advantage over morphine of a lower incidence of respiratory depression, particularly late-occurring depression. An intravenous route has been used for treating moderate to severe pain, for regional anesthesia, for premedication and for analgesia during anesthesia. Meperidine's action on kappa receptors has meant that it is considered the most effective drug for treating postanesthetic trembling. Although meperidine has been used effectively to treat non-surgical pain, mainly from colic, this review focuses on its usefulness in the perioperative period.</dc:description>
