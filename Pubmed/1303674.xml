<dc:description xml:lang="en">The results of 188 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, studied between 1985 and 1990, showed that 8 cases were CD10 negative, Dr, and CD19 positive. These findings indicate cell dedifferentiation and poor prognosis. The patients age ranged from 2 to 30 years, with a mean of 11 years. The male/female ratio was 5/3. Lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly were found in the 8 patients. With the exception of one patient in whom leucopenia was present, the white cell counts were always higher than 30,000/dl. The karyotype was studied in four cases, and all of them were hyperdiploid. This is the first report in Venezuela of cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia - CD 10 negative.</dc:description>
