<dc:description xml:lang="es">A descriptive retrospective study was carried out to identify the characteristics of preterm delivery in Youth Island during the triennium 2007-2009. A total of 148 cases were examined, based on a review of the Registry of Deliveries and individual and obstetric case histories, as well as the newborns&#146; case histories. The most frequent maternal characteristics were age less than 24 years (55%), a history of two abortions (38%) and/or a previous childbirth (46%), delivery at 34.0 to 36.6 weeks&#146; gestational age (71%), and birthweight of more than 2000 grams (69% of the neonates). The most frequent obstetric complications were vaginal discharge syndrome (77%), urinary tract infection (53%), premature rupture of membranes (23%) and hypertension (22%). Labor was spontaneous in 64% of the patients and only 49% of the preterm deliveries occurred through the vaginal route. Two-thirds of preterm deliveries started spontaneously and almost half occurred through the vaginal route. The most frequent complications in preterm neonates were respiratory distress syndrome (26%) and sepsis (18%). Only 5.4% of all preterm neonates died (AU)</dc:description>
