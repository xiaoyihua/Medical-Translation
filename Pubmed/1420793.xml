<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To carry out a review of hematoma in the abdominal wall: etiology, triggering factors, diagnosis and treatment. To consider differential diagnosis with other causes of acute abdominal pain with palpable mass. DESIGN Based on two clinical observations. SITE. Iscar Health Centre, Valladolid. PATIENTS Two patients who presented themselves at Casualty complaining of acute abdominal pain and with palpable abdominal mass (lump). MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS The anamnesis and physical exploration provided the tentative diagnosis, and they were sent to the Hospital centre in question. The analyses, X-rays and abdominal scans were not conclusive and an abdominal laparotomy was carried out which confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Spontaneous haematoma in the abdominal wall is a cause of acute abdominal pain which is encountered most frequently in women receiving anticoagulant treatment or in situations that increase abdominal muscular tension (coughing, pregnancy, constipation, previous laparotomies and intraabdominal injections). Confirmation of initial diagnosis is obtained, normally, using sonic scanners, or abdominal TAC, but on occasions findings are not conclusive, and are submitted to abdominal laparotomy. The treatment is conservative except with hemodynamic complications.</dc:description>
