<dc:description xml:lang="en">Suckling hamsters infected with three low passaged strains of Junin virus by intracerebral route developed a non differentiated illness with about 7 log of virus replication in the brain after which they either died between 6 and 19 days post inoculation or developed CF antibodies. Even in suckling hamsters and suckling mice gave similar results for viral titration, isolation attempts were less successful in hamsters. The young hamster response was characterized by a severe neurological disease and subsequent recovery with the development of CF antibodies 3). Except for isolation efficiency, the results obtained with Junin virus are similar to those reported for other arenavirus.</dc:description>
