<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS To evaluate postoperative morbidity and mortality, pancreatic function and long-term survival in patients with surgically treated pancreatic or periampullar tumours. PATIENTS AND METHODS Cohort study including 160 patients consecutively operated on: 80 pancreaticoduodenectomies (PD), 30 distal pancreatectomies (DP), 7 total pancreatectomies, 4 central pancreatic resections and 3 ampullectomies. The tumour was not resected in 36 patients. Pancreatic function was evaluated by oral glucose tolerance test, faecal fat excretion and elastase. RESULTS Resectability rate was 77.5%. In resected patients (n = 124), 38.7% had complications with a pancreatic fistula rate of 6.4% and a mortality rate of 4%. In PD, endocrine function worsened in 41% and 58.6% had steatorrhoea; these figures in DP were 53.6% and 21.7% respectively. In the 36 non-resected patients, postoperative morbidity was 27.7% and mortality 8.3%. Two and five-year survival rates in resected patients with pancreatic cancer were 42% and 9% respectively; in malignant ampulloma 71% and 53%; in mucinous adenocarcinomas 83% and 33%; in duodenal adenocarcinoma 100% and 75%; and in distal cholangiocarcinoma 50% and 50%. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity associated with resective pancreatic surgery is still high, but perioperative mortality is low. Endocrine and exocrine disturbances are very common depending on the type of resection. Despite the associated morbidity and functional disorders, surgery provides long-term survival in selected cases.</dc:description>
