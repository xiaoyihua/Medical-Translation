<dc:description xml:lang="en">Health workers of the emergency service are frequently exposed to different dangers, among them the contact with biological polluting agents. This is a study of descriptive character, with the objective to characterize workers on social demographic aspects, and also to verify the level of application of the bio-security norms at the emergency services of a health institution in the city of Bogota, Colombia. 68,3% of the workers are with a contract in the modality of benefit of services, the 31,7%, are in the modality of indefinite term. 44,6% of the personnel have not received the qualification on bio-security, and 42,4% do not apply the suitable technique of washing hands. In relation to the aspect of the return to use needles, 31% was doing this practice. All workers have the complete kit of Hepatitis B vaccine, but the same percentage does not have measurement of Hepatitis B antibodies. It is fundamental the provision of elements of personal protection and set of elements and containers that contribute to the bio-security. Pedagogical activities can be used to sensitize and create critical awareness to all personnel who work at emergency, about dangers and consequences that are exposed in their workplace. Measurements of titles of Hepatitis B are necessary to verify the immunological state of the workers.</dc:description>
