<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hospital medicine was created over 10 years ago aiming to provide an integral care to hospitalized patients. Hospital specialists are physicians mainly devoted to the global care of hospitalized patients. Their professional functions include patient care, teaching, clinical research and managing activities. The main difference with other specialties is their exclusive dedication to hospital work. The impact of this specialty on patient care has been demonstrated by a significant reduction in the hospitalization days and costs and higher level of patient satisfaction. In clinical hospitals, the presence of tutors during the complete working day, has resulted in better pre and postgraduate teaching activities and a higher availability of supervisors for trainees. Four years ago, hospital medicine was established as a discipline at the Clinical Hospital of Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. In this period, these specialists became essential for student training and an integral part of the faculty staff.</dc:description>
