<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To determine the clinical profile and to develop a model to predict 90-day mortality in centenarian patients attended in emergency departments (ED). METHODOLOGY This was an observational, retrospective, multicentre cohort study including patients &gt;99years attended in 5 ED in the Community of Madrid from January to December 2012. Demographic variables were recorded, as well as, comorbidities, cognitive, functional, social basal status, geriatric syndromes, acute episode, and hospital and social resources use, and 90-day mortality. RESULTS The study included 209patients aged 101years (SD 1.7) of whom 161 (77.0%) were female. Sixty four (32.5%) had severe comorbidity (Charlson index≥3), 101 (49.8%) on multiple medication, 100 (52.6%) had cognitive impairment, 82 (42.3%) had severe functional dependence, 85 (40.7%) were institutionalised, and 190 (94.5%) had a geriatric syndrome. Dyspnoea (26.8%), followed by falls (12.4%) were the most common causes of attendance. One hundred and eighteen (56.5%) were admitted, and 58 out of 174 (33.3%) died in the first 90days. The model to predict 90-day overall mortality included male sex (OR 2.42 95% CI=0.97-6.04; P=.059), emergency care in the previous 3months (OR 4.08 95% CI=1.26-13.16; P=.019) and the hospitalization by index event (OR 8.63 95% CI=3.25-22.9; P&lt;.001) and this model had an area under ROC curve of 0.776 (95% CI=0.70-0.85; P&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS Centenarian patients attended in ED had a significant frailty and one in three cases died in the first 90days after being attended, and this was associated with male sex, emergency care in the previous 3months, and hospitalisation.</dc:description>
