<dc:description xml:lang="en">An indirect hemagglutination test (IHAT) for trichinosis using a Melcher's antigen was evaluated and compared with a precipitin test (PT) and a bentonite flocculation test (BFT). One hundred and forty eight serum samples from patients from the whole country confirmed or suspected to have trichinosis by clinical or epidemiological evidences were studied: 117 (79.1%) samples resulted positive by IHAT, 138 (93.2%) by PT and 65 (43.9%) by BFT. Sixty three serum samples from patients with strong clinical suspect of trichinosis presented the PT and the BFT positive and were compared with the IHAT for sensitivity study. IHAT was positive in 60 (95.2%) serum samples. In order to determine the specificity of IHAT 25 serum samples from healthy volunteers and 124 serum samples from individuals with other parasitoses, such as cysticercosis (48), hydatidosis (45) and fascioliasis (31) were studied. The specificity, using a titre &gt; or = 1:16 as a possible diagnostic value was 96%. The use of IHAT with RP and BFT in the diagnosis of human trichinosis is discussed.</dc:description>
