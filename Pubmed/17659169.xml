<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND We undertook this study to demonstrate the experience with Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy in the Coloproctology Unit in the Gastroenterology Service of the General Hospital in Mexico City. METHODS A prospective, descriptive and observational study was designed and included patients with hemorrhoidal disease submitted to hemorrhoidectomy with Ferguson technique, from May 1999 to April 2004. Preoperative data included in the patient's chart was as follows: sex, age, time of evolution of symptoms, classification of hemorrhoids, associated disease, operative duration, immediate and late surgical complications and their management and healing duration. RESULTS Five hundred eighty six patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 342 were male (58.36%) and 244 (41.69%) female. Average age was 43 years (range: 20-78 years). Occupation was not reported. Classification of hemorrhoids was 46 (7.85%), grade II; 396 (67.57%), grade III; 82 (13.99%), grade IV; and 62 (10.59%), massive hemorrhoid thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS Results of this series conclude that perioperative morbidity is lower than reported in other series and that hemorrhoidectomy with Ferguson technique continues as the gold standard for treatment of this disease.</dc:description>
