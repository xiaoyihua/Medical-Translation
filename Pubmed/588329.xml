<dc:description xml:lang="en">Possible relationship between childhood cancer and host immunity was studied by assessment of delayed hypersensitivity assayed by skin testing. Reactivity to a battery of potential secondary skin test antigens and a primary antigen, dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) was determined in 46 children with various malignancies and 28 healthy controls. Rechallenge to DNCB 50 and 100 mcg was tested in 26 children an in the controls. Secondary antigenic patterns showed little difference from controls or between surviving or living patients. Anery to DNCG rechallenge was a prominent finding in children dying with cancer. Immune altertion of some non tumor specific factors therefore seems to be associated with prognosis in some childhood cancers.</dc:description>
