<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To examine the relationship between co-morbidity, functional capacity, mood and perception of social support, and the physical and mental dimensions of the Health-Related Quality of Life and assess the differences between institutionalised elderly men and women without severe cognitive impairment in Cuenca, Spain. METHODS A cross sectional, descriptive and multicentre study was conducted in 16 nursing homes. A representative sample of 281 elderly patients was randomly selected. MEASURES demographic, clinic variables and standardised tools: SF12 health questionnaire, Mini-Mental State Examination, Barthel Index, Geriatric Depression Scale and Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey. Data analysis was performed using multiple lineal regression models for physical and mental dimension of SF12, differentiated for gender. RESULTS The sample included 55% elderly women with an mean age of 82.6 years, and 45% men with a mean age of 81.2 years. Comorbidity was higher in women (1.96), but in the linear regression this was not associated with the physical dimension of HRQOL. We found an association with disability (β=313), depressive symptoms (β=-.164) and perceived social support (β=158). The worst HRQOL in women was found in the mental dimension associated with depressive symptoms (β= -.422) and in the low perceived social support (β=154). CONCLUSIONS Biological and functional factors were only associated with the physical dimension, while depression was associated with both dimensions (physical and psychological). The differential factor that could explain the lower HRQOL in institutionalised women could be explained by a more negative experience of the disability and loss of social support.</dc:description>
