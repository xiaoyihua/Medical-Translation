<dc:description xml:lang="en">Recent historical inquiries have shed light on a series of articles published between 1840 and 1868 by Ram칩n Alfaro M.D. His publications reflect the work of a persevering medical researcher who carried out studies of health conditions endemic at the time. One of his first publications is devoted to chloroform. In it, Dr. Alfaro made a careful assessment on the use of anesthesia, published the first statistical study of the impact of inhalational anesthesia in a number of surgical procedures, and was able to establish the foundations for more rational and safe anesthetic procedures.</dc:description>
