<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Pregnancy is a physiological hypercoagulable state with an increased incidence of thromboembolic phenomena. There is an increase in the concentrations of most clotting factors, a decrease in concentration of some of the natural anticoagulants and reduced fibrinolytic activity. Changes in PS levels have also been reported. AIM To establish referral range values of functional PS and free PS antigen, during the second (2nd T) and third trimester (3rd T) of normal gestation. PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty one normal pregnant women were included in our study, 20 during the 2nd T (22-24 weeks) and 21 during the 3rd T (29-38 weeks). Functional PS was measured by a clot based test and free PS antigen by ELISA. RESULTS Free PS Antigen was 65.8+/-18.3% during the 2nd T and 62.3+/-16.5% during the 3rd T. The figures for normal controls were 106+/-6.5%. Functional PS was 43.8+/-13.3 and 25.9+/-14.6% during the 2nd T and 3rd T, respectively. The figures for normal controls were 97+/-24% (p &lt;0.001 compared with pregnant women). Free PS antigen did not change from the 2nd to the 3rd T (p=NS), however functional PS fell significantly from the 2nd to the 3rd T (p &lt;0.001) and was significantly lower than free PS antigen in both trimesters (p &lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS Pregnancy is associated to a decrease in PS. This abnormality is more pronounced for functional PS than free PS antigen and functional PS falls progressively during pregnancy. These assays should not be used to screen for PS deficiency during pregnancy because they could lead to a misdiagnosis.</dc:description>
