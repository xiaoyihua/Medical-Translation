<dc:description xml:lang="en">Results from studies comparing boys and girls diagnosed as having Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been non conclusive. In general, the results of such studies report boys as being more hyperactive and presenting more conduct problems, and girls as having more cognitive and learning problems. The aim of this study was to collect information about the characterization of the disorder depending on the gender. 169 children (123 males, 46 females), between 4 and 13 years of age with ADHD were studied. The assessment battery included Conners' rating scales-Revised for parents and teachers, short forms of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III) and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised (WPPSI-R), academic achievement measures, developmental history and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-IV Version-Parents (DISC-IV). The results indicated the lack of significant differences between genders for the studied variables, ADHD boys and girls scored alike in the various behavioral and cognitive measures. The results presented describe homogeneity in the symptoms, demographic characteristics and neuropsychological functioning for children of both genders; suggesting a syndrome with the same criteria and independent of the gender.</dc:description>
