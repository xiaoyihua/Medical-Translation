<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to investigate the frequency of corneal micro-deposits of amiodarone and its relationship to age, sex, dose and treatment duration, we studied one-hundred-fifty consecutive patients from 1982 to 1986. The average age was 33.8 +/- 17.5 years for eighty woman and seventy men. The mean weekly dose was of 1.1 +/- 0.3 g and the duration was 23.7 +/- 15.3 months. A complete eye examination was performed in all cases. The corneal micro-deposits were classified in three levels according to their density. In one-hundred-fourteen cases there were corneal micro-deposits; sixty-nine had grade I, thirty grade II and fifteen grade III. None had visual disturbances. There was only a direct statistical correlation between age and micro-deposit levels. Nine cases had also deposits of pigment in the lens. Two cases presented atypical keratopathy which by their involution after withdrawal of the drug was considered to be amiodarone-related. Fifteen cases presented chronic blepharitis, and ten, chronic non-secreting conjunctivitis. Therefore, age is a determinant factor for corneal accumulation of amiodarone micro-deposits.</dc:description>
