<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The purpose of this study is to compare two patient cohorts with Bankart lesion, one with intraarticular drainage after surgery and another group without drainage. MATERIAL AND METHODS We designed a study cohort for patients with Bankart repair due to relapsing shoulder dislocation; they underwent arthroscopy and were stabilized with suture anchors; intraarticular drainage was used in one group and no drainage was used in a control patient cohort. Thirty-one consecutive patients were operated by the same team. All patients were evaluated at the office using the Rowe, Constant and UCLA scales. The statistical tests used included chi-square, the student-t test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test (nonparametric version). RESULTS The UCLA median value was 35 (34.5-35) in group B and 33 (32.5 -35) in group A, with p = 0.13. The Rowe test score was 100 (95;100) in group B and 100 in group A (85;100), with p = 0.913. The Constant test score was 96 (88.8-98) in group B and 96 (90.5-100) in group A with p = 0.535 and no differences. DISCUSSION This comparative study includes two groups that underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair, one with drainage and another one without drainage. Good results were obtained in both groups. In this study the placement of a postoperative intraarticular drainage did not improve clinical results, as no statistically significant differences were observed between both groups.</dc:description>
