<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Due to the known role of preventive low dose magnesium sulphate on postoperative pain management, in this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we tried to investigate the possible relationship between low dose intra-operative magnesium sulphate infusion, postoperative analgesia and the level of serum beta-endorphin during total abdominal hysterectomy under general anesthesia. METHODS Forty women undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy were randomly allocated into 2 groups (20 in each arm). Fifteen minutes before induction of anaesthesia, the case group received a continuous intravenous infusion of magnesium sulphate (15mg/kg/h) and placebo control group received the same volume of isotonic saline. Pain scores were assessed at 0, 6, 12, and 24h after operations using Verbal Numeric Rating Scale. Pethidine consumption was recorded precisely. Serum level of beta-endorphin just 15min before the induction and at the end of the operations was determined by ELISA technique. RESULTS At 6 and 12h after the operations, Verbal Numeric Rating Scale in the case group was significantly lower than that of placebo control group (P=.0001). Over 24h after the operations, pethidine consumption was significantly lower in the case group compared with control group (P=.0001). In the case group, serum level of beta-endorphin was significantly decreased at the end of the operations compared with before the induction (P=.04). CONCLUSION We illustrated that preventive low dose intra-operative magnesium sulphate infusion reduces postoperative pain, has opioid sparing effect and declines serum beta-endorphin concentration during total abdominal hysterectomy.</dc:description>
