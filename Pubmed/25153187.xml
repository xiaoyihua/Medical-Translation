<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Document the transnational utilization of health resources and services by Mexican immigrants in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between December 2009-February 2011, Interviews and focus groups were conducted in California and four states of México. Data were collected from 135 individuals, including return migrants, allopathic physicians and traditional healers. RESULTS Faced with obstacles to accessing US health care and some health services within the Mexican system, many immigrants within the US make use of Mexican health resources and services, either from a distance or during visits to Mexico. These resources and services include allopathic medicine, traditional medicine, and home remedies and medicines. CONCLUSIONS The legal status of immigrants and their access to health insurance in the US are related to whether their transnational use of Mexican health resources and services is formal or informal; immigrants who are undocumented and without health insurance are the most vulnerable.</dc:description>
