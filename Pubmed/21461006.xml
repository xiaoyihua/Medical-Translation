<dc:description xml:lang="en">Vascular calcification has traditionally been considered to be a passive process that was associated with advanced age, atherosclerosis, uncommon genetic diseases and some metabolic alterations such as diabetes mellitus and end-stage kidney failure. However, in the last years, vascular calcification has been proven to be an active and regulated process, similar to bone mineralisation, in which different bone-related proteins are involved. Recent results question the classic classification of vascular calcification into intimal and medial calcification, at least in capacitance arteries. Pro and anti-calcifying mechanisms play an active role in calcium deposition in vascular cells, making this area an active focus of research. The identification of therapeutic targets which can slow down the progression or even reverse vascular calcification could be an important step forward in the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease.</dc:description>
