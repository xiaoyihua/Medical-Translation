<dc:description xml:lang="es">The success of retinoids in dermatology and skin care has made these chemical compounds to be a potential treatment for skin and dermatological diseases, being a key compound in the treatment of keratin disorders. Retinoids work by triggering molecular switches in skin cells called retinoid receptors. These switches affect many intracellular processes including the control of cell proliferation and cell differentiation. All these functions determine their usefulness in clinical dermatology being effective in the treatment of a number of dermatological conditions. The principal objective of the following article is to show retinoid acid cream 0,1% effect in the treatment of a specific keratin disorder, the neurovascular corn. The neurovascular corn is a dermatological disease whose principal treatment is the surgical excision. However, we should resort to others therapeutic strategies in different cases. Is in these situations when the retinoid acid will be a key compound for the treatment of the keratin disorder that takes place during the neurovascular corn evolution. Another objective of this study is to value the effectiveness of the retinoid acid cream as an adjuvant treatment of foot orthoses. An exploration protocol has been developed to covers from statistical dates to a clinical and dermoscopic exam of each neurovascular corn. Finally, a pain scale has been designed to value the degree of pain before starting the treatment and once topic treatment is completed. Based on the results we can conclude that topical retinoids are a very effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of dermatological conditions that are accompanied by a keratin disorder (AU)</dc:description>
