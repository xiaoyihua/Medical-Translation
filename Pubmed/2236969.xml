<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to identify prognostic features associated with in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) a prospective study was designed. A total of 130 first episodes of CPA were seen during a 6 month period. In 34 cases (26%) cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was attempted and 17 showed a positive response (recovery of cardiac automatism for more than 15 min). Median survival time in those who recovered was 38 hr. Only two patients were discharged alive from the hospital. Practice of CPR was strongly and inversely associated with the degree of anticipation on the occurrence of CPA held by the physician in charge. Age was the only variable prognostically associated with response to CPR, being the younger group (less than 40 yr) those with the worst prognosis. Aside of age and the possible beneficial effect of infection, there were no other demographic, clinical, therapeutic or other circumstances of the episode associated with response to CPR. The need of response systems to CPA, always in standby and reiterative training, is stressed.</dc:description>
