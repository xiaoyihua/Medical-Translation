<dc:description xml:lang="en">Reforms to psychiatric practice in Sweden are discussed, expecting that the Scandinavian experience be of assistance as regards changes that are being implemented for a re-structuration of psychiatric care in Latin America. The following points are enhanced: (a) epidemiological studies as an important basis for planning and action in mental health; (b) a progressive closing of mental hospitals while, at the same time, more institutionalization capacities are being created at general health services, and (c) organizing non-hospital care by sectors with community mental health teams being in charge of. As far as negative aspects are concerned, a tendency towards a "psychologization" so to speak of social issues, and a certain lack of attention of patients with severer disorders are pointed out.</dc:description>
