<dc:description xml:lang="en">Herbal remedies and other alternative treatments, such as acupuncture and homeopathy, are widely used in traditional societies and are becoming immensely popular in developed countries as well. Most are cheap, readily available, easy to use, and are perceived to be "healthier" than pharmaceutical substances. However, users need to be better informed as to the actual benefits and properties of these forms of therapy and their potential hazards. Improper use puts consumers at risk for potentially serious side effects as a result of allergy, drug interactions, contamination of the products with pesticides, heavy metals, and other substances, or trauma inflicted by inexperienced or poorly trained practitioners. Some traditional remedies can cause undesirable effects, such as excessive bleeding. Thus, it is essential that users have access to the information that is reliable, clear, and easily available. In June of this year the World Health Organization released a new set of guidelines to help national health authorities develop and distribute this type of information. The Guidelines on Developing Consumer Information on Proper Use of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, which were developed with the financial and technical support of the Government of Lombardy, Italy, and the Government of Sweden, are part of a collaborative project that seeks to promote the proper use of traditional, complementary, and alternative therapies by consumers. In addition to offering advice for government officials on how to prepare reliable consumer information, the guidelines contain a series of simple questions that can guide users through the process of deciding on the use of such therapies. The guidelines are published in English at the World Health Organization's website: http://www.who.int/en/</dc:description>
