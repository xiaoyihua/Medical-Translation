<dc:description xml:lang="en">This test was administered to a sample of 314 17 years old Argentine subjects (157 boy and 157 girls), and to another sample of 240 Argentine subjects, consisting of 127 boys and 113 girls of 20 years of age. Means, standard deviations and percentile ranks for both samples were obtained. To compare groups of different sex and age test of significance for mean differences of independent samples were applied. Boys obtained scores significantly higher than girls, without taking into consideration the age, in Factors C (lower ego strength-higher ego strength), E (submissiveness-dominance), H (threctia-parmia), Q1 (conservativism of temperament-radicalism) and Q3 (low self-sentiment integration - high strength of self sentiment). Contrarywise, girl showed scores significantly higher than boys of the same age in factors I (harria-premsia), N (artlessness-shrewdness), O (untroubled adequacy-guilt proneness) and Q4 (low ergic tension-high ergic tension).</dc:description>
