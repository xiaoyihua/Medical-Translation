<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To compare a Teflon prosthesis to a piston-type wire/Teflon prosthesis assessing auditory results post-Stapedectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a randomized controlled blinded clinical study from June 2003 to August 2004 at the Otorhinolaryngology, and Head and Neck Surgical Wards at the highly specialized medical unit of "La Raza" General Hospital National Medical Cen ter in Mexico City. The study group was comprised by patients receiving a Teflon prosthesis (Fluoroplastic piston) while the control group received a Schuckneckt type piston wire/Teflon prosthesis. A pre- and post-auditory assessment was done obtaining the average at low, medium and high airway frequencies, the air/bone frequency differences and the total, at the Audiology and Otoneurology Service at the same hospital using a Madzen Minimate 602 brand audiometer. The results were analyzed using SPSS statistical software version 8.0. RESULTS 138 patients were studied: 68 were included in the study group (Fluoroplastic prosthesis) and 70 in the control group (wire/Teflon prosthesis). A statistically significant difference was found between the groups (p &lt; 0.04) according to the Mann-Whitney U test. The air/bone closure difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001) at low and high frequency ranges for the study group.</dc:description>
