<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study presents the experience of one year of treatment in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with intrathecal TRH administered daily by a subcutaneous reservoir connected to the intrathecal lumbar space by a double catheter system as to provide continuous circulation of CSF and to avoid sac formation since this would be a source of infection. Clinical evaluation was carried out with a scale developed by the authors with the main aim of evaluating the loss of vital motor abilities and not as a localized evaluation. Secondary effects due to the implantation of the reservoir in addition to its use are presented although data were not important. Intrathecal administration of TRH was carried out similarly (600 micrograms/day) with secondary effects being the same as those by other routes of administration although of a lesser intensity. The results of the clinical evaluation at the beginning and end of the treatment as well as after patient follow up demonstrated that beneficial effects do not occur equally in all patients but rather are transitory and do not improve the natural evolution of the disease. The authors conclude that, methodologically, this series study does not enter within the frame of an advisable statistical study since the aim is to provide data for a future controlled study.</dc:description>
