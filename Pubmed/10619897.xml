<dc:description xml:lang="en">The evolution of 39 patients undergoing cordectomy by laryngofissure between 1980 and 1995 was analyzed. All patients were male. There were 33 (84.6%) T1a and 6 T1b (15.4%). Cause specific survival at 3, 5 and 10 years was 92.3, 89.7 and 89.7%, with an overall survival of 89.7, 84.3 and 65.8% at 3, 5 and 10 years respectively. Positive margins were found in two patients. Local recurrences were present in 4 patients (10.2%), loco-regional in 1 patient (2.5%), and paratracheal in 1 patient (2.5%). Salvage therapy included total laryngectomy in four patients (10.2%) and partial surgery in one patient. Correct evaluation of tumor extension and adequate free margin analysis are the essentials to avoid local recurrence after cordectomy, a well establish option for treatment of early glottic carcinoma.</dc:description>
