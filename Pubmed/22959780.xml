<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Domiciliary mechanical ventilation (DMV) use is increasing in children. Few studies have analysed the characteristics of patients using this technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS An observational, descriptive, transversal, multicentre study was conducted on patients between 1 month and 16 years of age dependent on domiciliary mechanical ventilation. RESULTS A total of 163 patients with a median age of 7.6 years from 17 Spanish hospitals were studied. The main reasons for DMV were neuromuscular disorders. The median age at beginning of DMV was 4.6 years. Almost three-quarters (71.3%) received non-invasive ventilation. Patients depending on invasive ventilation were younger, started DMV at an earlier age, and had more hours of mechanical ventilation per day. The large majority (80.9%) used DMV during sleep time only, and 11.7% during the whole day. Only 3.4% of patients had external health assistance. Just under half (48.2%) were being followed up in specific DMV or multidisciplinary clinics. Almost three-quarters (72.1%) of patients attended school (42.3% with adapted schooling). Only 47.8% of school patients had specific caregivers in their schools. CONCLUSIONS DMV in children is used in a very heterogeneous group of patients, and in an important number of patients it is started before the third year of life. Despite there being a significant proportion of patients with a high dependency on DMV, few families receive specific support at home or at school, and health care surveillance is variable and poorly coordinated.</dc:description>
