<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION This study aims to perform a descriptive analysis of the usage patterns of migraine prophylactic medications by various neurologists in our setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS The first preventive treatment prescribed for migraine in patients not associated to other diagnoses of primary headache was recorded in three outpatient neurology clinics and one headache specific clinic. RESULTS A total of 235 prophylactic treatments out of 669 patients were initiated. The patients were aged 37 +/- 12 years (mean +/- standard deviation) and 84.45% were women. Migraines with aura accounted for 18.9% of migraines. By order of frequency, the prophylactic treatments administered were topiramate (43%), beta-blockers (18%), flunaricine (17%), amitriptyline (14%), selective serotonin reputake inhibitors (6%) and others (2%). Beta-blockers and flunaricine were used much more frequently in men (29.7% and 27% versus 15.9% and 14.4%, respectively) and antidepressants were used more in women (21.87% versus 5.4%). The most frequently used antidepressant was amitriptyline, and its use increases with the age of the patient, it being the most frequently used treatment in over 60-year-old patient group. CONCLUSIONS At present, topiramate has become the first preventive treatment option for migraine in our setting, especially in young women. There is greater variability in the choice of an alternative treatment. Amitriptyline is the first choice within the antidepressants and is almost exclusively prescribed in women with migraine and elderly age.</dc:description>
