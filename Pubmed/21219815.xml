<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is characterized by the association among arterial or venous thrombosis, recurrent pregnancy loss, thrombocytopenia and the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. Antiphospholipid antibody-related thrombosis seems to constitute a significant proportion of childhood thrombosis. We present the case of an adolescent female with non-ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction secondary to APS. CLINICAL CASE we present the case of a 14-year old female with a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura whose symptomatology initiated with oppressive chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis and nausea. During the physical exam she had tachycardia, accentuation of the second heart sound, a mesosystolic murmur in the pulmonary focus and pulmonary rales. Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment depression in anterior and lateral wall and positive enzymatic curve for infarction. Clinical study reported anterolateral and apical infarction, ostium secundum atrial septal defect and APS. CONCLUSIONS many studies have demonstrated the diversity of clinical features associated with APS in children and teenagers including deep venous thrombosis, stroke, digital ischemia, pulmonary vasoocclusive disease and, more rarely, acute myocardial infarction. In pediatric patients with acute myocardial infarction we must consider the possibility of APS even though coronary thrombotic occlusion is one of the rarest manifestations.</dc:description>
