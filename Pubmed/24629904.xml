<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In the recent years, parents are playing an important role in Pediatric Emergency Department (PED), and wish to be present when invasive procedures (IP) are performed. OBJECTIVES 1) To compare the presence of parents during IP in PED in Spain between 2008 and 2012. 2) To compare the arguments to restrict the presence and problems arising from this, and 3) To determine whether the views of health personnel have changed on this subject. METHODOLOGY A descriptive multicenter comparative study was conducted in 2008 and 2012. A total of 42 questionaires were sent by email to PED managers, with the responding hospitals being included in the 2 periods of the study. RESULTS A total of 22 hospitals participated in the study. The presence of parents in the PED increased between 2008 and 2012 for all IP, significantly in the blood test and urine catheterization. In 2012, managers state that children are not so nervous, and anxiety of the parents and staff fear of a poorer performance, as an argument to restrict family presence. There were few problems during the 2 periods, with the poor behavior of the children decreasing. According to managers, the opinion of health personnel has not changed in the last four years. CONCLUSIONS The presence of parents during the IP in the PED has increased in the last four years, although the presence is low for more invasive procedures. Managers argue the presence of fewer behavior problems to restrict family presence. The opinion of the staff has not changed in the last four years, although more studies are required on this issue.</dc:description>
