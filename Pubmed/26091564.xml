<dc:description xml:lang="en">Some patients with autoimmune liver disease have characteristics of cholestasis, as well as of autoimmune hepatitis. Despite the fact that this is a relatively frequent clinical condition seen in referral centers for liver diseases, there is little evidence as regards the clinical management of these syndromes due to their low prevalence and the lack of standardized definitions and diagnostic criteria. This is relevant, given that published studies report that there is a lower therapeutic response and poorer outcome in patients with overlap syndrome than in those presenting solely with autoimmune hepatitis. Whether overlap syndromes are distinct entities or the presence of 2 concurrent diseases is still a subject of debate. They should be suspected in autoimmune hepatitis patients that present with signs of cholestasis, as it is known that overlap behavior tends to be more aggressive, with higher rates of cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation. Treatment response is also poorer and should be directed at the predominant component. Standardized definitions are necessary so that these syndromes can be studied in controlled clinical trials.</dc:description>
