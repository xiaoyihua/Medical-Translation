<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and safety of photovaporization of the prostate with Greenlight HPS laser as major outpatient surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective study was conducted of a cohort of 50 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia who underwent photovaporization with Greenlight HPS laser (120 W) as major outpatient surgery from May 2008 to February 2009. Inclusion criteria were moderate to severe obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms (IPSS of 10 or more and flowmetry with Qmax of 10 ml/sec or less due to benign prostatic hyperplasia with prostate volume less than 80 ml. Preoperative assessment included IPSS; flowmetry; physical examination; ultrasound examination of the kidney, bladder, and prostate (retropubic and transrectal); and measurement of postvoid residue and PSA levels. Surgical data were assessed (vaporization time, operating time, joules, complications during and after surgery). Patients were followed up 1 and 3 months after surgery (PSA, flow rate, IPSS questionnaire). RESULTS No patient admission or readmission was required, and bladder catheter was successfully removed from all patients within 24 hours of surgery. Mean patient age was 66.75 years. Mean prostate volume was 44.5 ml (SD + or - 21). Twenty patients (40%) had prior catheterization. Qmax and postvoid values significantly improved. Major complications at follow-up included voiding syndrome-urgency in 6 patients (12%) and mild transient hematuria in 3 patients (6%). CONCLUSIONS Photovaporization of the prostate with Greenlight HPS laser may be safely and successfully performed as a major outpatient surgical procedure, which undoubtedly represents a change in care, for surgical treatment of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia.</dc:description>
