<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the frequencies of various eye and/or orbital disorders by ultrasound examination in patients with ocular trauma. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective and descriptive study was conducted on 100 patients with ocular trauma treated in the Conde de Valenciana Institute from March to November 2014. Ultrasound examination was performed primarily using ultrasound B mode, with standardised A mode only used as correlation method. Age, gender, type of trauma, and various ultrasound findings were recorded. RESULTS Ocular trauma was more frequent in men (83%) compared to women (17%). The left eye was affected in 55%, and right eye in 45%, with 55% being open traumas and 45% blunt traumas. Most cases were young patients with a mean age of 33.7 years, with the group between 41 to 50 years being the most affected. Among the most frequent injuries found was the vitreous haemorrhage (45%) and posterior hyaloid detachment (38%), followed by retinal detachment (32%), and choroidal detachment (18%). CONCLUSION Ultrasound remains as the investigation method of choice in patients with ocular trauma, since it is a simple, cheap and non-invasive study, and can be very useful in providing diagnostic and prognostic information. This study demonstrated that trauma is more common in young men, with vitreous haemorrhage as the most common finding.</dc:description>
