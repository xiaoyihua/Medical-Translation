<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE The aim of this study is to find out the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGB) after the diagnosis of portal cavernoma in children, and to investigate several potential risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed retrospectively 13 cases of portal cavernoma and estimated the risk of UGB with the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. We calculated the incidence rate of the sample and the number of haemorrhages per year for each patient individually. From the moment of the diagnosis various parameters were recorded: age, platelets, leukocytes, hemoblobin, hematocrit, prothrombin time and number of bleedings. The relation between these parameters and the risk of bleeding was assessed with the Cox analysis. RESULTS The patients were followed for a median period of 7.1 years. 10 patients (77%) presented at least 1 episode of UGB after the diagnosis. The median survival time until the first haemorrhage was 314 days. After the diagnosis the incidence rate of the sample was 0.43 episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding per person-year. The number of individual bleedings per person had a range of 0-2.2 episodes per year. CONCLUSIONS There is very few data about the risk of bleeding in children with portal cavernoma. In our sample, we found out an incidence rate of 0.43 and a median survival time of 314 days until the first episode of bleeding after the diagnosis, but we were not able to find a statistically significant association between the studied variables and the risk of bleeding.</dc:description>
