<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hydrocephalus is a common problem in Neurosurgery and Neurology. The usual treatment is the installation of a Ventricular Peritoneal Shunt (VPS). Infection is the most frequent and serious complication. With the aim to identify risk factors associated with infection in the post surgery of VPS in pediatric patients from Carlos Van Buren Hospital a case control study between 1998-2008 was done. Cases were patients with VPS infection reported to the Department of Nosocomial Infections. Results in contingency tables were analyzed to determine Odds Ratio. 264 surgical procedures were studied in 207 patients with 53 infections reported in 26 patients. Significant risk factors were: history of prior ventriculitis, VPS dysfunction and prior external ventricular shunt, concurrent infections at the time of surgery and a neurosurgeon without the specialty of pediatric neurosurgery. We concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis was not an important factor in preventing infection and the neurosurgeon experience is relevant to the development of VPS infections.</dc:description>
