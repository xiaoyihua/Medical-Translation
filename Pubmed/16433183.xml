<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The epidemiological importance and ecological characteristics of triatomines were investigated in a Chagas disease focus in Talaigua Nuevo, Bolivar Province. OBJECTIVE To describe and correlate the ecological characteristics of triatomines in a Chagas disease focus. MATERIALS AND METHODS Triatomines were collected in 300 domiciles located in the urban zone of Talaigua Nuevo. This included inspection of microhabitats in and around the domestic environment, and also wine palms, woodpiles and firewood. RESULTS Among the 103 triatomines collected, four species were identified--Triatoma maculata, Eratyrus cuspidatus, Panstrongylus geniculatus, and Rhodnius prolixus. T. maculata was the most abundant species (92.23%). The majority (93%) were collected in the intradomiciliary environment. CONCLUSION Individuals of T. maculata naturally infected with Trypanosoma were recorded for the first time in Bolivar Province. The distribution range of P. geniculatus and R. prolixus was expanded. Using a multiple correspondence analysis, no relationship was discerned between the house type and occurrence of triatomines.</dc:description>
