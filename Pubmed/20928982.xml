<dc:description xml:lang="en">Warfarin is the most utilized oral anticoagulant for the long term prophylaxes of thrombosis. Its use has been increased as new clinical conditions, capable of leading to thrombosis, have been detected. Due to the special characteristics of warfarin, such as the variability of doses for each individual, the narrow margin between adequate and inadequate doses, interaction with multiple pharmaceutical products, interference of its action by vitamin K present in the diet and the possibility of hemorrhagic complications or thrombotic recurrence, this drug requires a very careful dosage and strict laboratory and clinical monitoring. Despite being in the market for more than de fifty years and its many disadvantages, warfarin has not been substituted for the new oral anticoagulants. In 1999, warfarin was positioned eleventh on the list of the most used medicines in the world.</dc:description>
