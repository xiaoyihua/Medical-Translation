<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Establishing an association between food safety and nutritional status in pregnant women in Cartagena. METHODOLOGY This was a cross-sectional study, using a sample of 413 pregnant women living in urban areas who were affiliated to healthcare-providing companies in Cartagena. A 95 % confidence level, 5 % error and 0.41 prevalence were used. they were stratified by proportional allocation; nutritional status was identified by anthropometric indicators plotted on a Rosso-Mardones nomogram and food safety was determined by a national survey of the situation. Stata 9.2 statistical software was used for a descriptive analysis of the data using frequencies, percentages, averages and standard deviations. The odds ratio (OR)* and p &lt;0.05 significance level were estimated in bivariate analysis. RESULTS Mean age was 24.3 years-old, 72.2 % were living with a partner and 52 % belonged to stratum 1; it was determined that 70.2 % had food safety. Regarding nutritional status, it was observed that 42 % had maintained appropriate weight during pregnancy. Food safety was not associated with nutritional status (OR 0.8; 0.5-1.3 95 %CI). CONCLUSION A high percentage of pregnant women had altered nutritional status, tending towards deficit or towards increase reported as having food safety. This may have been because this study assessed food safety in relation to even though the pregnant women may have had food available, this did not guarantee that they consumed it in suitable quantities and/or quality, such aspects not having been evaluated in this study.</dc:description>
