<dc:description xml:lang="en">From jan '82 to jun '91 were done 3701 colonoscopic procedures. Of these, we arrived to cecum in 283 patients (pat) (51.1%) (male: 175 pat; female: 108 pat) in the first six months after the diagnostic of the colorectal cancer (CRC). The localization of the primary CRC was: rectum: 17.7%; left colon: 37.8% and right colon: 44.5%. 105 synchronical polyps (p) were seen in 87 pat (30.7%): 61 pat with 1p; 16 pat with 2 p and 10 pat with 3 p. Adenomas: 50/105 p (56.19%). Early cancer was histologically confirmed in 11/105 p (11/59 p adenomas). The distribution of early were 5/11 in the same colon segment ant 6/11 in the different colon segment. 1 pat has 3 early cancer. Synchronic advanced colorectal cancer (ACC) was seen in 9 pat (M/F = 2/1). All of these in different segments. In conclusion, the high frequency of the premalignant (adenomas) an malignant (early and advanced cancer) lesions, and the high risk of these in different segments of the large bowel, shows the colonoscopy is the most efficient method in the detection of the synchronical lesions of the colorectal cancer.</dc:description>
