<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Classical treatment of advanced heart failure is mainly based on the intravenous administration of inotropic drugs and vasodilators. Phosphodiesterase-III inhibitors, drugs whose effectiveness is not affected for the beta-receptor downgrading, may be particularly helpful in patients with severe heart failure refractory to conventional treatment with dopamine, dobutamine and/or nitroprusside. PATIENTS AND METHODS We have analysed the hemodynamic effects of milrinone in 13 patients (11 men, 2 women, mean age 55 +/- 12 years) with advanced heart failure resistant to dopamine, dobutamine and/or nitroprusside. Basally, before milrinone was administered, mean cardiac index and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were 1.9 +/- 0.4 l/min/m2 and 25 +/- 6 mmHg, respectively. Milrinone was administered intravenously with a initial dose of 50 micrograms/kg over 10 minutes and followed by and infusion of 0.75 micrograms/kg/min over 6 hours. RESULTS During milrinone administration cardiac index and stroke volume index significantly increased (40% and 28%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance indexes significantly decreased (17% and 30%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05). Mean right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure also decreased (36% and 20%, respectively), but differences did not reach statistical significance. Milrinone was well tolerated and no patient presented serious side-effects. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that in patients with advanced heart failure refractory to conventional treatment with dopamine, dobutamine and/or nitroprusside, the addition of milrinone significantly improves parameters of systolic function.</dc:description>
