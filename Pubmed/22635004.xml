<dc:description xml:lang="en">Definitions of healthcare promotion were examined from the theory of knowledge regarding its ontological and epistemological aspects as considered by several paradigms. Three-phase periodisation was used. The first distancing regarding the positivist paradigm and healthcare promotion through definitions of public health was made during the background phase (1920-1973). The promotion of healthcare acquired its own identity and became explicit policy in the midst of scenarios involving the confluence of paradigms during the foundational phase (1974-1986). Positivist and non-positivist paradigms became broadly articulated during the consolidation phase (1987-2008), becoming extended to methodological aspects.</dc:description>
