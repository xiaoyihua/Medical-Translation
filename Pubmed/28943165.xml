<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To review the radio-pathologic features of symptomatic breast cancers not detected at digital mammography (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of 169 lesions from symptomatic patients with breast cancer that were studied with DM, DBT, ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR). We identified occult lesions (true false negatives) in DM and DBT. Clinical data, density, US and MR findings were analyzed as well as histopathological results. RESULTS We identified seven occult lesions in DM and DBT. 57% (4/7) of the lesions were identified in high-density breasts (type c and d), and the rest of them in breasts of density type b. Six carcinomas were identified at US and MR (BI-RADS 4 masses); the remaining lesion was only identified at MR. The tumor size was larger than 3cm at MRI in 57% of the lesions. All tumors were ductal infiltrating carcinomas, six of them with high stromal proportion. According to molecular classification, we found only one triple-negative breast cancer, the other lesions were luminal-type. We analyzed the tumor margins of two resected carcinomas that were not treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, both lesions presented margins that displaced the adjacent parenchyma without infiltrating it. CONCLUSION Occult breast carcinomas in DM and DBT accounted for 4% of lesions detected in patients with symptoms. They were mostly masses, all of them presented the diagnosis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma (with predominance of the luminal immunophenotype) and were detected in breasts of density type b, c and d.</dc:description>
