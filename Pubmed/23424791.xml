<dc:description xml:lang="en">The optimization of the PCR conditions for amplification of the gene coding for the 70 kDa (HSp70) heat shock protein as well as the analysis of the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were carried out. DNA from a reference strain of Leishmania mexicana was used as template. Analytical sensitivity and specificity, and reproducibility of PCR using DNA from L. mexicana, Lamazonensis, L. guyanensis and L. lainsoni were determined. A 1.3 kp band was obtained, which confirmed gene amplification. The band patterns derived from Haelll enzyme digestion allowed differentiating several species. L. guyanensis and L. lainsoni were different from each other, while L. mexicana and L. amazonensis, which shared a common pattern, were different from the other two species. Analytical sensitivity and specificity were adequate. The enzymatic restriction of the PCR product made it possible to differentiate Leishmania spp. from T. cruzi. The feasibility of identifying and typifying species from the American continent through PCR-RFLP/Hsp70 and of using enzymatic restriction of amplified product to distinguish Leishmania spp. from Trypanosornma cruzi was shown. This was the first step in implementing these molecular methods in the reference laboratory of the Institute.</dc:description>
