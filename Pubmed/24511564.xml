<dc:description xml:lang="en">Personal ombudsman (PO) is an innovative new service that came out of the Swedish psychiatric reform in 1995. It has later become well known all over the world in connection with the UN Convention on the Rights for Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), as it is one of few concrete examples of supported decision-making (article 12 of the convention). A PO is a professional, highly skilled person, who works to 100 % on the commission of his client only. One organisation that runs such a service is PO-Sk√•ne, which is owned by the user association RSMH together with the family association IFS.</dc:description>
