<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Neuropathic pain results from injury or impairment of the nervous system manifested by pain syndrome. Experimental models have been used to study its effects and how to suppress these. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and anticonvulsant (AC) have been used for treatment. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the antihyperanalgesic efficiency of intraperitoneal (IP) chlorimipramine (CIP) vs IP phenytoine (DFH) for induced neuropathic pain in an experimental animal model. METHODS After making a surgical ligature of the sciatic nerve in the right leg of 18 male rats, the time of withdrawal of both claws immersed in hot (45 degrees C) and cold water (10 degrees C) was measured during a four week period before and after IP CIP, DFH, or placebo administered in a double blind study. RESULTS Significant statistical differences were observed in the time of withdrawal with CIP as compared with DFH and when both groups were compared with placebo (as tested by the paw immersion in hot water). When the thermal stimulus was cold water, an increase of the time of withdrawal was seen with DFH. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that CIP and FS are both effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain in an animal model, as well as for the treatment of secondary hiperalgesia.</dc:description>
