<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe a case of Castleman's disease presenting as a retroperitoneal mass, with special reference to the differential diagnosis from other retroperitoneal lesions. The histological features, variants, clinical manifestations, etiopathogenesis and treatment of Castleman's disease are reviewed. METHODS A 64-year-old male presented with voiding symptoms and hypogastric pain. An ultrasound scan showed a 5 x 6 cm mass located behind the bladder and above the prostate, which was confirmed by an abdomino-pelvic CT scan. RESULTS Retroperitoneal sarcoma was suspected and the mass was resected. The histopathological analysis showed giant lymphoid hyperplasia (vascular hyaline variant of Castleman's disease). CONCLUSIONS Retroperitoneal Castleman's disease is a lymphoproliferative disorder with two well-defined histological types and a mixed variant. Although this lesion is frequently localized to the mediastinum (71%), extrathoracic lesions have been described. Definitive diagnosis is based on the postoperative pathological findings.</dc:description>
