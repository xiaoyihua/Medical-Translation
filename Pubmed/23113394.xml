<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyze the fertility survey made in a cohort of adults operated on as children for cryptorchidism and for whom clinical and surgical data is available and who were studied 10 years ago by spermiogram and hypophyseal axis. METHODS A fertility survey including data on style of life and work conditions was sent to the homes of 278 adult patients operated on for cryptorchidism. The 94 surveys received (33.8% of those sent) were analyzed using the SPSS 15.0, carrying out a descriptive and analytic study. We consider persons who achieve pregnancy within a maximum of 12 months with regular sexual activity without the use of contraceptives as having normal fertility. RESULTS A total of 53 cases of those surveyed (56.4%) attempted to have children, 44 (83.1%) being successful. A total of 34 patients (64.2%) were considered fertile with a mean time of 4.15 months to become pregnant. Nineteen patients (35.8%) had attempted to become parents for more than 12 months and only 10 achieved it (18.9%), 5% in a natural way, 2 with ovulation treatment and 3 by in vitro fertilization, with a mean of 26.8 months. There was no success in becoming parents in 9 cases (16.9%). There are no significant differences between fertilization and localization in laterality of the testicle, age at time of surgery and density on spermiogram. There are significant differences between natural paternity and unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidia. CONCLUSIONS There is a greater proportion of unilateral cryptorchidias in the group that was successful in having children. We need to increase the number of those surveyed in order to draw significant conclusions in regards to fertility and other clinical situations.</dc:description>
