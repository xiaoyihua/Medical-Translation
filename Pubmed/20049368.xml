<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Determine frequency of Eating Disorders and Non-Specific Eating Disorders and pathological behaviour in obese patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study includes fifty-four obese patients (BMI &gt; or = 30) consecutively attended at the Nutrition Section of the University Hospital of Vigo. Aged 37.5 +/- 11.1. Range 18-58, 45 female and 9 male. CONTROL GROUP 15 adult normal-weight subjects (11 female, 4 male), aged 35,3 +/- 9,2 años. Frequency of Eating Disorders was determined by a lifestyle clinical interview and the following questionnaires: Eating Attitudes Test 26 (EAT26), Bulimic Investigatory Test Edimburgh (BITE) and Questionnaire Eating Weight Patterns Revised (QEWP-R). RESULTS Twelve out of 54 (20.6%) patients showed Pathological Behavior, while 5 (4.1%) and 3 (2.5%) had Non- Specific Eating Disorders and Classic Eating Disorders respectively, whereas in the control group non subjects showed psychological anomalies. When we divided obese patients by the degree of obesity, differences in the frequencies of the Eating Disorders was no observed. CONCLUSIONS In our obese patients, Pathological Behavior was the most frequent finding followed for Non-Specific Eating Disorders and Classic Eating Disorders.</dc:description>
