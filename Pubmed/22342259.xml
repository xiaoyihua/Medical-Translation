<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The application of the laparoscopic technique in acute cholecystitis is still subject to controversy. The aim of this study is to asses the applicability, safety, benefits and complications of the laparoscopic approach in patients with acute cholecystitis, as well as the development of this technique in the emergency surgery department of a tertiary hospital, compared to laparotomy. MATERIAL AND METHOD The study consisted of 354 patients with acute cholecystitis syndromes operated either by open or laparoscopic surgery, during the years 2006 to 2009. RESULTS The laparoscopic method was used in 253 patients, and 101 by the open route, with the slight majority being male (57.67%) and with a mean age of 62.83 years. The number of laparoscopic cholecystectomies increased from 60% in 2006, to 79% in 2009. The mean hospital stay (including those with and without complications) was shorter using the laparoscopic approach, compared to open surgery (showing a difference of approximately 6 days). The postoperative complications in laparoscopy during the four years studied decreased from 21.42 to 11.3%. The local and general complications were significantly associated with time since the start of the acute symptoms and the surgery, as well as the histopathological state of the gall bladder. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic approach continues to play an increasing role in the treatment of this disease, becoming the main surgical option in our hospital.</dc:description>
