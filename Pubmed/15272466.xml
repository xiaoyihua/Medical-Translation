<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To report the rare case of a patient with a ureteral polyp. METHODS We describe the case of a 55-year-old female patient receiving care at the Celia Sanchez Manduley University Hospital in Manzanillo, Cuba, who was fortuitously diagnosed of a fibroepithelial polyp of the right ureter during the work up and treatment of an ovarian tumor. RESULTS This case is the first of its kind in this hospital after 22 years, which confirms the rarity of ureteral tumors, specifically those of benign etiology. The absence of symptoms, specifically hematuria and pain, does not correspond to the reviewed articles. The chosen treatment was exeresis of the polyp at its base and frozen biopsy, followed by re-establishment of the urinary passage, as various authors recommend. Currently the endoscopical approach is recommended for its multiple advantages. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that this disease is very rare, may have a symptomatic course and the treatment of choice is surgery with very good results.</dc:description>
