<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia among rural pregnant women in Valladolid, Yucatan, Mexico. MATERIALS AND METHODS A descriptive study was carried out from March to May 2006. A clinical-epidemiological survey, a complete blood count test and a ferritin test were applied to a non-random sample conformed by 51 rural pregnant women. RESULTS Thirty five point two percent of the 51 pregnant women studied presented anaemia, which was more frequent during the second and third trimester, 25.6% of which were adolescents. Abnormal iron profile was found in 41% of the women, 30% (9/51) presented iron-deficiency anaemia which was more frequent in the third trimester. The women with iron-deficiency anaemia had had an average of four pregnancies. No significant difference was found between multiparity and anaemia (square Chi, p = 9.29). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of iron-deficient anaemia was 17.64% in this group, more frequent during the third trimester. The hematological alterations were more frequent in multipara women. In a quarter of the sample, pregnancy occurred during adolescence; two events that need greater amounts of iron. The creation of nutritional programs since childhood and the incorporation of ferritin in prenatal care is fundamental for the adequate development and security of both mother and child.</dc:description>
