<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of long-term high level physical exertion on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Ninety-one young athletes, 70 men and 21 women, who practiced sports such as running, swimming, rowing, boxing and soccer, were studied. The control group included 101 healthy subjects, 77 men and 24 women, with sedentary life style. The mean plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) (p = 0.04), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p = 0.04) and the atherogenic index (p = 0.01) were lower, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (p &lt; 0.005) significantly higher in male athletes than in controls. Mean plasma lipids and lipoproteins concentrations were not significantly different in sportswomen when compared with their controls. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C levels, were lower in male and female athletes of the five sport disciplines than in sedentary controls; however, only hypercholesterolemia (p &lt; 0.05) and the atherogenic index (p &lt; 0.01) were statistically different. These results, consistent with data previously published, show that low plasma levels of TG and high levels of HDL-C characterizes the athletes who practice an aerobic physical activity; additionally, in male athletes we found that long-term exercise appears to reduce LDL-C plasma levels. This latter finding agree with most, but not all, studies in the literature. We conclude that athletes have a lipid profile that may be protective against the development of atherosclerosis.</dc:description>
