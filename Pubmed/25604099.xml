<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To determine the prevalence of blindness and visual impairment in Honduras, its causes and the response by the health services to growing demand. METHODS A cross-sectional population study was conducted between June and December 2013 using the standard methodology of the Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness. A random sample survey was done in 63 clusters of 50 individuals aged â‰¥ 50, representative of the country as a whole. Visual acuity (VA) was assessed using a Snellen eye chart, and the condition of the lens and posterior pole was examined by direct ophthalmoscopy. Cataract surgical coverage was calculated and an assessment made of its quality, the causes of VA &lt; 20/60 and the barriers to accessing surgical treatment. RESULTS A total of 2 999 people were examined (95.2% of the forecast total). Blindness prevalence was 1.9% (confidence interval of 95%: 1.4-2.4%) and 82.2% of these cases were avoidable. The main causes of blindness were unoperated cataracts (59.2%) and glaucoma (21.1%). Uncorrected refraction error was the main cause of severe (19.7%) and moderate (58.6%) visual impairment. Cataract surgical coverage was 75.2%. 62.5% of the eyes operated for cataracts achieved a VA &gt; 20/60 with available correction. The main barriers against cataract surgery were cost (27.7%) and the lack of availability or difficulty of geographical access to the treatment (24.6%). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of blindness and visual impairment in Honduras is similar to that of other Latin American countries. 67% of cases of blindness could be resolved by improving the response capacity of the ophthalmological services, especially of cataract surgery, improving optician services and incorporating eye care in primary health care.</dc:description>
