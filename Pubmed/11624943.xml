<dc:description xml:lang="en">The main sources of information used by the author for this study dealing with ideas on contagion prior to the work of Pasteur were French treatises on general pathology. These range from that of Chomel (1817) to those of the 1860, by which time Pasteur was studying the micro-organism which cause fermentations. The main aim is to analize how the conceptual framework which permited the constitution of the microbian theory of infectious disease became established. The authors studies provide a series of responses to the problem of contagious disease which, although different to the old theory or animated contagion, come very close in some aspects to those responses that arose later towards the end of the century.</dc:description>
