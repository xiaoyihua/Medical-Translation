<dc:description xml:lang="en">Research by a number of international organisations indicates that world demand for red meat protein is set to increase significantly in the coming years. However, faced with the risk of infectious animal diseases and zoonoses--factors that could limit the growth of this production sector--the fight against livestock diseases must continue, especially against those that affect food safety or pose a threat to human life. The use of vaccination to prevent infectious animal diseases is of key importance, not only because it helps to control and effectively eradicate infectious livestock diseases, but also because it makes it possible to introduce new technologies for intensive or semi-intensive production, to protect the environment, to care for animal welfare and to guarantee the safety of animal-derived foodstuffs. As part of their professional culture, livestock producers have come to fully appreciate the advantages of using vaccination to prevent disease rather than curative measures, which are more costly to implement and in some cases not very effective. The control of anthrax and rabies by means of effective vaccines was a factor in the widespread development of livestock in Argentina and other parts of Latin America. Recent results in the control and eradication of foot and mouth disease have made producers even more convinced of the merits of this technology. Animal disease prevention has proven to be highly conducive to the production of healthy foodstuffs. It is the responsibility of international organisations to draw up appropriate regulations to protect trade, supply safe and healthy products and prevent the application of unjustified non-tariff measures.</dc:description>
