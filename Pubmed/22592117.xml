<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION This study describes very low birth weight (VLBW) infant morbidity and mortality in Basque Country and Navarra neonatal units between the years 2001-2006, and evaluates the factors that affect the mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS A descriptive observational study of a cohort of 1,318 VLBW infants in neonatal units in five Basque Country and Navarra hospitals between 2001 and 2006. A total of 37 variables included in EuroNeoNet database were collected as regards, perinatal risk and protective factors, demographic characteristics, length of stay, interventions, morbidity and mortality. RESULTS A total of 94% of pregnant women received prenatal care and 78.7% antenatal steroids. In both cases there was a significant increase during the period studied. A total of 42% of pregnancies were multiple and in 63% delivery was by Caesarean section. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia statistically significantly decreased from 20% to 15%. The incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage grade III or IV was 7.5% and for periventricular leukomalacia it was 3.1%. Vertical infection was diagnosed in 4% of infants and sepsis or late meningitis in 25%, necrotizing enterocolitis in 9% and patent ductus arteriosus in 14% of the infants. The prophylactic or therapeutic treatment with indometacin or ibuprofen decreased significantly during the study. The overall rate of total, late and first day neonatal mortality was almost constant during this period of time. Nevertheless, the early neonatal mortality showed a decreasing trend and with a significant difference between sexes, being higher in males. CONCLUSION This population-based study provides valuable information on clinical outcomes in NICUs, and may help in planning strategies to improve health care quality, and to reduce the morbidity and mortality in these neonates at high risk.</dc:description>
