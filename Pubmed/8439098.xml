<dc:description xml:lang="en">A descriptive and retrospective epidemiological study of measles vaccinations was realized. This study involved 112 children hospitalized in Valencia (Spain) for measles during the period from January 1983 to December 1988. We compared children that had received vaccination and those children that had not. Statistically significant differences were observed in regards to the age of the child (p &lt; 0.025) and the year in which the cases were diagnosed (p &lt; 0.05). The evolution of measles in Spain and in the United States shows the need for revaccinations, as well as the need to augment the coverage of vaccinations in order to eradicate this disease.</dc:description>
