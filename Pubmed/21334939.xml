<dc:description xml:lang="en">Salmonellosis is usually related to food poisoning however other possible causes such as reptile exposure are often unrecognised. The aim of this study is to describe a case of salmonella infection related to pet exposure. After a salmonella infection in an eleven month old baby was reported to our public health agency, an epidemiological investigation took place. Despite all family members had had clinical symptoms suggesting salmonella infection none of the microbiological analysis was positive. At the infant's home they had an exotic pet: a turtle. We found out that Salmonella was present in a sample of water of its aquarium. Both profiles of S. parathyphi B (from the infant and from the aquaria samples) were identical. Exotic pets are not often recognized as Salmonella infection carriers and vehicles in Europe. As described in this study, an inaccurate hygiene after touching turtles or its habitat can lead to spread salmonella infection in humans. When investigating Salmonella infection exposure to exotic pets has to be addressed. People that have or wish to have a turtle or any other reptile should be informed about its risks. Nursing role is most important in the surveillance and study of such cases.</dc:description>
