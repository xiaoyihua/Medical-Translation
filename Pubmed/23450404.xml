<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Surgical site infections (SSI) represent an inherent risk after surgical procedures associated both to the surgical procedure and to the patient clinical conditions. AIM To analyze in an integrative review the studies related to patient readmission due to SSI. MATERIAL AND METHOD The review was carried out by LILACS, CINHAL, MEDLINE and COCHRANE databases and articles published from 1966 to 2010 were selected. RESULTS It was analyzed 13 studies classified as transversal (7), cohort (4) and longitudinal (2). Few studies analyzed only the readmissions related to the SSI. Time to define the readmission ranged from 28 to 90 days after surgery and studies related to orthopedic procedures were more frequent. The ISS readmission rates were lower than 5%. The main aetiological agents isolated from ISS were Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. CONCLUSION Monitoring readmissions due to SSI could contribute to dimension the occurrence of ISS post-discharge, once about half of the SSI post-discharge was diagnosed at the readmission moment.</dc:description>
