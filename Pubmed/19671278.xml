<dc:description xml:lang="en">Worldwide, the technological revolution is taking place, but the human aspect of health care demonstrates that medical personnel often avoid the responsibility for the emotional care of their patients. This is not a recent point of view. In many ways, during the 19th century, Mexican physicians were outspoken about the problems in regard to the manner in which care of sick persons was carried out. They were certain that scientific progress was the origin of medical dehumanization, frequently forgetting that physicians were treating sensitive and intelligent persons and, therefore, must adjust their behavior in accordance with their patients. Because of this situation, 19th century physicians were invited to share a list of responsibilities and duties to patients, among their professional colleagues as well as among government authorities. In particular, the philosophies of three health professionals were analyzed, Francisco Flores (1855-1931), Porfirio Parra (1854-1912) and Adrián de Garay (1860-192?), in regard to how the practice of medicine should be exercised and that the underlying ethical and moral principles must always be present.</dc:description>
