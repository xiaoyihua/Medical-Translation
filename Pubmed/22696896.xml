<dc:description xml:lang="en">Factors associated with adiposity in normal weight female adolescents with adequate and high percent body fat: elaborating a risk model. This study was carried out to evaluate the factors associated with adiposity in normal weight adolescents presenting appropriate or high percent body fat, who attended the public schools in Viçosa county-Minas Gerais/Brazil. A total of 118 female adolescents at age range from 14 to 19 years and have already presented the menarche were evaluated. The adolescents were divided into 2 groups: G1 with high percent body fat and G2 with appropriate percent body fat. The following variables were evaluated: anthropometric, body composition, lifestyle and the family history of non-communicable chronic diseases. In subsample, the basal energy consumption was determined by indirect calorimetry. The G1-grouped adolescents showed higher values for most anthropometric and body composition variables (p &lt; 0.001). No differences were observed (p &gt; 0.05) for basal metabolism and metabolism of lean body mass, smoking habit, total energy consumption and protein and lipid as well between groups. When comparing the physical activity level, the G1 adolescents spent more time with 1-level sedentary activities whereas the G2 ones showed higher total caloric consumption with daily activities (p &lt; 0.001). According to risk factors under analysis, the variables related to lifestyle, as distinguishing the use of sweeteners (OR = 13.47), provided higher contribution to excessive adiposity in the normal weight adolescents. The detailed analysis of the body composition as well as the risk factors associated with excessive body fat makes possible the early diagnosis and the development of more appropriate intervention means.</dc:description>
