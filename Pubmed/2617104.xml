<dc:description xml:lang="en">The level of alcoholism in Chile and its variations between 1952 and 1982 are studied by means of the Jellinek Method. The limitations and bias of the methodology employed are indicated and the results are compared with those of other children studies. The conclusion is that there was an increase in the number of alcoholics and in the alcoholism rate during the period analyzed, with a rate for 1982 70% higher than that for 1952. The efficacy of the policy for the prevention of alcoholism adopted in the period under study is called in question by the results presented.</dc:description>
