<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Duplications of the alimentary tract are a group of rare malformations occurring in about 1/5,000 live births. These may be either spherical or tubular and may communicate with the intestinal tract. Duplications of the cecum are very uncommon. CLINICAL CASE A 14-year-old female was admitted to the emergency department with a 1-day history of abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation and abdominal distension. Abdominal examination revealed distension and tenderness around the umbilicus. Plain abdominal radiography showed dilated colon. The patient underwent surgical management with diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus. Laparotomy revealed spherical duplication from the cecum. Hemicolectomy was done and alimentary continuity was restored by end-to-end anastomosis. Pathological report was a spherical communicated duplication from the cecum (22 × 32 cm). CONCLUSIONS Duplication of the cecum is extremely rare and is seen in 0.4% of duplications of the alimentary tract. The majority of cases (85%) are diagnosed before age 2 years. It is rare at 14 years of age. Diagnosis is difficult and volvulus, intussusception or appendicitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Ultrasonography and tomography are the imaging studies of choice. Plain abdominal x-ray is not specific. Resection of the duplication with restoration of alimentary continuity is the treatment of choice.</dc:description>
