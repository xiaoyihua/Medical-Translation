DESIGN A crossover observation study. SETTING Primary care. Health district. PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS Children under 8 belonging to the marginalized non-gypsy population and children of the same age from the general population. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Less weight and height, deficient compliance with healthy child monitoring, an acceptable level of vaccination (over 80%), excess of acute dermatological and neurological pathology (7.6% against 0% in the general population). 45% of pregnancies were unwanted, with a higher average of siblings and other people living in ordinary or poor-quality housing, which belonged to the grandparents in 50% of cases. Young parents with little training and serious problems of unemployment (60%), drug dependency (33%), alcoholism (23.3%) and delinquency (18.5%). The mother looked after the children by herself in 48% of cases. CONCLUSIONS There is little healthy child monitoring and light undernourishment, but the vaccination coverage is acceptable.
