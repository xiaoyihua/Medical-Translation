<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Informatics is acquiring an increasing relevance in the medical profession. METHODS During the year 1993, a survey was carried out at the medical schools (MS) and postgraduate education centres (PEC) in Epidemiology, Public Health and Health Administration of Spain, on the available computer infrastructure and the teaching activities. The percentages of respondents were 81 at the MS and 100 at the PEC. RESULTS 81% of the MS and 100% of the PEC had a computer laboratory, mainly equipped with personal computers with MS-DOS operating system. The use of general purpose applications was predominant. The number of students using the computer laboratory was very variable (5-300 per day). 48% of the MS organized courses on microcomputer applications. 66% of the MS included subjects related with informatics in the new curricula. CONCLUSIONS Use of computers in the Spanish MS is heterogeneous. Compared with the Nord-American MS, they do not usually use applications of computer-assisted-instruction. The use of the computers at the PEC is much more generalized.</dc:description>
