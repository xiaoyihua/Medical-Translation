<dc:description xml:lang="en">Allergic reactions to food colors have been known since 1958. Reactions to tartrazine, our example, include generalized pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, paresthesias, vomiting, migraine, rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, coughing, asthma attacks and purpura. Many patients who are allergic to antiinflammatory drugs such as acetyl-salicylic acid and indomethacin show cross-reaction to tartrazine. Doses producing these reactions range from minimal amounts up to 750 mg. Symptoms appear after periods of time ranging from minutes to 6 to 14 hours. In view of these facts (some of which represent a threat to the patient's life), additives, colouring matter, etc, do not usually appear in product labels or specifications, or in handbooks or catalogues used in practice. We drew up a list of drugs which may contain food dyes and coloring matter, yellow No. 5. A letter was written to 233 laboratories of which 159 (68%) replied. 72 (45%) in the affirmative and 87 (55%) in the negative, 74 (32%) did not reply.</dc:description>
