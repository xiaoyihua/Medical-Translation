<dc:description xml:lang="en">The association of celiac disease, epilepsy and occipital calcifications with initial clinical manifestations of epilepsy during the first two decades of life with an often progressive and variable course and clinical expression of malabsorption has recently been described. Two cases of celiac disease with occipital calcifications and a presentation with neurologic symptoms in adulthood are reported. The first case is that of a 40-year-old male who presented recurrent and alternating pure brachial monoparesis and later acute abdominal pain following which celiac sprue was diagnosed. The second case is that of a 53-year-old woman diagnosed with celiac sprue 20 years before, presenting permanent myoclonus in the lower limbs which were progressive in severity, ataxic march and generalized tonoclonic seizures. Both patients had bilateral occipital calcifications on CT and celiac disease was demonstrated on biopsy. The first case also showed marked signal alteration in the white matter on MRI. Celiac disease with cerebral calcifications presents also in adulthood with atypical clinical manifestations. Suspicion of celiac disease may be confirmed by non-invasive methods such as antigliadin and antiendomysium antibody determination. CT imaging is characteristic.</dc:description>
