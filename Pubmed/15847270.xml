<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of the urinary symptoms suggestive of overactive bladder (OAB) in Spain based on the International Continence Society (ICS) 2002 consensus criteria as urinary urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. METHODS 1,669 real telephone interviews were conducted to adults aged &gt; or = 40 years. The sample size estimation was made according to the prevalence for OAB described in the Milsom paper stratified by age and gender due to the high variability observed between ranges. Appearance and prevalence of main OAB symptoms, medical diagnostic and therapy due to these symptoms data were collected. RESULTS the sample population was 1669 aged &gt; or = 40 years, 50.6% women and 49.4% men. The overall prevalence of symptoms suggestive of OAB according to the OAB definition from ICS report 2002 was 21.5%, significantly higher in women (25.6%) than men (17.4%)(p&lt;0.05). Adjusting these data to Spanish National Census of year 2000, the prevalence was 19.9%, being higher as well in women (23.6%) than men (115.4%). Urge urinary incontinence and stress urinary incontinence were superior in women (16.7% vs 10.4% and 33.1% vs 7.9% respectively)(p&lt;0.01). Urinary frequency &gt; 8 voids/day was referred by 9.8% of women and 7.9% of men interviewed. 62% of men and 52.4% of women reported they get up at night to void. A total of 52.1% of patients with urinary symptoms suggestive of overactive bladder reported they had consulted a doctor anytime before the interview due to urinary disorders and 16.7% was currently receiving treatment for some of these symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of urinary symptoms suggestive of Overactive Bladder is high in this study, in accordance with data from international studies. Urinary urgency, symptom which defines the pathology, is more prevalent in Spanish women than men. Further studies are needed to better assess OAB impact in the Spanish general population.</dc:description>
