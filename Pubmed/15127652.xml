<dc:description xml:lang="en">Fascioliasis is a trematode, disease of liver and bile ducts of sheep, cattle, and other ruminants throughout the world that is caused by the fluke, Fasciola hepatica. Human infection has been reported in Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, the US, Europe, eastern Africa, Japan and Australia. The parasite's miracidium invades one of the various Lymnaea water snail hosts. Infection results from ingestion of encysted metacercariae attached to raw watercress (Nasturtium officinale). Symptoms recorded from human cases included irregular fever, epigastric pain and abdominal tenderness, obstructive jaundice and leucocytosis with eosinophilea up to 60%. Specific diagnosis is based on recovery of the eggs in the patient's stool or from biliary tract drainage. Treatment is with emetine hydrochloride given intramusculary. Bithionol is given orally at a dosage of 30-50 mg/kg but on alternate days from 10 to 15 doses. Praziquantel is probably effective. Preventive measures include education of the public on mode of transmission of life cycle of the parasite, and dipping fresh watercress into boiling water for a few sec, or drying suspected watercress.</dc:description>
