<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION There are currently several national guidelines on the appropriate empirical use of antibiotics in Spanish children. But, do the Spanish paediatricians use these guidelines when prescribing antimicrobials? MATERIAL AND METHODS A national study from was conducted from April to June 2012 using an on-line questionnaire on the empirical selection of antibiotics in children. An e-mail was sent to paediatrician members of the Spanish Association of Paediatrics (AEP) or its Regional or Paediatric Specialties Societies. Current guidelines and consensus documents were used to determine the appropriateness of the responses. RESULTS A total of 1214 responses were received. Eighty five per cent of the treatments selected by Spanish paediatricians were adjusted to guidelines. The least appropriate responses were obtained in those infectious diseases with no national consensus document at the time of the survey (73% in this case). CONCLUSIONS Spanish paediatricians mainly select empirical antibiotics in accordance with current guidelines. However, there are features that could be improved in our country. The preparing and implementation of national consensus documents on the management of paediatric infectious diseases should be continued. We propose to regularly perform these kinds of surveys, including real prescription studies, and to also extend it to other paediatric specialities, in order to promote appropriateness of use of all the paediatric drugs in our country.</dc:description>
