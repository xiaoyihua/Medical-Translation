<dc:description xml:lang="en">The origins of plant transgenesis are discussed and the experiments that led to the first transgenic plants are analyzed. This process involved a series of actors, practices and interests specific to biotechnology. Consensus about the meaning of fundamental experiments was also at issue here. These events illustrate some of the conflicts related to genetically modified organisms, since scientists had different responses to plant transgenesis at the time of the first experiments, and opinions of the anomalies in those experiments varied. Thus, this article analyzes the interests and interpretations surrounding the first experiments involving transgenic plants.</dc:description>
