<dc:description xml:lang="en">Population aging increases the prevalence of chronic and multiple morbid illnesses and increases the consumption of multiple medications and related problems accordingly. It is reported that &gt;50% of dispensed medications are consumed by older adults; in fact, &gt;80% of older adults take at least one medication daily and 75% do not inform their doctor that they are using unconventional treatments. Appropriate medication prescription to older adults is challenging and it requires the consideration of risks and benefits of the indicated medications, for which clear evidence of their efficacy is often lacking due to the limited inclusion of elderly populations in randomized clinical trials on which clinical guides are based for chronic disease management. However, general guidelines and recommendations must be comprehensively implemented and supported by a multidisciplinary team whenever pharmacological management is provided for older adults. Here we focus on promoting proper prescriptions according to evidence-based recommendations to reduce inappropriate prescriptions, polypharmacy, and self-medication.</dc:description>
