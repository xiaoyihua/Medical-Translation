<dc:description xml:lang="en">Stress is placed on early diagnosis and treatment of dysplasia of the hip, which should ideally be made at birth. The frequency of this condition with dislocation in babies born at Hospital Infantil de Bogotá was 2.7 per 1,000. The frequency of breech presentation in babies with dysplasia of the hip was 20.2%. The average age at the first consultation for this condition was 24 months. The most important clinical signs for the diagnosis are Barlow's and Ortolani's signs and limitation in abduction of the hip. X-ray studies bear an unquestionable importance in the diagnosis; however, a normal film in the newborn does not discard a clinical diagnosis of dysplasia. Examination of the hips should be a routine in all newborn services in the country. A special regulation in this sense should be set. In this campaign, there should be a joint participation of pediatricians, obstetricians and orthopedists. The pediatrician must control the hips of the child, even if they apparently normal, until walking is initiated. The principles of treatment of dysplasia of the hip in all its varieties are described. The main objective of this work is to invite the medical body to participate in a preventive campaign directed to detect dysplasia of the hip in the newborn and to obtain, with an early treatment, the solution to this severe nosological and social problem.</dc:description>
