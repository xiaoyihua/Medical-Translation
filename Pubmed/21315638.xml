<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Intensive Care Units do not adapt to the social and health reality regarding the phenomenon of death and this results in a high degree of dissatisfaction among professional, relatives and patients. The special characteristics of these units give the nursing staff a main roll as carers of critical dying patients. The principal aim of this study is to know the nursing staffs' experiences and attitudes towards the phenomenon of death in the intensive care units. PARTICIPANTS AND METHOD A descriptive qualitative study of phenomenological character was performed. Constant comparison and progressive incorporation of participants was made, using intentional sampling up to data saturation (n=16). The data collection technique used was a semi-structured in-depth interview, which were recorded and literally transcribed. The data collected was verified by the informants and analyzed according to the steps proposed by Taylor-Bogdan. RESULTS The analysis shows 5 thematic categories: death and beliefs, emotional work, environmental factors, decision-making management of death in intensive care units and relationships with relatives. CONCLUSIONS The management model of death in intensive care units focuses on medical intervention and overlooks the opinions of the nurses, relatives and patients. This study shows the contributions that can be provided by the nursing staff in decision making and in the care of the dying patients in these wards.</dc:description>
