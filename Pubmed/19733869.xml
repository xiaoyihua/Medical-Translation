<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE This article describes our experience in the percutaneous technique of expelling bile duct calculi into the duodenum by dilating the papilla with a balloon catheter. MATERIAL AND METHODS We prospectively studied 365 patients (173 men, 192 women; mean age, 75 years; range 26-98) with bile duct calculi (single=213, multiple=152). In 102 cases, residual stones were percutaneously expelled into the duodenum via an indwelling T-tube; in 263 cases, primary (non-residual) stones were expelled from the hepatic or cystic duct through the common bile duct into the duodenum. The technique consisted of dilating the papilla with an angioplasty catheter and expelling the stone into the duodenum with an occlusion balloon; prior mechanical fragmentation was performed in only 48 cases. Percutaneous biliary drainage to the exterior was maintained for 2 to 8 days. RESULTS The procedure was successful on the first attempt in 91.5% of cases and in 94.3% after the second attempt. The procedure failed in 16 cases, mainly due to the large size of the calculi. Residual lithiasis was resolved in 99% of cases and primary (non-residual) lithiasis was resolved in 91%. There were 23 major complications including 6 cases with poor clinical outcome and death (mortality at 30 days was 1.6%). CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous anterograde evacuation of bile duct stones by dilating the papilla with an angioplasty catheter and expelling the stones with an occlusion balloon is effective, nontraumatic, and safe; this procedure maintains the anatomic and functional integrity of the sphincter. When performed by an experienced interventional radiologist, it is a viable alternative to choledochotomy.</dc:description>
