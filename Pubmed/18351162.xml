<dc:description xml:lang="en">Based on different documented cases from the second half of the 14th century, this article describes how women in the city of Valencia frequently participated in the medical care of the people around them, not only relatives but also neighbours, friends and customers. The type and conditions of the care given by these women is analyzed. They are shown to have had a major role in medicine, which was often silenced because they did not form part of the masculine group that practised the art of curing in a more-or-less regulated manner.</dc:description>
