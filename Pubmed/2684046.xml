<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report on a 25-year-old patient diagnosed as having Bourneville tuberous sclerosis with a giant angiomyolipoma 16 X 12 cm. in diameter, and two small angiomyolipomas in the left kidney, multiple asymptomatic angiomas in the right kidney and two 1 cm. diameter angiomas in the liver. The presenting features were intense left-sided abdominal pain of sudden onset, frank hematuria, acute anemic syndrome, nausea and vomiting. Patient work up included x-ray of chest, abdomen, and skull, bilateral renal arteriography and ultrasound were diagnostic of Bourneville tuberous sclerosis with multiple bilateral renal angiomyolipomas. The hematologic and hemodynamic compromise and the almost completely absent intact parenchyma in her left kidney did not permit a conservative surgical procedure and the patient was submitted to a left nephrectomy. The patient had the following characteristic features of Bourneville's disease: epilepsy, intracranial calcifications on CT, sebaceous adenomas on face, fibromas under nails of left hand and foot, bony lesions in the form osteosclerosis and chylous pleural effusion. Her intelligence level was normal and no optic nerve phakomas were observed. The literature on angiomyolipoma and Bourneville's tuberous sclerosis is reviewed. The importance of using ultrasound and CT in combination to diagnose and follow up renal angiomyolipomas is highlighted. Treatment of angiomyolipomas must be based on two parameters: symptoms and size. Symptomatic angiomyolipomas warrant angiographic work up and selective arterial embolization or the most conservative surgical procedure possible (enucleation, partial nephrectomy). Asymptomatic angiomyolipomas warrant CT and/or ultrasound examination every 6 or 12 months depending on size.</dc:description>
