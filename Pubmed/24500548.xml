<dc:description xml:lang="en">Although pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists account for nearly half of those killed in traffic accidents in the world, little is known about the geographical distribution patterns of these vulnerable roadway users. Using spatial scan statistics techniques, the spatiotemporal variations in the mortality of motorcycle users in Argentina were analyzed for the period 2001-2010, as well as the spatial variations in mortality and motorcycle registration from 2007-2010. Two space-time clusters with a high risk of death for motorcycle riders were identified during the second half of the study period. Overall, there was a spatial relationship between motorcycle registrations and the mortality of the users of these vehicles in the northern-central region of Argentina. The results of this study indicate the need to reinforce primary prevention policies focused on motorcycle users in this region of the country, especially in areas with high population density.</dc:description>
