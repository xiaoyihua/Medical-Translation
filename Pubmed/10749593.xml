<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To confirm whether 1-week anti-Helicobacter therapy to achieve ulcer healing is sufficient and safe. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed patients with peptic ulcer who were infected with Helicobacter pylori and treated with 3 different 7-day regimens, according to predefined protocols in 3 different centers in the same geographical area (Aragón, Spain). Three combinations commonly described in the literature were used: a) omeprazole (40 mg/24 h), tetracycline hydrochloride (2 g/24 h), colloidal bismuth subcitrate (480 mg/24 h) and metronidazole (750 mg/24 h) (OBTM, n = 105); b) omeprazole (40 mg/24 h), clarithromycin (1.5 g/24 h) and amoxicillin (3 g/24 h) (O40C1.5A3, n = 13); and c) omeprazole (40 mg/24 h), clarithromycin (1 g/24 h) and amoxicillin (2 g/24 h) (O40C1A2, n = 4). In all patients the diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease was confirmed endoscopically, and H. pylori infection was verified with urease testing and histological analysis. After treatment ended, no other antacids were allowed until after endoscopic examination to check eradication and ulcer healing. RESULTS 122 patients were included (107 with duodenal ulcer, 12 with gastric ulcer and 3 with both). Compliance was good and side effects infrequent and mild. Eradication rates were 88.5% (93/105) in the OBTM group, 100% (13/13) with O40C1.5A3, and 75% (3/4) with O40C1A2. Healing was achieved in 98.16% (107/109) of the patients in whom the bacterial infection was eradicated, and in 23.07% (3/13) of those in whom it was not (p &lt; 0.0001). No patient had any complications during the period without treatment. CONCLUSIONS 1-week eradication therapy with previously described combinations commonly used in clinical practice achieves high ulcer healing rates with no complications in the period without antacid treatment. We consider that it is not necessary, at least in most patients, to prolong antacid therapy.</dc:description>
