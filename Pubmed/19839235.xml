<dc:description xml:lang="en">PermaFoam, the dressing under study, is characterized as a polyurethane foam having gradient pores which, besides all the aforementioned characteristics, makes it possible to: rapidly absorb large quantity of seepage or exudation, cell remains and viscous seepage thanks to a layer of large size pores that are in contact with the wound; distribute and retain seepage in an intermediate layer of this dressing which is composed of pores having a smaller diameter; and, through a final layer characterized by an even smaller pore which permits a high degree of semi-permeability and adaptability to the distinct locales where this dressing needs be applied. With the objective to evaluate the usefulness of this dressing under study for the cicatrization of wounds having diverse etiology this research project was carried out. Secondary objectives included: reducing the surface of a wound, respecting the perilesional skin, estimating the ease of handling and applying this dressing, and identifying the most outstanding qualities this dressing provides.</dc:description>
