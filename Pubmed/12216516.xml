<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify the etiologic agent responsible for a disease outbreak following an overflow of sewage water in Valle de Chalco, Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out. Rectal samples were collected from the population of Chalco valley, who suffered from diarrhea and vomiting during a natural disaster that took place on May 31, 2000. The Instituto de Diagnóstico y Referencia Epidemiológicos (Epidemic Reference and Diagnosis Institute, InDRE, Ministry of Health), received 1521 rectal swab samples from diarrhea cases, to test for E. coli strains. Statistical analysis was performed to find a difference of proportions between cases and non-cases (chi-squared test). ETEC, EIEC, EPEC and EHEC pathogenic E. coli groups were hybridized by colony blot. RESULTS Strains isolated were ETEC (62.2%), EIEC (0.84%), EPEC (0.84%), and EHEC non-O157:H7 (0.08%); there was no hybridization in 36.02% of E. coli strains. Other isolated microorganisms were Salmonella spp (0.45%) and Shigella spp (0.06%). CONCLUSIONS Enterotoxigenic E. coli was the most likely etiologic agent. Sanitary control strategies should be targeted to preventing outbreaks caused by this pathogenic agent.
