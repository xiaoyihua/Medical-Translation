<dc:description xml:lang="en">The association between cancer and hypercoagulability states is well known. It usually presents as a complication of gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas. We present the case of patient diagnosed of prostatic adenocarcinoma who was admitted because of pain and inflammation in the left side of the neck. The ultrasound study showed a jugular vein thrombosis. In the bibliographic review (MEDLINE 1990-1995), we have not found any similar reports Jugular vein thrombosis is a rare complication and usually is secondary to central vein catheter insertion, although it has been also described with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, infections, head and neck tumors and rarely in other neoplastic diseases. The physiopathologic process is not well known, although it is known that neoplastic cells interact with the thrombin and plasmin generating systems and that there is also a decrease in coagulation inhibitors, all of which leads to prothrombin activation in the absence of the corresponding increases in thrombin inhibitor complexes.</dc:description>
