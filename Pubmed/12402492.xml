<dc:description xml:lang="en">From 1990 to september 2001, we have performed surgery in 22 patients diagnosed as Secondary hyperparathyroidism and three patients diagnosed as Tertiary, that were sent to our clinic from the Nephrology Department. These pathologies are rare in clinical practice but they mean a lot for the patient and his family. In 17 cases we performed a subtotal parathyroidectomy, in 2 cases a total parathyroidectomy and in another 2 an adenoma was found and excised. In one of these 22 cases and following a careful exam we did not final pathological parathynoids. We present and analysed here our results with an obvious improvement in all patients but one. Finally we carry out a revision of the literature comparing our results to other similar published series.</dc:description>
