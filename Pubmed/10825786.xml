<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS The immediate hypersensibility immediate mediated by IgE represents the damage mechanism type 1 according to the original classification of Gell &amp; Coombs. MATERIAL AND METHOD Observational study, descriptive, transverse in the one which were checked the files of 1250 patient of the Allergy Service of the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez with diagnostic of rhinitis allergic; asthma; asthma and rhinitis allergic.

With respect to result of cutaneous test 154 (12.32%) were negative and 1096 (87.68%) were positive to one or more antigens. CONCLUSIONS The obtained results indicate the importance of accomplishing greater number of studies that relate not only the percentages of positive in the determination of immediate hypersensitive, but also to the frequency of pollens in the means to the one which is unfolded the patient, together with the stages of pollination throughout the Mexican Republic, in pediatric population as well as in adult, to effect cutaneous tests selects according to the zone and to stablish a specific treatment and adapted for each patient.</dc:description>
