<dc:description xml:lang="en">The European Cubicin Outcomes Registry and Experience (EUCORE) is an ongoing, retrospective, European, post-marketing, non-comparative database of daptomycin use in patients that have received at least one daptomycin dose. The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients treated with this drug. This article presents the analysis of patients included in Spanish institutions from January 2006 to March 2010. A total of 726 patients were included: 66% males, 48.6% aged more than 65 years old, and 70% with comorbidities. Daptomycin was administered in the outpatient setting in 20.3% of the patients. More than 50% of the patients received a dose of 6 mg/kg/day and in 80% daptomycin was administered as a rescue therapy. The median treatment duration was 14 days. The infections treated were bacteremia (32.51%), skin and soft tissue infections (31.4%), infectious endocarditis (14.33%), infections associated with prosthetic materials (10.9%), osteoarticular infections (6.1%), and others. Infections were caused by Staphylococcus aureus (40.5%; 14.4% methicilllin-resistant), coagulase-negative staphylococci (34.5%), enterococci (11.7%) and group viridans streptococci (2.9%). The overall rate of clinical success was 78.4% (81.5% when administered as first-line therapy and 77.6% when administered as rescue therapy). In patients with renal failure, the efficacy of daptomycin was lower. At the end of therapy, 8.7% of patients showed a decrease in creatinine clearance, and in 25 patients creatine kinase values were more than 10 times higher than normal values. Daptomycin is a safe and effective antimicrobial agent for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria.</dc:description>
