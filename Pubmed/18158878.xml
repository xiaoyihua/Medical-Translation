<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND We undertook this study to determine the effectiveness of triple treatment associated with Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota against Helicobacter pylori, in comparison with triple conventional treatment without Lactobacillus. METHODS We designed a clinical comparative randomized study that included patients of both sexes infected by Helicobacter pylori. Patients were studied with endoscopy, biopsy and serology. Control group received traditional triple treatment with clarithromycin, amoxicillin and omeprazole, and the active group received the same treatment plus Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota. With the breath test at 8 weeks we determined the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. RESULTS In the active group we included 31 patients. After treatment, in 29 persons (94%) it was possible to eradicate the Helicobacter pylori. On the other hand, the control group was comprised of 33 patients who received only the traditional triple treatment; eradication was achieved in 25 patients (76%). Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) were observed in favor of active group treatment. CONCLUSIONS Traditional triple treatment plus Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota is associated with a higher frequency of eradication of Helicobacter pylori than triple treatment alone.</dc:description>
