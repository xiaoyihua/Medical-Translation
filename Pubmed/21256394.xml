<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE to review our experience in renal retransplantations. MATERIALS AND METHODS we carried out a retrospective study on 71 patients with retransplantation performed between 1980 and 2005. We studied: the characteristics of the recipient and graft, surgery data, causes of loss of the graft, number of rejects and transplantectomies and, survival of the graft. RESULTS the most frequent cause of graft loss was chronic rejection. The causes of first graft loss were not associated with a greater loss of the second graft (p&gt;0.05). The percentage of anti-HLA antibodies increased in the second transplant in comparison to the first (17.23±27.91% vs. 1.21±7.43%) (p=0.001), however, it was not correlated with a significant increase in loss of the second graft (p=0.320). There were no significant differences between the complications of the first and second transplants (p&gt;0.05) and they were not associated with graft loss (p&gt;0.05). The patients with a transplantectomy in the first transplant presented a risk 8.5 times higher of undergoing a second one (p=0.0001; OR: 8.54; CI: 95% 0.941 - 77.501). The most frequent cause of transplantectomies in the second transplant was acute rejection. Acute rejection as a cause for transplantectomy in the first transplant proved to be an independent risk factor of transplantectomy of the second transplant (p=0.009). The mean survival of the second graft was 5.08±4.81 years, higher than the first transplant (p=0.133). The survival of the graft at 1.5 and 10 years was 83%, 75% and 52%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS the survival of the second transplant was not lower than the first, neither was there an increase in the number of complications.</dc:description>
