<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with primary angioplasty, the inability to achieve successful coronary reperfusion is associated with higher mortality. The objective of the study was to identify which characteristics may predict a lower angiographic success rate in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with coronary angioplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study population is constituted by the 790 patients with acute myocardial infarction that were treated with angioplasty within the 12 hours after the onset of symptoms from 1991 to 1999 at our institution. A successful angiographic result was considered in presence of a residual stenosis &lt; 50% and a TIMI flow 2 or 3 after the procedure. RESULTS A successful angiographic result and a final TIMI 3 flow were achieved in 736 (93.2%) and 652 (82.5%) patients, respectively. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with angiographic failure than in those with angiographic successful result (48 vs. 10%; p &lt; 0.01). Age under 65 (91 vs. 95%; p = 0.02), non smoking (90 vs. 96%; p &lt; 0,01), previous infarction (87 vs. 94%; p &lt; 0.01), angioplasty after failed thrombolysis (83 vs. 94%; p = 0. 02), cardiogenic shock (80 vs. 95%; p &lt; 0.01), undetermined location (67 vs. 93%; p &lt; 0.01), non-inferior location (92 vs. 96%; p = 0.04), left bundle branch block (64 vs. 94%; p &lt; 0.01), multivessel disease (91 vs. 95%; p = 0.02), left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 0.40 (89 vs. 97%; p &lt; 0.01), no utilization of coronary stenting (90 vs. 96%; p &lt; 0.01), and use of intraaortic balloon counterpulsation pump (82 vs. 95%; p &lt; 0.01) were associated with a lower angiographic success rate. In the multivariable analysis, the following were independent predictors for angiographic failure: left bundle branch block (odds ratio [OR], 12.95; CI 95%, 3.00-53.90), cardiogenic shock (OR, 4.20; CI 95%, 1.95-8.75), no utilization of coronary stent (OR, 3.44; CI 95%, 1.71-7.37), and previous infarction (OR, 2.82; CI 95%, 1.29-5.90). CONCLUSIONS Coronary angioplasty allows a successful coronary recanalization in most patients with acute myocardial infarction. Some basic characteristics, however, may identify some subsets in which a successful angiographic result may be more difficult to obtain.</dc:description>
