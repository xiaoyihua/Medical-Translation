<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate lipid profile in children with subclinical hypothyroidism. PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty-six children of both sexes aged between 2 and 9 years old, 17 with subclinical hypothyroidism (study group) and 23 healthy children (control group), were studied. Subclinical hypothyroidism was diagnosed when levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were greater than 4.65 .U/mL and those of free thyroxin (fT4) were normal. Children with subclinical hypothyroidism were observed for 4 months with no interventions and TSH and fT4 were again determined to confirm the diagnosis. A complete medical history was taken and a blood sample was extracted for lipid determinations including triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (ATGA) and antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies were also determined. RESULTS Of the 17 children who initially presented elevated serum TSH levels, seven (41.2 %) had normal levels at 4 months and were consequently excluded. No significant differences were found in age, weight, height or body mass index between the study and the control groups. No differences were found between the two groups in levels of anti-TPO antibodies and ATGA. The mean plasma HDL-C level was significantly lower in children with subclinical hypothyroidism than in controls (p &lt; 0.05) and a statistically significant association (p &lt; 0.013) was found between the presence of subclinical hypothyroidism and a greater frequency of low HDL-C levels. CONCLUSION Subclinical hypothyroidism may be transitory in a considerable percentage of children. Children with subclinical hypothyroidism had significantly lower HDL-C levels, suggesting an atherogenic lipid profile in this entity.</dc:description>
