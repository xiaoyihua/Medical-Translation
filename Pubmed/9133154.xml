<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTROD: Clinical samples gives a piece of information mediated by singular characteristics of the area (general practitioners, health services organization, needs of care feld by family or patient), but they are an important way in the study of psychosocial variables and their influence in pathways and morbidity of psychiatric disorders. MET: We obtained by SISMA survey (Information System for Mental Health in Andalucia) clinical and sociodemographic variables of a 2,016 Mental Health Center sample consulting during 40 months (attendance people = 90,368, rural area). We realized a descriptive and association study, with special attention to gender as modulating another factors related with health services use, diagnostic and clinical features. RES: ICD-10 Diagnostic groups of our sample was Affective disorders (F.3x) (36.5%, OR 1.99 for female), Neurotic disorders (F.4x) (29.75%, OR 2.01 for female) and Schizophrenia and related disorders (F.2x) (9.83%, OR 0.31 for female). The female-male ratio of our clinical sample was 1.70, incremented to 2.31 in geriatrics. Woman significantly consulted by themselves and men by their family. Married marital status was a help factor of psychopathology in women, as single status in men. Work activity and high or medium educative level was protective factors of psychopathology. CONCLUS: Clinical and sociodemographic variables we have seen, give us similar results to another spanish samples, too similar to actually accepted in Psychiatric Epidemiology. Female gender and class-linked vulnerability have an important influence as help-factors for specialized psychiatric treatment in our community.</dc:description>
