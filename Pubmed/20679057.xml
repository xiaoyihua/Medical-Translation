<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to provide data on canine fecal and helminthic contamination from parks and sidewalks in Buenos Aires City, collected by the Laboratory of General Parasitology, School of Sciences, University of Buenos Aires. A census of dog feces was performed in 1-11 parks per year between 1991 and 2006, a single day each year. In the period 2000-2006, the census included feces on sidewalks surrounding the park. Thirty fresh fecal samples were randomly collected from each park to determine the presence of helminth eggs and fixed with 5% formalin until diagnosis by the Willis' flotation method with a saturated solution of NaCl. The 51 censuses showed a median of 288 feces/park and 82% of the feces were collected from grass or bare-ground areas. Fecal contamination in parks was higher between 2000/06 than in the previous period (p &lt; 0.0000), and it increased with increasing human density on sidewalks surrounding the park (p =0.0076). The sidewalks showed a inverse pattern, with larger fecal contamination in the lesser densely populated areas (p =0.0000). All parks showed infected samples. The most frequent helminth genera were Ancylostoma (20.47%), Trichuris (2.59%) and Toxocara (1.70%). Our results indicated that an increase in dog number in addition to deficient public control policies accounted for the increase in dog fouling in public spaces of the city.</dc:description>
