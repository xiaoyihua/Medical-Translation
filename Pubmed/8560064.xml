<dc:description xml:lang="en">Our experience is based on laparoscopic hysterectomies performs from August 1992 to May 1994. The purpose of the initial surgical objective is described, as well as different variations of the technique. The procedure was systematized, the operating time was diminished to a considerable extent, thus avoiding intra-operatory complications. Pre-operatory diagnosis and histopathological findings were enumerated. Intra-operatory and post-operatory complications were evaluated. With an increasing development of the technique, a shorter operating time was made possible. The length of hospital stay and its quality were unrelated to the operation time. A quick recovery was reached as regards complete activity of the patients. Laparoscopic hysterectomy performed by an endoscopic-gynecologist surgeon represents an alternative and a new way of thinking.</dc:description>
