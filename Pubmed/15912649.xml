<dc:description xml:lang="en">All-trans retinoic acid (AR-t) is used for treating acute promyelocytic leukemia and renal cell carcinoma and it also has therapeutic value in several animal models of renal disease. Among its renal targets, mesangial cells have been widely studied: they have both retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR) and the cell growth is inhibited when human mesangial cells are incubated with 1-10 microM AR-t. Although his effect has been related with the antiproliferative action of AR-t, there are no studies on the involvement of apoptosis in AR-t induced cell growth when higher concentrations of retinoid are used. Our studies show that 25 microM AR-t triggers mesangial cell apoptosis assessed by light and fluorescence microscopy (Giemsa stain and acridine orange stain, respectively), DNA electrophoresis, flow cytometry (annexin-V) and immunocytochemistry (TUNEL). AR-t induced apoptosis was not inhibited by preincubation with the RXR pan-antagonist HX531 nor with the RAR pan-antagonist AGN 193109, this suggesting RAR and RXIR are not involved in AR-t induced cell death. Previous results of our group showed that ERK (extracellular regulated kinase) and INK (c-Jun kinase), two members of the MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase family, are involved in non apoptotic effects of AR-t on mesangial cells. Therefore we focussed on the stress activated p38 kinase, the third member of the MAPK family, to investigate its involvement in AR-t induced apoptosis. The results confirmed a role of p38 since: 1) preincubation with B5203589, a p38 inhibitor, inhibited ARA induced apoptosis; 2) incubation with AR-t induced p38 phosphorilation after few minutes and p38 remained phosphorilated for at least 8 hours and 3) AR-t induced p38 phosphorilation was inhibited by SB203589. These data suggest that AR-t might have toxic side effects on the kidney but also suggest that AR-t could be an useful inhibitor of pathological mesangial cell expansion.</dc:description>
