<dc:description xml:lang="en">The arteriovenous fistula can be a major and late complication of percutaneous renal biopsies of native kidneys. The incidence of arteriovenous fistulas appears to be low and has been infrequently mentioned in large series of biopsies although there are a number of individual reports. In most part of cases, no systemic effects of the arteriovenous fistulas were observed, so they close by themselves. Optimization of renal biopsy techniques aims not only at obtaining kidney tissue technically adequate for diagnosis, but at reducing biopsy-induced complications. When these complications are done, the new transvascular techniques can get the healing of fistula with the embolism by catheters. We describe the case of a 37-year-old woman who had chronic renal failure by a possible chronic glomerulonephritis. She developed deterioration of renal function after the percutaneous renal biopsy. An arteriovenous fistula of high flow was detected by Doppler ultrasound. Then, it was confirmed angiographically and closed by embolism's catheter without damage of renal tissue.</dc:description>
