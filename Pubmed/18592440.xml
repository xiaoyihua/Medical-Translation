<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To compare the optic nerve parameters measured by confocal scanning laser in normal, ocular hypertensive and glaucomatous eyes; and in groups of ocular hypertensive eyes, classification of these according to the optic nerve appearance and to short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) results. METHODS 101 eyes of 101 normal subjects, 247 eyes of 247 ocular hypertensive subjects and 102 eyes of 102 glaucomatous subjects were studied. Subjects were classified based on intraocular pressure and standard automated perimetry (AP) performance. Hypertensive subjects were classified into ocular hypertensive and preperimetric glaucoma, and into ocular hypertensive with normal SWAP and hypertensive with pathological SWAP findings. Every patient underwent evaluation of the optic nerve, AP, SWAP and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (HRT II), resulting in the acquisition of topographic parameters of the optic nerve, which were then compared between the different groups. RESULTS Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) were found between normal subjects and glaucomatous eyes in all optic nerve parameters except disc area (2.23/2.1), height variation contour (0.41/0.39) and average variability (0.05/0.04). Ocular hypertensive eyes showed an overlap when compared with normal and glaucoma groups. No differences were found between normal subjects and those with ocular hypertension in mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (0.24/0.24) or between those with ocular hypertension and glaucoma in mean cup depth (0.28/0.3). Nevertheless, when those with ocular hypertension were segregated based on clinical evaluation of optic nerve or SWAP performance, the ability to define the presence of structural glaucoma damage improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS HRT enables moderate discrimination between normal, ocular hypertensive and glaucoma subjects. The use of diagnostic tests to detect early glaucomatous damage (such as short-wavelength automated perimetry) in ocular hypertensive eyes improves the ability of HRT to discriminate glaucoma.</dc:description>
