<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Descent of the testes is essential for normal function, with cryptorchidism being associated with defective spermatogenesis. The postpubertal function of cryptorchid testicles seems to be related to the original location of the undescended testis and the age at the moment of treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pubertal development and gonadal function in postpubertal patients treated for cryptorchidism during childhood. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty postpubertal males with a mean age of 17.35 years (range: 15-21 years) and treated for cryptorchidism during childhood were evaluated for pubertal development and gonadal function. A hormonal study which included basal determinations of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testicular volume assessed by Prader's orchidometer and semen analysis was performed on each patient. RESULTS Complete virilization was observed in all patients. The start and development of puberty were normal in all cases (except one patient that started puberty at 10 years of age). Basal studies in all patients showed normal levels of LH and testosterone. FSH levels were increased in 3 patients and normal in the other 17 patients. Fourteen patients achieved normal spermatogenesis with more than 20 million spermatozoa/ml. In the other 7 patients (35%), 5 with unilateral cryptorchidism and 2 with bilateral cryptorchidism, the sperm count remained below 20 million with a range of 0.8 to 18.4 x 10(6) spermatozoa/ml. The three males with elevated levels of FSH also presented oligospermia. CONCLUSIONS The results obtained show that pubertal development is normal after cryptorchidism. Impaired spermatogenesis is a major factor in undescended testes. Basal SH levels can be useful in predicting germinal damage secondary to cryptorchidism.</dc:description>
