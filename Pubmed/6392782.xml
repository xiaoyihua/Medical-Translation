<dc:description xml:lang="en">For the first time a case of "onchocercosis " was found in Ecuador. The patient is a coloured person which was examined in the Dermatology Department of the "Luis Vernaza" Hospital. The diagnosis was established on the bases of a biopsy of a thoracic nodule. The principal lesions which were established are the following: intense and generalized pigmentation of violet tones; a very accentuated ictiosiform statey specially on the trunk; hardened accematous plaques in the fore-arms; eruptions on the buttocks nodules in the region of the iliac bone and zones of vitiligo on the anterior part of the legs; linfatic nodules were also observed. Elefantiasis of the penis and scrotum. With this case we have established an endemic focus of onchocercosis in Esmeraldas, Ecuador.</dc:description>
