<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Sense of orientation in hospitals can be tricky considering the large extension of buildings and the inadequate signage. AIM To report some of the findings of a larger research project on wayfinding and patient navigation in Chilean hospitals. MATERIAL AND METHODS Five hundred nine hospital users waiting for attention in three hospitals were contacted and asked to answer a survey that lasted 10 minutes, about wayfinding and sense of orientation within the hospital. RESULTS Users declared to have a good opinion of existing signage in the three hospitals analyzed as well as their architectural organization in terms of their capacity to orient people. However, the vast majority of users asked for directions to navigate within the hospital to staff and medical personnel. CONCLUSIONS Patient navigation problems are imposing a great "hidden" cost to hospitals management due to missed appointments.</dc:description>
