<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND There is a high prevalence of dyspepsia and obesity in Mexican population. A relationship between obesity and dyspeptic symptoms has been proposed. OBJECTIVE To determine prevalence of dyspeptic symptoms in patients with normal weight, overweight and obesity. METHODS Prospective study on consecutive patients who attend for medical assistance for any reason in a first level medical center. Weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) were measured. A validated questionnaire for dyspepsia was applied. RESULTS Three-hundred and twenty patients were included (61.6% women, n = 197). The mean patient age was 37 ± 14.4 years old. Mean BMI was 26.68 with 42.2% of patients (n = 135) overweight, 35.6% (n = 114) with normal weight and 22.2% (n = 71) were obese. Compared to patients with normal weight and overweight the obesity group showed a higher prevalence of gastritis symptoms, pain, stomachache, heartburn, a worst quality of life, and a higher frequency of medication intake. Patients with overweight presented a higher score in quality of life and treatment compared with normal weight patients. CONCLUSIONS Obese patients showed a higher prevalence of dyspeptic symptoms compared to normal weight and overweight patients.</dc:description>
