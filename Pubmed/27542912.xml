<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The clinical inertia in the screening and treatment of patients at high or very high cardiovascular risk leads to the failure to achieve LDLc targets in this population. The aim of the DIANA study was to determine the opinion of doctors about the screening for dyslipidaemia, the usual practice, and the differences between Primary Care physicians and other specialties. MATERIAL AND METHODS A questionnaire, using the modified Delphi method, included four blocks on dyslipidemic patients with impaired glucose metabolism. RESULTS Of the 497 participating experts, 58% were Primary Care physicians. There was agreement on the need for dyslipidemia screening in patients with diabetes, ischaemic heart disease or hypertension, although to a lesser extent among Primary Care physicians. Greater significant differences were found in situations such as pre-diabetes or family history of premature cardiovascular disease (86.2% and 88.6% in Primary Care physicians versus 96.1% and 97.6% in other specialties, respectively). There was no agreement on the need for screening in the presence of xanthomas, xanthelasmas or corneal arcus in people under the age of 45 years, with statistically significant differences in the latter. CONCLUSIONS Dyslipidaemia screening is mainly performed on patients with cardiovascular disease or any major cardiovascular risk factor, and cutaneous lesions of familial hypercholesterolaemia are underestimated. The need for accurate screening and treatment of dyslipidemia in subjects at high cardiovascular risk must be stressed.</dc:description>
