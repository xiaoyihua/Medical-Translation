<dc:description xml:lang="en">The clinical records of 13 school-age children and of 22 adolescents with chronic peptic ulcer were reviewed. There was a predominance of the male sex and duodenal localization showed greater frequency than the gastric. The duration of symptoms previous to the diagnosis was greater in adolescents and repeated X-ray studies were required in school-agers to confirm the presence of an ulcer niche. The common symptoms were abdominal pain and vomiting. However, in 43% of the patients, abdominal pain was not typical of ulcer; therefore, all school-age children and adolescents with recurrent abdominal pain should be submitted to careful investigation. Anxiety and depression were found in 92.3% of the cases. Special ulcer diets and antiacids were given to all patients, but 8 cases showed no improvement. Psychiatric treatment and administration of psychodrugs may be useful. Diazepam was given to 50% of the patients who recovered and to one who did not recover.</dc:description>
