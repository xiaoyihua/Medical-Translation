<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Cervical dystonia may also cause limitation in articulation mobility and alteration of the balance, both accompanied with pain. AIM. To evaluate if hydrotherapy produces decrease of pain, increase in mobility and balance in patients diagnosed with cervical dystonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS A pre-post treatment pilot study was carried out without group control, with a sample of 16 patients (13 female and 3 male) diagnosed with cervical dystonia. The patients received an hydrotherapy treatment consisted of three individual sessions and three grupal sessions of aquatic exercises. In the pre-treatment phase the disability, severity and pain were evaluated by means of the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS); the balance was evaluated by means of the Get up and Go and Tinetti tests. In addition, the range of active mobility of the neck was measured with tape. The test were measured pre and post-treatment. RESULTS The Student t showed a significant difference (p &lt; 0, 01) in all the values. The range of active mobility of the neck improved in all movements: flexion (1.3 ± 1.0 cm), right lateralization (3.4 ± 1.7 cm) and left (4.0 ± 3.0 cm) and right rotation (1.6 ± 2.5 cm) and left (2.2 ± 1.5 cm). At the same time, all test improved too: Tinetti (3.0 ± 2.2), Get up and Go (2.3 ± 1.6) and TWSTRS (8.4 ± 5.4). CONCLUSIONS The outcomes of this pilot study show that hydrotherapy can be related a positive influence in cervical dystonia, producing neck mobility and balance improvements and pain decrease. Future studies are necessary.</dc:description>
