<dc:description xml:lang="en">The results of a quality control of the assistance, given through a programme of pregnancy in 12 health centres in Area number 1 of Toledo are shown here. To do so, an auditory was performed at a public hospital level and in the participating health centres, unifying explicit and normative criteria, which were the base to check a sample of 484 clinic records. In the results found, the high percentage of observance of the criteria referring to the early captation and the puerperal visit (90.3% and 94.6% respectively) is outstanding and the adequate treatment of the ferropenic anemia is the most frequently unobserved criteria (53.3%). Correction measures are established and standards for the re-evaluation are fixed. We emphasize the need to involve the second assistance level as well as the respective Management in the performance of health programmes in its aims, assuming the improvement of results as a responsibility of all of them.</dc:description>
