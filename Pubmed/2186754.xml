<dc:description xml:lang="en">A study was conducted at the out-patient Pediatric Neurology clinic of the Trujillo Peru Regional Teaching Hospital on 127 children with epilepsy and who were seen for the first time at the clinic. After completing two years of continuous treatment and free of any convulsions, the patients were followed and later controlled for a minimum period of two to four years. The object of the study was to correlate the frequency of relapses and risk factors which may have influenced the convulsions. Remission was seen in 70.7% of the cases while the convulsions recurred in 29.3% of the patients. The convulsions recurred during the first 24 months after treatment was completed. Relapses of epilepsy in children are directly related to the start of the convulsions at and early age to the type and severity of the episode, to the added neurological abnormalities as well as persistent paroxysmal EEG abnormalities.</dc:description>
