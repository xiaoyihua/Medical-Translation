<dc:description xml:lang="en">Absolute and corrected by creatinine excretion urinary Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) values were determined in 23 duodenal ulcer patients and compared to a control group. Basal serum pepsinogen I levels were measured in the patient group. Absolute urinary EGF values in patients were lower than in control group, such difference however, as such of EGF corrected by urinary creatinine excretion were not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). Absolute urinary EGF excretion in male patients was higher than in female patients (p &lt; 0.05), but after establishing the ratio EGF/Creatinine, the difference disappeared. There was no correlation between EGF and Pepsinogen I, it was inverse with age and positive with creatinine excretion. Some mechanisms are considered to explain the urinary EGF normality in these patients. The increasing importance given to EGF in ulcerous diseases and further trends in research are analyzed.</dc:description>
