<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ten children with isolated growth hormone deficiency were treated for 1 year with 0.5 UI/kg week with Somatrem (recombinant human growth hormone), given as intramuscular injections three times weekly. Before treatment the children had a chronological age of 7-12.4 years (mean 10.4 years), with a bone age at least 25% below the chronological age. There was no radiological evidence of an intra or suprasellar mass in any child, and no response to provocative growth hormone tests (with exercise or arginine-insulin injection). Informed written consent for treatment was obtained from the parents of each child. Clinical signs were registered every month; triiodothyronine, thyroxine, thyrotropine, glucose, urea, creatinine, blood cells count, and hemoglobine, glycosylated hemoglobine, glutamic-piruvic and glutamic-oxalacetic transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, anti-human growth hormone and, E. coli antibodies, insulin like growth factor 1, and bone age were assessed every 3 months. The mean height velocity was 0.27 +/- 0.1 cm/month before treatment, and increased throughout treatment to a value of 0.62 +/- 0.16 cm/month after 12 months. Within the first year eight of the 10 children had a height increase of 8.4 +/- 0.98 cm. The other two children showed no significant difference; one of them with a very low socioeconomic status, and the other developed typhoid fever. All of the children showed an advance in bone age, but none reached a bone age appropriate for their chronological age; without modifications in the laboratory parameters. Insulin like growth factor 1 increased in 9 children. Pain at the injection site was the only side effect reported.</dc:description>
