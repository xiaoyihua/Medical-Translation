<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To find out the influence that going to University has on changing smoking and alcohol habits, and on physical exercise in students in the EU. DESIGN Cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING University of Murcia. PARTICIPANTS A sample of 1179 students was selected. INTERVENTIONS A self-filled and anonymous questionnaire was used. It consisted of 36 questions using 4 measurement scales: level of health information on cardiovascular risks (CVR), smoking, alcohol consumption and doing physical exercise. RESULTS A total of 39.2% of university students in their last academic year said they were smokers, compared to 36.4% in the first year (NS). A total of 81.6% of first year students had consumed alcohol at weekends, compared to 81.1% of those in their last year (NS). In the overall assessment of alcohol consumption, 13% "stopped drinking or drank less: and 10% "drank more", although the majority (55%), did not change their drinking habits. As regards physical exercise, the number of students who did more physical exercise was 21.2% in the first academic year, compared to 20% of students in their last year (NS). CONCLUSIONS Going to University does not seem to exercise a positive influence on the habits and lifestyles of young people. Measures should be taken to encourage healthy lifestyles in Universities.</dc:description>
