<dc:description xml:lang="en">The immunohistochemical expression of CA19-9, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was studied in 103 tissue samples of gallbladder cancer and 25 samples of non tumoral gallbladder lesions. CA19-9 and EMA were positive in over 90% of cancers and non tumoral lesions. Dupan-2 expression was observed in 100% of non tumoral lesions and 78% of cancers. CEA expression was observed in 12% of non tumoral lesions and 89% of cancers. The magnitude of immunohistochemical staining was moderate or intense for all antibodies, except Dupan-2. No differences were observed in the location of positive staining in superficial or deep parts of the tumor. In these lesions the positive staining was cytoplasmatic with a granular and irregular pattern; on the contrary, in the non tumoral lesions, staining was seen in the apical parts of the cell. Calculated sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for CEA was 89%, 88% and 96% respectively. If future studies disclose a good correlation between serological and immunohistochemical detection of this antigen, its determination would be potentially useful in clinical grounds.</dc:description>
