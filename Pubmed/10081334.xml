<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the patterns of persistent symptomatology in workers industrially exposed to organophosphate pesticides. MATERIAL AND METHODS An observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study was performed. A questionnaire was applied to managers of a factory and to 89 workers, whose erythrocytic cholinesterase level was measured with the Magnotti and Lovibond method. Information is described through rates, central tendency measures and dispersion. Differences between groups were evaluated with the chi 2 test and the odds ratio was calculated. RESULTS Persistent symptomatology was found in 6.3 per 10 workers. 50% had six or more symptoms. No significant differences were found as to the risk of suffering from persistent symptomatology with respect to age, length of service or position at work. However, the highest proportion of symptoms was found in workers of 31 to 40 years of age, with 6 to 13 years of service, from the maintenance area, working as general operators or supervisors. Among the 13 workers with previous intoxication, the prevalence of persistent symptomatology was 6.9 against 6.1 in workers who had not been intoxicated before. The risk of acute poisoning in workers with more than 14 years of service was 4 times greater than in workers with less than 14 years of service (p &lt; 0.005). Average level of blood cholinesterase was normal (4.4 u/ml). CONCLUSIONS Results show a relationship between exposure to organophosphate pesticides and presence of persistent symptoms. It is necessary to study the prevalence of this symptomatology in exposed and non-exposed populations.</dc:description>
