<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The main goal of this study is to assess PGE-1 use by measuring and stratifying its effectiveness according to patient condition, using clinical parameters. Standard therapy consists of intravenous infusion for 21 days. MATERIAL AND METHODS A revision of 30 medical records was carried out on 28 men and 2 women with a mean age of 69.71 -- SD 14.84 -- years who had been treated with PGE1. Twenty-six patients had a diagnosis of chronic arterial ischemia (6 Grade I-II, 20 Grade III-IV), and 4 of diabetic gangrene. The following clinical parameters were measured both before and after therapy -- pain, distal perfusion, and necrotic lesions according to TASC (Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus). RESULTS Before treatment onset, 30 patients had pain and decreased distal perfusion, and 20 patients had necrotic lesions. Six patients discontinued therapy because of lesion worsening. After 21 days of treatment 18 patients continued to have pain and decreased distal perfusion, and 16 still had necrotic lesions. Stratifying results by diagnosis, those 6 patients diagnosed with grade I-II chronic arterial ischemia experienced improvement in the three clinical parameters being considered -- absence of pain and improved distal perfusion and necrotic lesions. CONCLUSIONS PGE1 is a beneficial medication, and optimal results are obtained when it is used in early peripheral vascular disease.</dc:description>
