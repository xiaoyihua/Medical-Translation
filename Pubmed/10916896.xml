<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To find and compare the social and demographic features and health status of two different ethnic and cultural groups, gypsies and payos (non-gypsies). DESIGN Observational, descriptive, crossover study. SETTING Primary care. PARTICIPANTS The 121 gypsy patients &gt; 14 registered at the centre and 121 controls who were matched for age. INTERVENTIONS Social and demographic variables, risk factors, chronic illnesses and involvement in preventive and health promotion programmes were gathered. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS On the basis of a questionnaire that was filled out with data from the primary care health histories, we saw that there were significant differences in educational background, jobs and work situation (p &lt; 0.0005). Among the gypsies there were more alcohol consumers, intravenous drug users and patients at social-health risk. Hb, Hc and HIV affected gypsies significantly more (the two groups were included in preventive programmes and activities). Mean age of death among gypsies was early (40.6 years vs. 73). Paradoxically, gypsies used private medicine more. CONCLUSIONS There were significant social-health differences between the two groups studied. The gypsies on our health centre lists need greater care from the primary care team, so that they can achieve better health status.</dc:description>
