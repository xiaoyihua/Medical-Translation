<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Genomic imprinting is the epigenetic change that occurred differentially in the specific genes in spermatozoa and oocyte according to their paternal or maternal origin, thus allowing a monoallelic expression. This review is a critical analysis of the published information relating to the role of the male imprinting on the successful reproduction. METHODS We performed a literature search on some of the components that regulate the male genomic imprinting and the possible role on reproductive events such as spermatogenesis, and placental and embryo development. RESULTS The literature analysis allowed us to appreciate structural, genetic and epigenetic changes occurring during the formation of the male gamete that could have an impact on embryo development, mainly in the formation of extraembryonic tissues as the placenta. CONCLUSION Alterations in the molecular mechanisms involved in the sperm DNA methylation during the spermatogenesis, could induce alterations in the normal pattern of expression required in the fetal-placental components development.</dc:description>
