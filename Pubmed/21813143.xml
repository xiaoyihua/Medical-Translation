<dc:description xml:lang="en">Teleradiology is an established fact in developed countries. It has been the subject of intense professional and even legal debate in recent years because the quality of care and the role of the radiologist as a medical specialist are at stake. The opportunities and the dangers involved in teleradiology are discussed in this article. The use of teleradiology in certain circumstances in the emergency department can result in significant benefits when done right; however, it is evident that poorly implemented teleradiology services can lead to significant decreases in the quality of care (for example when the aim is to provide a low cost reporting service through outsourcing). Radiologists must use their knowledge and collaboration to ensure that they have the main role in the design, management, and performance of teleradiology services. The stance of our scientific societies together with the legal and regulatory frameworks must be the pillars that support teleradiology as a medical act.</dc:description>
