<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The airport of Bogotá lies within the city and its expansion could produce an increase in adverse effects on the health of the inhabitants of Fontibón and Engativá districts due to the noise it generates. OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of sleep disturbances and associated factors among residents of Fontibón exposed to this noise. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study design was used, involving a sample of 205 people aged 18 to 65, selected by means of stratified random sampling. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Descriptive statistics were carried out, as well as correlation tests between the different scales. RESULTS A total of 60% of the residents reported poor quality sleep (PSQI&gt;5), with a mean PSQI of 7.19 (SD=3.931), and the following pathological interruptions were found: subjective sleep quality, 27%; sleep latency, 39%; sleep duration, 33%; habitual sleep efficiency, 37%; sleep alterations, 30%; diurnal dysfunction, 40%, and use of sleeping medication, 5%. According to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS&gt;10), 28% of residents reported daytime somnolence. Regarding the prevalence of poor quality sleep according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 17% of those who reported not being able to sleep because of noise associated this with air traffic. A correlation was observed between the index and the scale ( r =0.329, CI 95%: 0.20-0.44). CONCLUSIONS Inhabitants of the district reported poor sleep quality due to exposure to noise, airport operations being one of the main generating sources. Noise mitigation strategies in the district need to be reviewed and the public health implications of the El Dorado Airport expansion should be considered.</dc:description>
