<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of medical advice and cognitive-behavioral group therapy in the treatment of primary obesity in children and adolescents 7 to 15 years old. PATIENTS AND METHODS From five primary care centers 353 subjects (176 boys and 177 girls) were recruited and assigned to three groups. These groups were: medical advice (Group 1), cognitive-behavioral group therapy (Group 2) and those that rejected all treatments (Group 3). Forty variables were controlled and studied for association with prognosis. RESULTS A significant, but modest decrease in relative body mass index was noted in groups 1 and 2 in the first 6 months, but at two years no differences between the three groups were detected. CONCLUSIONS It is concluded that cognitive-behavioral group therapy is not more effective than medical advice in our population and neither had a significant effect at two years when compared to no treatment.</dc:description>
