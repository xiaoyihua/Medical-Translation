<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Rhinosinusitis is an inflammatory response affecting mucosa membrane of nasal cavity of one or more paranasal sinus. Its prevalence is of 14 and 5-13% in adults and children, respectively. Rhinosinusitis causes high rate of scholar and labor absenteeism. OBJECTIVE To know diagnostic and treatment criteria of rhinosinusitis in units of familial medicine, otolaryngology and allergy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A series of 25 patients randomly obtained from familial medicine units 21 and 28 of the IMSS, was studied. Diagnosis was assessed according to 1998 Consensus and computed tomography was considered the gold standard. It was performed to all patients and evaluated by a study-blind radiologist. RESULTS Diagnosis of rhinosinusitis was done by familial medicine unit in 68%, otolaryngology service in 40% and allergy service in 64%. Clinical criteria most used were nasal congestion and anterior and posterior nasal discharge. The more requested examination was computed tomography (38.7%) and in 30% of cases, medical treatment was not prescribed. CONCLUSIONS Familial physicians, otolaryngologists and allergists use, with low frequency, international criteria for diagnosis and treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. Otolaryngologists perform other differential diagnosis.</dc:description>
