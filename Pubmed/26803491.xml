<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the prognostic value of the therapeutic response by (11)C-choline PET/CT in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence in which (11)C-choline PET/CT indicated radio-guided radiotherapy. METHODS The study included 37 patients initially treated with prostatectomy, who were treated due to biochemical recurrence. (11)C-choline PE/CT detected infra-diaphragmatic lymph-node involvement. All were selected for intensity modulated radiation therapy, escalating the dose according to the PET findings. One year after treatment patients underwent PSA and (11)C-choline PET/CT categorizing response (complete/partial/progression). Clinical/biochemical/image monitoring was performed until appearance of second relapse or 36 months in disease-free patients. RESULTS (11)C-choline PET/CT could detect lymph nodes in all 37 patients. They were 18 (48.6%) of more than a centimetre in size and 19 (51.3%) with no pathological CT morphology: 9 (24.3%) with positive lymph nodes of around one centimetre and 10 (27.0%) only less than a centimetre in size. The response by (11)C-choline PET/CT was categorised one year after radiotherapy: 16 patients (43.2%) complete response; 15 (40.5%) partial response, and 6 (16.2%) progression. The response was concordant between the PSA result and (11)C-choline PET/CT in 32 patients (86.5%), and discordant in five (13.5%). New recurrence was detected in 12 patients (80%) with partial response, and 5 (31.2%) with complete response. The mean time to recurrence was 9 months after partial response, and 18 months after complete response (significant difference, p&lt;.0001). CONCLUSION (11)C-choline PET/CT allows the selection of patients with recurrent prostate cancer candidates for radiotherapy and to plan the technique. The evaluation of therapeutic response by (11)C-choline PET/CT has prognostic significance.</dc:description>
