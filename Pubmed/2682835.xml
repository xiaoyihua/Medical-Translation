<dc:description xml:lang="en">The topic of esophagitis due to Candida (ED), the most frequent infection of the esophagus, is reviewed. In recent years we have seen increased interest in candida esophagitis, fundamentally due to its relation with AIDS, for which it constitutes a diagnostic criteria. Candida esophagitis, although it can appear in apparently healthy subjects, is usually associated with processes that impair the immune system, as well as with local lesions of the esophagus. The typical clinical presentation is as odynophagia, dysphagia and/or retrosternal pain, although asymptomatic forms are frequent, and its association with oropharyngeal candidiasis is variable. Oral endoscopy is the diagnostic technique of choice, since it permits samples to be taken for histologic and cytologic study and cultures; cytology is the most sensitive and specific technique. The differential diagnosis should be made fundamentally with other infectious esophagitis pictures, particularly herpes, and with reflux esophagitis. Treatment is based on antifungal drugs, most frequently nystatin, amphotericin B and ketoconazole.</dc:description>
