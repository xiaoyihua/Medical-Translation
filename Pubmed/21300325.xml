<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Skin diseases account for a large number of consultations in primary care. The objective of this study was to determine the characteristics and cost of referrals from primary care to a dermatology clinic. MATERIAL AND METHODS Descriptive cross-sectional study of referrals from a primary care health center to a dermatology clinic. The dermatology clinic was situated in the same health center and was attended by a dermatologist from Complejo Hospitalario Universitario in Albacete, Spain. The study was performed on 10 days selected at random between April 21, 2009, and June 26, 2009. The data gathered included age, sex, use of cryotherapy, and diagnostic group. Patients were divided into 4 diagnostic groups: A) benign degenerative disease or trivial disorders whose treatment may not merit involvement of the national health service, B) diseases resolved with a single dermatology consultation at the health center, C) diseases requiring evaluation in hospital-based dermatology outpatients, and D) diseases referred for surgical treatment. RESULTS Data were gathered on 257 patients with a mean age was 41.18 years and there was a slight female predominance. The majority of patients were in diagnostic group B (53.7%), followed by groups A (19.1%), C (19.1%), and D (8.2%). The total estimated cost of these 257 visits was €29 750.32, of which €5672.24 was for trivial disorders. CONCLUSIONS The current high prevalence of trivial disorders in the caseload of dermatology clinics by trivial disorders makes it necessary to control referrals from primary care more strictly.</dc:description>
