<dc:title xml:lang="en">Primary cancellous bone formation around micro-chambered beads</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objectives: The question has been raised whether benign bone defects in patients can be treated with bone forming osteoconductive ceramics achieving primarily a cancellous bone scaffold, which is under load from the beginning Material and methods: Ten reconstructions were performed in 9 patients (6 women and 3 male), with a mean age of 49 (25-65) years, suffering a high variety of epi- and metaphyseal defects, four tibial fractures, two calcaneal fractures, one pathological phalangeal fracture, one chondroma of the distal femur and two open-wedge osteotomies were filled with micro-chambered ceramic beads of 4 and 6 mm in diameter. The mean follow up was 22 (7- 8) months. X-rays and CT-scans formed the basis for the evaluation of the reconstruction of the cancellous bone scaffolds. Results: All cancellous structures were rebuilt, if completely filled with bone-forming elements. If the filling was incomplete, no physiological cancellous bone scaffold resulted. The _-TCP micro-chambered beads were completely reabsorbed or sandwich-like incorporated at the time of evaluation. The HA micro-chambered beads revealed a contrast enhancement and were integrated in the osseous construction of the bone scaffold. Conclusion: Primary cancellous bone formation can be achieved with osteoconductive ceramic micro-chambered beads and can be combined with any osteosynthesis for stable fixation (AU)</dc:description>
