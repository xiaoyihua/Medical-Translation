<dc:description xml:lang="en">The classical definition of self-medication is "the taking of drugs, herbs or home remedies on one's own initiative, or on the advice of another person, without consulting a doctor". Used as a solution to the wide range of complaints and minor health problems which may appear over a lifetime, it can be the result of an individual choice or by the influence of a family who is well informed about which techniques and drugs are safe and useful. This paper reviews the concept of self-medication, placing particular emphasis on the common self-medication errors within dentistry and their negative consequences in terms of systemic disease. Used in a responsible way self-medication is desirable because, as an independent search for a drug treatment, it can complement the work of health professionals. Furthermore, it represents a self affirming, independent attitude on the part of patients. Information, therapeutic advice and education are argued to be the basic elements underlying responsible self-medication.</dc:description>
