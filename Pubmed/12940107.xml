<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Epidemiologically there is an association between allergic rhinitis and asthma due to a common inflammatory process. Asthma can affect 40% of the patients with rhinitis and 80% of asthmatics present rhinitis. The relationship between the two diseases is explained by the term of "a united airway". Some patients with allergic rhinitis have nonspecific bronchial hyper-responsiveness, specially during the exacerbation stage. These patients have a unique physiologic characteristic that differs from the asthmatic and healthy subjects developing bronchoconstriction not related to clinical bronchospasm, therefore, allergic rhinitis is considered a risk factor for the asthma development. OBJECTIVE To determine if there is bronchial hyper-responsiveness in patients with allergic and not allergic rhinitis, by correlating with the eosinophilia in nasal mucosa. MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied a total of 32 patients with an age range from 18 to 38 years, of both sexes (11 men and 17 women) of the Hospital Regional Lic. Adolfo Lopez Mateos, ISSSTE. They were submitted to clinical history, laboratory studies (blood count cell, serum IgE levels, eosinophils of nasal mucosa), roentgenograms (paranasal sinus and esophagus-gastroduodenal series) and allergy skin tests with 32 allergens. It was taken biopsy of nasal mucosa for the search of eosinophils and it was carried out bronchial challenge with distilled water. Twenty-eight patients concluded the study, they were divided in two groups: a group of 15 patients with diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and another group of 13 patients with diagnosis of non allergic rhinitis. RESULTS Fifty-six spirometry studies were performed and only 4 patients (26.6%) with diagnosis of allergic rhinitis presented fall of the FEV1 in the bronchial challenge in comparison with the group of non allergic rhinitis in which there were no changes in the FEV1 later to the bronchial challenge. This difference was statistically significant (-4.3 and 0.15, respectively with a p &lt; 0.0370, CI 95%). Moreover, only in the group of allergic rhinitis eosinophils were found in the biopsy of nasal mucosa (93.3%). CONCLUSIONS Nonspecific bronchial hyper-responsiveness is present in patients with allergic rhinitis. The presence of nasal eosinophils is a persistent inflammation parameter suggesting the allergic origin in these patients.</dc:description>
