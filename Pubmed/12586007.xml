<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the results of endoscopic dilatation in caustic esophageal strictures and to analyze the factors associated with a favorable response. PATIENTS AND METHOD We performed a retrospective study of 33 patients who underwent dilatation with Savary bougie between 1989 and 2001. Response to initial dilatation and outcome during follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS The mean age was 50 years (8-83) and 58% were women. Intake was accidental in 29 (88%). In all patients, the caustic substance ingested was alkali. Dilatation was started in the acute phase in 12 patients (36%) and 13 presented inflammatory phenomena adjacent to the stenosis. During initial dilatation, 2 1.6 sessions (2-18) were performed and a favorable response was obtained in 18 patients (54%). At the end of follow-up, 68% of the patients presented satisfactory health status. The comparative study revealed that statistically significant variables for a favorable response to treatment were: accidental alkali intake, instauration of treatment in the chronic phase, absence of inflammatory phenomena, and a small number of initial dilatation sessions. CONCLUSIONS In our series, more than half the patients with esophageal stenosis due to intake of corrosive alkalis showed a favorable initial response. In these patients with acute-phase stenosis who required a greater number of initial dilatation sessions, endoscopic therapy was less effective.</dc:description>
