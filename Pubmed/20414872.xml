<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Diagnosing a stroke can sometimes be difficult. There are a number of mimic conditions that can lead to false diagnoses. AIM To examine false diagnoses of acute stroke. PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed the medical histories with diagnoses of acute stroke -i.e. ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA)- for a three-month period. Alternative diagnoses were established in doubtful stroke cases (without meeting the World Health Organisation stroke criteria). RESULTS Altogether there were 358 patients: 110 TIA, 191 ischaemics and 57 haemorrhagics. In all, 65 false diagnoses were selected, which represented 18.2% of the total number (41.8% of the cases of TIA) and 31.8% of the strokes admitted in the emergency department. The subtypes of false diagnoses were: 46 TIA (70.8%), 18 ischaemics (27.7%) and one haemorrhagic (1.5%). The alternative diagnoses were the following: syncope/pre-syncope in 10.8% of cases (n = 7); confusional syndrome/disorientation in 21.5% (n = 14); lowered level of consciousness in 27.7% (n = 18); generalised weakness in 6.2% (n = 4); dizziness/vertigo in 3.1% (n = 2); isolated dysarthria in 10.8% (n = 7); epileptic seizure in 6.2% (n = 4); and others in 13.8% (n = 9). A total of 71.7% could be attributed to systemic causes. The mean age was 79 years and 64.6% were females (n = 42). Computerised tomography of the head was performed in 70.8% of the cases (n = 46). A neurologist assessed 7.7% of them (n = 5). The destination on being discharged was: primary care (53.3%), visit to neurology department (31.7%), visit internal medicine department (6.7%), hospitalisation in neurology department (1.7%), hospitalisation in other specialties (1.7%), transfer (1.7%) and death (3.3%). CONCLUSIONS False diagnoses of cerebrovascular diseases are common. In emergency departments almost half of the diagnoses of TIA may be wrong. Most false diagnoses refer to TIA (70%) and occur in elderly patients, can be attributed to systemic causes, have not been assessed by a neurologist and are referred to primary care. Hospital stroke registries that include emergency patients may be overestimated, especially in the number of cases of TIA.</dc:description>
