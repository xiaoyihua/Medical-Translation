<dc:description xml:lang="en">The present study was undertaken in 223 male patients who had consulted for erectile dysfunction. Patient failure to obtain spontaneous erection on waking was a prerequisite for inclusion in the study. The mean patient age was 50.82 years. The penile brachial pressure index (PBI) was determined by Doppler stethoscopy in all patients; 194 patients had a mean PBI of 0.79%. We evaluated 197 patients for the following arterial risk factors: smoking habit, hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The results showed 148 were smokers; of these, 40 (28.6%) had no other arterial risk factor. Ninety-five had hyperlipidemia; of these, 19 (20%) had no other arterial risk factor. Hypertension was the only arterial risk factor in 8 (10%) of 73 hypertensives. Diabetes was the only arterial risk factor in 2 (6.4%) of the 31 with this condition. The mean age of patients with no arterial risk factors was 42.64 years. The number of risk factors increased with mean patient age. Three or more risk factors were observed in the patient group with a mean age of 57 years. The PBI dropped as the number of arterial risk factors rose. Patients with no arterial risk factors had a PBI of 0.83 whereas patients with three or more arterial risk factors had a PBI of 0.75. No statistical significance was observed when the arterial risk factors were combined.</dc:description>
