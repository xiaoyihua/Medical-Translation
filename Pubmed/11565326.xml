<dc:description xml:lang="en">The present review is focused on chronic RV pressure overload or Cor Pulmonale as it may occur in the setting of two distinct disorders: those associated with abnormal pulmonary gas exchange (hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia) where chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause, and those associated with pulmonary vascular obstruction where primary pulmonary hypertension (PDDH) is the representative example. The clinical curse, prognostic, implications, and therapeutic strategies differ considerably in these two clinical entities. Right ventricular failure (RVF) may adversely influence the natural history and prognosis of patients with diverse cardiopulmonary disorders. It has been long established that right ventricular (RV) ischemia, RV overload, and RV pressure overload, alone or in combination, are the main factors involved in the pathogenesis of RVF. From the pathophysiologic point of view, RVF of COPD is more a congestive type of failure, in which activation of renin-angiotensin system is involved. In PPH, a low cardiac output state is predominant and the precise mechanism of RVF remains unknown. Current evidence in favor of the pathogenetic role of ischemia, adrenergic overdrive, and genetic determination are all reviewed during the course.</dc:description>
