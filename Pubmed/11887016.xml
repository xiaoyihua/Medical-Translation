<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES This work shows the results of a study of the proliferation of bone tissue in the mouth. DESIGN OF THE STUDY It was carried out on a sample of 530 persons who were natives of Central American countries, 179 males and 154 females, evaluating the rate of appearance of these formations depending on age, sex, racial group, and their location within the jaw. RESULTS It was observed that 38% of the total sample showed hard tissue proliferation in the mouth. Of these cases, 158 (80%) were located in the superior maxilla and 48 (20%) of the cases in the jaw. Of which, 52 were men (25%) and 154 women (75%). This proliferation has greater incidence in the black race, in university students and liberal professions. The most frequent are torus palatinus and bilateral torus mandibularis. CONCLUSIONS The Central American population shows a high incidence of hard tissue proliferations in the mouth; a radiological study is sufficient for their detection.</dc:description>
