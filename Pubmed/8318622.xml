<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the level of health of individuals living in 1987 in Sector 7 of the Autonomous Community of Madrid (ACM). DESIGN Crossover analysis of the mortality among residents of Sector 7 of the ACM in 1987. SETTING The Madrid districts, Centro, Chamberí and Latina, which compose Sector 7 of the ACM. POPULATION UNDER STUDY: The 5,460 deaths of Sector 7 residents registered in 1987. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The mortality rates (both overall and broken down according to C.I.E. 9th causes), the mortality rates of those under 70 and the rates of years of life potentially lost were standardised by the direct method. The following results were obtained: 1. The mortality rates standardised according to age in the Centro district (7.82 per thousand) were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than those of the other Sector 7 districts (Chamberí and Latina were both at 6.25 per thousand) and of the ACM as a whole (6.63 per thousand). 2. The mortality rates, standardised by age for the population under 70 in the Centro district, were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than those of the other Sector 7 districts (Chamberí, 3.1 per thousand and Latina, 2.63 per thousand) and of the ACM as a whole (2.88 per thousand). CONCLUSIONS Analysing mortality by Health Area reveals differences in communities' health levels. These findings will assist more rational planning of the distribution of resources.</dc:description>
