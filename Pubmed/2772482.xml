<dc:description xml:lang="en">It has been reported that rapeseed in hens has been able to induce liver reticulum lysis and in rats it was possible to prevent the development of liver cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4). The objective of these experiments is 1st. to confirm by a more extensive study the prevention of cirrhosis; 2nd. to determine the ratio of rapeseed necessary to inhibit the development of cirrhosis and 3rd. to learn if the active part can be found in the whole seed, in the oil or in the meal. Wistar white male rats were used, to which CCl 4 was administered to induce liver cirrhosis and simultaneously rapeseed was administered mixed in the food at different concentrations, rapeseed oil and meal were also administered. The results of this study confirmed, first that rapeseed was able to prevent the cirrhosis development, second that this prevention can be obtained at 10% concentration, but not less, and third that rapeseed oil affords only partial protection and the meal affords none.</dc:description>
