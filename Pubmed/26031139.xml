<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Forestier syndrome, also known as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, is a disease of unknown etiology, characterized by an increase in the bone mass in different parts of the body, which results in chronic cervical and back pain. METHODS We report the case of a male 40-year-old patient with a diagnosis of Forestier syndrome in 2006 based on imaging studies. The clinical picture began with lumbar pain of progressive intensity irradiating to the right pelvic limb and associated with morning spine stiffness. Lumbar spine surgery was performed in June 2005 (laminotomy and L4-L5 diskectomy, interbody spaces filled with bone, and a dynamic interspinous spacer in L4-L5), but there was little postoperative improvement. We instituted antiinflammatory medical treatment as described in the literature and the patient did fine. DISCUSSION This condition is reported as an infrequent entity leading to physicians not considering it within their initial differential diagnoses. It presents with dysphagia as the main symptom, together with neck or lumbar pain due to ligament hypertrophy and ossification, and increased bone mass leading to the formation of bone bridges. Lumbar or cervical pain is a frequent cause for visiting the neurosurgeon. CONCLUSIONS The purpose of this paper is to present an unusual case of lumbar pain, which increases the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease, and may contribute to avoid unnecessary surgery. This was complemented with literature review.</dc:description>
