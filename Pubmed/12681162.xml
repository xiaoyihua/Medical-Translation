<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe job satisfaction in general practitioners (GP) in the province of Barcelona, and to analyse its relationship with their job burnout, and social and professional characteristics. DESIGN Transversal observational study.Setting. Province of Barcelona, Spain. PARTICIPANTS 603 General Practitioners had participated in ninety three primary care centers. MEASUREMENT Through a direct interview (individual or in group) a validated questionnaire was administered in three parts: general data (social, demographic and professional), job satisfaction (Font Roja-9 dimensions) and job burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory-3 scales). RESULTS The job satisfaction questionnaire (score ranging from 1-5) showed a global satisfaction level of 3.02 (95%CI, 2.98%-3.05%) and we obtained a 18% non response rate. There was a positive association between overall satisfaction and the following variables: less years working in primary health, working in centres providing instruction, and willingness to receive information from the survey. Low levels of satisfaction were associated to high scores in emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation scales, and low scores in personal accomplishment scale. CONCLUSIONS Overall satisfaction has a medium score in the Font-Roja questionnaire. Age seems to lead to a significant tendency to decrease satisfaction as practitioners grow older. Job satisfaction and job burnout present a closely linked behaviour, inversely, as satisfaction increases when job burnout presents low scores.</dc:description>
