<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dapsone (4,4'diaminodiphenyl-sulphone) commonly used in the treatment of patients who suffer from leprosy, is a strongly oxidative drug, producing damage to the red cell membrane. This study investigated whether Vitamin E would have a protective effect on the red cell membrane from oxidant damage caused by Dapsone in patients with leprosy. We have studied 16 patients for 4 months, divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 7) dapsone (DDS): 100 mg/day; Group 2 (n = 9) dapsone: 100 mg/day in addition with Vitamin E: 800 U/day. We did not include patients with low levels of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) because of their sensibility to this drug. At the beginning of the treatment we determined the level of G-6-PD. All patients showed a normocytic normochromic anemia with a decrease in Haptoglobine levels (below 5 mg/dl). Statistical analyses showed that reticulocyte counts did not present significant differences between groups all through evolution. As for methemoglobin (Hi) we observed in Group 1 an increase between the first and the fourth month, which was not seen in group 2. Statistical analyses of the results suggest that oral Vitamin E confers partial protective effect and does not correct the hemolysis parameters produced by Dapsone treatment except for Hi levels which were more sensitive to the oxidant damage.</dc:description>
