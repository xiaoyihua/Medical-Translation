<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Amniotic band syndrome was first described in 1832 by Montgomery, and is characterized by constriction bands that can reach limb amputation. CASE REPORT We report the case of a male neonate born from 17 years old mother, first pregnancy with premature rupture of membranes and eight days of evolution. He was born premature and required resuscitation, with good response. During physical examination injuries by amniotic band in right lower limb and minimal alterations in the left were observed. The most severe injury was amputated and the outcome was favorable so the patient was discharged from the hospital. DISCUSSION The frequency of this syndrome is relatively low and, apparently, is caused by extrinsic factors such as rupture of membranes. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by prenatal ultrasound and treatment depends on the severity of the injury and tissue viability postbrida. Adequate prenatal control is recommended to pregnant patients, especially those with risk factors coupled with ultrasonic control. Treatment of such patients should be multidisciplinary.</dc:description>
