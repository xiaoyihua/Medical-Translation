<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The weight increase that many women experience during menopause may be the result of ageing. However, the precise factors inducing obesity during this period remain to be identified. The object of this study was to determine the type of obesity in a group of women along with its distinctive features, if any, as a function of the menopause stage. PATIENTS AND METHOD The sample consisted of 55 women (22 premenopausal and 33 postmenopausal) with grade I and II obesity. Distribution of body fat, composition of the adipose tissue, size and number of adipocytes, lipidic and hormonal profile as well as nutritional and psychological aspects were all taken into account. RESULTS Postmenopausal women had an android distribution of fat, whereas it was gynoid in premenopausal women. The adipose tissue showed different cell characteristics, the number of fat cells and content of saturated fatty acids (myristic and palmitic) being significantly lower in the postmenopausal group. Menopause was associated with an increase in plasmatic lipids and a decrease in the levels of certain hormones (dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate and insulin). Postmenopausal women tended to have healthier eating habits than premenopausal women, with a significantly lower fat intake but higher carbohydrate and fibre intakes. However, the degree of physical activity was lower than in premenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS The type of obesity differs as a function of the menopausal status, a finding that should be taken into account when establishing a dietetic treatment.</dc:description>
