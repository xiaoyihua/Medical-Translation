<dc:description xml:lang="en">The measurement of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) has been incorporated routinely in Critical Units in order to monitor and control those clinical situations that make us suspicious of intraabdominal hypertension (IAH). There are several methods to measure IAP [1-3]: direct measurement, a catheter inserted through suprapubic aspiration, although it is a discouraged procedure by being very invasive; and indirect measurement. In this method there are mainly three different techniques: Through femoral vein puncture: a catheter into the inferior vena cava is channeled. It is a technique being deprecated invasive, associated with venous thrombosis, retroperitoneal hematoma and infection. Through a gastric tube: impractical, requires managing large amounts of water associated with leakage through the pylorus risk. Through intravesical measurement: is the most commonly used method. The bladder catheter allows monitoring the PIA and diuresis and electrolyte control. This method has potential for infection associated with catheterization risk. Although this risk, it is considered the gold standard for the measurement of IAP. Have now been introduced to the market each measuring intravesical kits guaranteeing sterility circuit without disconnections. It is necessary to know the material and the correct procedure for measuring the PIA and how to interpret the results.</dc:description>
