<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND This paper describes the ponderal distribution of a representative adult population sample of the Community of Valencia (CV) in Spain. Moreover it estimates the prevalence of obesity by sex, age groups and levels of education. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Weight and height data obtained by direct measurement of 1.787 participants in the Survey of Nutrition and Health of the CV in 1994 with a representative population sample of adults over the age of 14. Quetelet's index (QI) (QI - kg/m2) was used as ponderal indicator and established populations with Q1 &gt; or = 30 as being obese. The prevalence of obesity was estimated by age groups, sex and level of education adjusted by the age structure of the same sample. RESULTS The overall prevalence of obesity was 16.4%, 17.8% in women versus 14.7 in men. The obesity varied with age from 3.7% in the 15-24 age group to 32.4% in the 50-64 age group and 28.6% for the over 65 years age group. Obesity was more frequent in men under 34 years, and in women over 50 years of age. In reference to levels of education, a higher prevalence was observed in individuals with a lower education. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study make it evident that the prevalence of obesity in the CV is more than in other autonomous Spanish communities. The frequency of obesity increased with age up to 65 years, and was more prevalent in women and in individuals with lower levels of education.</dc:description>
