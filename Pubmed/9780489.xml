<dc:description xml:lang="en">Gunshot and air weapon wounds in children have become a significant source of morbidity and mortality in our community in the last four years. Ninety five children, 15 years of age and younger, were admitted to the Pediatric Surgical Service for gunshot and air mechanism wounds during this period. Review of the circumstances of injury revealed that more than 50% were accidental 71% were male patients, and 65% were caused by gunshots and outside of the home. Thoracic region was affected in 42%; abdomen, 20%; skull, face and neck, 13.4%; lower extremities, 13.4%; upper extremities 9%; genitalia, 2.0%; and perineal region, 0.8%. Rapid resuscitation and triage of major injury allowed us a survival of 97%. Social service intervention and educational task can offer significant benefit to these children but, ultimately gun control laws with strict enforcement are needed to stop this type of violence toward children.</dc:description>
