<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Cervical cancer is the most common and most lethal gynecological cancer in Mexico. OBJECTIVE To show epidemiological aspects of patients with cervical cancer treated at General Hospital of Mexico with Seguro Popular (free of cost health plan). MATERIAL AND METHOD A retrospective, observational and descriptive study of files from patients with cervical cancer treated at General Hospital of Mexico, from January 2005 to December 2008. RESULTS We attended 1,217 patients, 69% of them came from some state of the country; 725 (59%) only had basic studies and 181 (15%) didn't study; 692 (57%) had their first intercourse before 18 years old; 772 (63%) had more than three children and 629 (55%) never had made a cervical cytology; 1,090 (89%) had diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and 127 (11%) adenocarcinomas; 990 (81%) were invasive carcinomas and 227 (19%) in situ; 580 patients (51%) had FIGO stages 0 and I, and 555 (49%) stages II-IV. For stages 0, the median age was 35 years, for stage I, 42 years; 50 years for stage II, 54 for stage III and 51 for stage IV. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that 69% of the patients came from some state of the country, a frequency of carcinomas in situ lesser than reported at other series in this country and 49% of advanced stages. Most patients had risk factors reported for this disease.</dc:description>
