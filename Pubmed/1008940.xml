<dc:description xml:lang="en">Our clinical files on osteogenesis imperfecta are brought up-to-date reviewing a total of 33,555 cases admitted between 4/XII/48 and 31/VIII/76. From these, 5 clinical cases were found. The extreme rareness of this regional pathology in our Cátedra y Sericio de Pediatría, which is the largest concentration center in Paraguay had led us to make this publication. From our casuistics, we may single out a three-month-old infant which would be a case of congenital osteogenesis imperfecta. The remaining 4 would correspond to cases of late osteogenesis imperfecta. Generalized osteoporosis was present in 3 patients and all of them showed blue sclera the same as fractures of femur. Fractures of radius, tibia and fibula were seen in 2 cases. The humerus was fractured in one patient and the ulna in another one. Three patients were under one year old, another one was on his second year and the last one was a school ager. An audiologic examination was normal in the nine-year-old patient. In the other 4 cases, it was not possible to carry out such test.</dc:description>
