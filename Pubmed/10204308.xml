<dc:description xml:lang="en">The work was done to facilitate the clinical diagnosis and understanding of Rett syndrome (RS) by grouping the symptoms and signs in areas of neurological disfunction. This is a retrospective, longitudinal and observational study of 30 young females whose clinical manifestations were grouped using a modified Fitzgerald et al. scale for motor and behavior evaluation of patients with RS. All patients were videotaped at least during one or several appointments during their follow-up for a period of 1 to 10 years. All patients and videotapes were reviewed independently by the three authors. We followed the clinical diagnostic criteria of classic RS, and grouped the symptoms and signs in 12 groups of clinical phenomenology that represented specific areas of central or peripheral nervous system involvement: 1) dementia syndrome (fronto-temporo-parietal and limbic dysfunction); 2) extrapyramidal syndrome (basal ganglia dysfunction); 3) respiratory function disorders (brain stem reticular system disfunction); 4) sleep disorders (reticular system and limbic dysfunction); 5) epilepsy (cortico-subcortical paroxysmal bioelectrical dysfunction); 6) lower motor neuron syndrome (neuropathic dysfunction and/or peripheral neuropathy); 7) body growth retardation; 8) tonic-postural skeletal deformities; 9) deficit of pain sensation (nociceptive deficit); 10) pseudobulbar dysfunction; 11) autonomic dysfunction and 12) others (microcephaly and bruxism). In clinical practice, we recommend the use of this grouping of symptoms and signs because it makes facilities the clinical study, definition of areas of dysfunction and diagnosis of the patient with RS.</dc:description>
