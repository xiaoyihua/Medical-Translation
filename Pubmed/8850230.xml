<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE With the correlational study of four cases in several areas (clinic, morphoimmunologycal, ultrastructural and genetic) we try to valorate the still controversial entity known as T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma (TRBL), and stablish some useful clues in order to settle down the differential diagnosis between TRBL, Hodgkin's disease (HD), and T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (TNHL). PATIENTS AND METHODS Cases proceeded from Oncology Department, and had been firstly misdiagnosed either as HD (3 cases) or as TNHL (1 case). Biopsies were processed and stained in routine way, H&amp;E, Giemsa and Wilder. Immunohystological study, using monoclonal antibodies against B-cells, T-cells, histiocytes, activation and proliferation markers, was also performed with avidin biotine peroxidase (ABC) method. Ultrastructural study was performed in three of the cases; two patients were studied by PCR and Southern blot. RESULTS All of the cases showed a diffuse hystological pattern, with variable fibrosis, and proliferation of venules and capillaries. Small lymphoid cells, being positive for CD3, were dominant. Large blastic cells, positive for CD20, some of them with a Sternberg-like appearance, could be found, in a spitty pattern. Histiocytes were abundant and positive to CD68. Proliferation index (Ki-67) ranged between 13 and 24.5% being the stain mainly positive for B-cells and in a certain extent, also for T-cells. Ultrastructural features were closer to those of the NHL than to the ones found in HD. Molecular study failed to prove any rearrangement. CONCLUSIONS TRBL is a rare entity between B-cell NHL group. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis (mostly with HD and T-cell NHL) have to be properly made, because of the very distinct prognosis and therapy.</dc:description>
