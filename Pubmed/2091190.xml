<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study represents a retrospective evaluation of 400 ERCP procedures which were done during a lapse from january 1982 to december 1989. It carries out purpose to demonstrate its diagnostic usefulness. Duodenal papilla was suitable cannulated with success in 94.8% with a failure in 5.2%. Specific visualization of desired duct was obtained in 90.5%. Main indication of the method was to elucidate differential diagnosis of jaundice. When biliary duct was cannulated and opacified with success, most important finding was lithiasic disease (37.9%). Pancreatic duct was cannulated, but 69.6% corresponded to normal opacification, in pancreatic pathology, malignant disease was in first scale detected (11.3%). Index of complications was 3.8% of total studies. Minor complications were predominant. Overall mortality was 0.5%. In fact, clinical diagnosis corroborated in 306 cases, sensibility was 99%, specificity 89%, diagnostic exactness 96% with positive predictive value of 96% and negative of 98%.</dc:description>
