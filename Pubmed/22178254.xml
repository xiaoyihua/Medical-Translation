<dc:description xml:lang="en">The National Commission of Rheumatology has developed a satisfaction survey for residents concerning their training period. 37% of the 176 invited to participate answered the survey. 71% said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the influence of the assistance activities during their training. 38% were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with supervision by staff. 39% were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with their training in polarized light microscopy. 52% said no regular meetings were structured to monitor their training. 66% said that there had been no effective evaluation of their training. 39% were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied on the tools they were given to publish at their teaching unit. Overall satisfaction on classroom training for residents of Rheumatology is high. There are opportunities for improvement relating to training in certain techniques, monitoring and evaluation of the training period and training in research skills.</dc:description>
