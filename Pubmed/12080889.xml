<dc:description xml:lang="en">Accelerated changes in source and contents of knowledge, methodologies and scenarios used in learning, and in the meaning and goals of the educational process, are typical of these times. To characterize future needs, roles and expectations of the various actors involved, is also very unreliable and unpredictable. Performing reiterative strategic analysis, monitoring procedures, doing continuous assessment of results and making permanent adaptations in the educational process to the environmental conditions, are unavoidable means to get secure and pertinent effects from the implemented actions. From this perspective, the University of Chile Faculty of Medicine is formulating its proposals to innovate in curriculum, and strengthen its academic resources and students development.</dc:description>
