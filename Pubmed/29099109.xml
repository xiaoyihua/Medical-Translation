<dc:description xml:lang="en">Acute heart failure (HF) is a prevalent disease with important socio-economic repercussions. Due to the aging of population, these values will increase in the coming years, so it may be useful to the implementation of intervention programs in these patients to decrease morbidity and mortality. A quasi-experimental prospective study (n = 262) of patients admitted at the Internal Medicine Department of the Hospital Clínico Universitario Lozano Blesa, in Zaragoza, Spain, diagnosed of HF between November 2013 and October 2014 (both dates inclusive) (n = 108) followed up for 1 year was performed. Within this group, a subgroup with an intensive intervention (n = 30) was performed. The data were compared with a historical cohort of patients admitted to the same department during the same time in the previous year (from November 2012 to October 2013) (n = 154). Statistically significant differences between groups attending to the therapeutical adherence to clinical guidelines (p &lt; 0.011) were observed. Considering the intensive intervention subgroup, statistically significant differences were observed in the rate of exitus (p &lt; 0.032) and survival (log rank &lt;0.030) compared to the control group. The close monitoring of patients with HF improves adherence, reduces mortality and improves survival. This May result in a decline in the use of health resources, which entails significant socio-economic benefits.</dc:description>
