<dc:description xml:lang="en">The incidence, amplitude and frequency spectrum of transitory otoacoustic emissions (TOAE) were analyzed in a sample of 232 normal hearing ears, after click stimulation to determine normal parameters. 116 subjects, 58 female ranging in age from 18 to 30 years, mean age 23.1 years, and 58 male were from 18 to 32 years, mean 23.7 years, were included in this study. TOAE were normal in all ears, 132 (57%) ears had TOAE at all frequencies between 0.5 and 5 kHz. The mean amplitude of TOAE was 16 dB SPL (SD 3.77) and the highest amplitude was elicited at 1-2 kHz frequency. The intensity of stimulation correlated directly with evoked response amplitude and the subject's age correlated inversely with the incidence and amplitude of TOAE.</dc:description>
