<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To develop recommendations for the design and implementation of adverse event notification systems based on the experiences of the Latin American countries. METHODS Employing the qualitative Metaplán methodology, proposals were obtained from 17 experts on adverse event notification systems from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, and Peru and three from the Pan American Health Organization. The characteristics, scope, barriers and constraints, data entry method, type of analysis, and information feedback on adverse event notification systems were reviewed and how to involve professionals in this process was discussed. The proposals were prioritized through an analysis of the responses, debate, and collective deliberation. RESULTS A total of 73 recommendations were obtained on the characteristics that adverse event notification systems should have and 90 on barriers and constraints. There was agreement that legal security for professionals, a culture of safety in health facilities, incentives, a nimble system for providing professionals with results, and a single taxonomy are key to the successful implementation of adverse event notification systems, which must endeavor to protect patient safety in order to improve health care. CONCLUSIONS Adverse event notification systems must be tailored to the needs of each health center. They exist to enable the health system to learn from experience. Confidentiality, anonymity, voluntary participation, a single taxonomy, and legal security for professionals are critical elements of adverse event notification systems.</dc:description>
