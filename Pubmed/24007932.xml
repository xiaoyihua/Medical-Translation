<dc:description xml:lang="en">Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) and Kawasaki disease (KD) are the most frequent systemic vasculitis in childhood. Both diseases are clearly distinct and easily distinguishable. Despite their high frequency, the coexistence of both diseases in the same patient is very rare. The diagnosis of these two diseases is based on clinical features, but sometimes it may be difficult, since signs and symptoms can be atypical and occasionally there are overlapping features among different forms of vasculitis. We present a 5 year-old boy who showed KD and three years later he developed HSP. We discuss similarities and differences between these two systemic vasculitic diseases and make a review of the literature of the few cases reported where KD and PHS have coexisted. Although rare, these two diseases can be present in the same patient and should be treated accordingly.</dc:description>
