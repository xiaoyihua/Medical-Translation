<dc:description xml:lang="en">To describe the clinical and radiologic signs, evolution and response to treatment of patients diagnosed of tracheobronchial granular cell tumors (GCT) in our practice. Retrospective computerized review of all bronchoscopic procedures performed in our hospital from January 1974 through November 1996. Patients with GCT were identified and their case histories reviewed. Eight male patients with 9 GCT were identified. Mean age was 55 years. Only one was symptomatic (hemoptysis) and only one had radiologic signs (solitary pulmonary node). Six patients were diagnosed of tumors in other organs. With the exception of one GCT located in the trachea, all were found in the right bronchial system. Endoscopy revealed mucosal abnormalities in six patients and nodes in three. Treatment was conservative in four patients, endoscopic in three (2 mechanical endoscopic resections and one laser Nd-YAG resection in a patient with two tumors), and surgical in one. Disease evolution as treated was favorable during the observation period. Tracheobronchial GCT are rare tumors. Most patients were between 50 and 70 years old, were often asymptomatic and had few radiologic manifestations. They suffered accompanying neoplasia in other organs. GCT were located in central and segmentary bronchial and nodes or abnormal mucosa could be seen endoscopically. Treatment was conservative, endoscopic or surgical, depending on tumor size and patient characteristics.</dc:description>
