<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objectives of this study were to compare the frequency of dyslipidemia (DLP) and the elevated cardiovascular risk between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and a control group, to identify disease-related factors associated with the presence of DLP and to estimate the frequency of RA patients receiving treatment for DLP. This is a cross sectional study that included 409 RA patients and 624 controls. Cardiovascular (CV) risk was determined using the Framingham score, National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) and the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) adapted versions according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines. DLP was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII). The frequency of CV risk was similar in RA patients and controls, except when NCEP-EULAR adapted version for RA was applied (7% vs. 2%; p = 0.00002). A 43% of patients and 47% of controls had DLP (p = 0.15). RA patients with DLP tended to have extra-articular manifestations more frequently (36% vs. 24%; p = 0.01) and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (21 [13-35] vs. 18 [10-30] mm; p = 0.003). RA patients treated for DLP varied between 11% and 32% according to the definition used. Patients with RA showed an elevated CV risk only when the NCEP-EULAR definition was used. Among RA patients, those with higher ESR and the presence of extra-articular manifestations were more likely to show DLP. The vast majority of patients were not receiving treatment for DLP.</dc:description>
