<dc:description xml:lang="en">Forty nine patients with carcinoma of the cervix treated with a combined method of preoperative radiation therapy (telecobalto and intracavitary) followed by extrafascial hysterectomy are presented. The average age was 39.6 years old. All tumors measured more than 4 cm, in diameter. The staging was lb = 40; lla = 6; llb = 3. The hysterectomy was done average 7.3 weeks after radiation therapy. Postreatment complications were seen in 32.4% and long term complications were found in 8.1% of the cases. After three years of follow up 91% of the patients were free of neoplastic disease. The 40% of the cases has more than three years follow up. There was 14% of total mortality which includes 10.2% of mortality by cancer. The size of the tumor (initially more than 7 cm, in diameter) and the finding of the tumor tissue in the surgical specimens were found of poor prognosis. There was significant statistical difference in survival between the groups with and without cancer cells in the uterus after hysterectomy (p &lt; 0.01).</dc:description>
