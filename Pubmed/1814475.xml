<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this investigation is to compare the fibrinolytic activity in the gingival fluid, of 32 hemophilic patients with 36 normal subjects. Oral examination was carried out in both groups in order to determine the extent of periodontal disease, using the Ramfjord Periodontal Index. The disease was classified in three grades according to the depth of the gingival crevices: grade I: 0 to 3 mm (Normal Deepness); grade II: from 3 to 6 mm; grade III higher than 6 mm. The fibrinolytic activity was measured in fibrin plates, prepared with thrombin and fibrinogen with and without plasminogen. It was found that the fibrinolytic activity was similar in the groups studied and related to the depth of the gingival crevices, with the exception of hemophilic patients with grade I disease, who showed higher fibrinolytic activity in the fibrin plates with plasminogen, than in the corresponding controls (p less than 0.001). This result could possibly be due to mucosal traumatism during the withdrawal of the sample, which permitted the release of plasminogen activators from the damaged vessels. It is important to mention the absence of grade III periodontal disease in the hemophilic group. The reason for this result could be due to the important bleeding occurring in grade II, which induces the patient to seek immediate professional attention. The above mentioned results suggest that the fibrinolytic activity of the gingival fluid in hemophilic and control patients is directly related to the degree of periodontal disease.</dc:description>
