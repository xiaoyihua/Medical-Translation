<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the characteristics of the AUPA Health Centres network, identify the favourable elements and the obstacles when carrying out community projects (CP), the impact of belonging to the AUPA network, and the types of support members expect from the AUPA Network. DESIGN A cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study with analysis of information using quantitative and qualitative techniques. LOCATION Primary Care. PARTICIPANTS 15 centres of Primary Care belonging to the AUPA network before January 2006. PRINCIPAL MEASUREMENTS Variables regarding the characteristics of the Health Centres, professionals, CP, facilitators and obstacles of the CP, usefulness, expectations and impact of belonging to the AUPA network. PRINCIPAL RESULTS The majority of centres are teaching and receive methodological external support. The majority of CP are in initial phases of development and the most used methodology is Community Oriented Primary Care (COPC). The projects have the support of the community and intersectorial collaboration. Nursing is the group most involved. The factors that influence development of the CP are the motivation of the professionals, previous training in community care, management support and the participation of key personnel and the community. The community centres require more time to work on CP, methodological support from experts, better professional recognition, support by the Health Centre management and companies. CONCLUSIONS It is necessary to motivate professionals, promote knowledge in community care, giving recognition and support by the institutions and by the community. Work benefits are perceived from the network: sharing experiences, commitment and gaining knowledge.</dc:description>
