<dc:description xml:lang="en">The secretion of pancreatic juice in response to stimulation of the vagus nerves in the neck, and to injection of parasympathomimetic drugs, was studied in anesthetized rabbits. Vagal stimulation caused a marked increase of protein content in pancreatic juice, and also a small increase in flow of juice, highly variable from one amimal to another, preceded by a short period of inhibition. Atropine supressed vagal effect on protein concentration, but failed to abolish the flow response. Injection of parasympathomimetic drugs closely imitated the results of vagal stimulation, with the difference that secretory action was fully abolished by atropine. The possibility that effects the parasympathetic stimulation on the flow of juice were secondary to vasodilatation, was discussed. The obtained data were compared with those described for other mammalian species, and the conclusion was reached that rabbit behaves like carnivora rather than herbivora.</dc:description>
