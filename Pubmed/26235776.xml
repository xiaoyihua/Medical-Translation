Information was gathered through individual and group interviews. Directed content analysis was carried out. RESULTS Renal sick people and their families face multiple difficulties while on hemodialysis treatment; nevertheless, economic ones are perceived as a priority due to treatment expenses, lack of financial resources and non-coverage of kidney disease by Seguro Popular. Multiple actions are combined in a circular searching for help process to face the economic burden.
