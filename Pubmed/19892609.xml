<dc:description xml:lang="en">Although narcolepsy is a relatively uncommon condition, its impact on a child's life can be dramatic and disabling. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), with brief "sleep attacks" at very unusual times and usually associated with cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle control while awake, resulting in a fall, triggered by laughter). Other symptoms frequently reported are sleep paralysis (feeling of being unable to move or speak, even totally aware), hypnagogic hallucinations (vivid dreamlike experiences difficult to distinguish from reality) or disturbed night time sleep. Some children also experience depression or overweight-obesity. Although narcolepsy has been thoroughly studied, the exact cause is unknown. It appears to be a disorder of cerebral pathways that control sleep and wakefulness, involving dorsolateral hypothalamus and hypocretin. A genetic factor has been suggested, but narcolepsy in relatives is rare. Researchers have suggested that a set of genes combines with additional factors in a person's life to cause narcolepsy. The effective treatment of narcolepsy requires not only medication (usually stimulants, antidepressants and sodium oxybate), but also adjustments in life-style (scheduled naps). Management of this condition in children demands a comprehensive approach to the patient, that includes a correct diagnosis, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment and adjustments in the environment. These strategies can improve the child's self-esteem and ability to obtain a good education.</dc:description>
