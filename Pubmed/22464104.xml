<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES In patients with heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% and sinus rhythm without conditions such as atrial fibrillation, thrombus or history of thromboembolic events, the use of anticoagulation is controversial. Our objective was to evaluate the anticoagulation strategy in these patients, variables associated with its use, and its effects on various cardiovascular events. METHODS Of the patients included in the REDINSCOR registry with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% and sinus rhythm without other anticoagulation indications (including patients with heart failure from 19 Spanish centres), we compared those who received this treatment with the remaining patients. RESULTS Between 2007 and 2010, 2263 patients were included, of whom 902 had left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% and sinus rhythm. Of these, 237 (26%) were receiving anticoagulation therapy. Variables associated with this treatment were a lower left ventricular ejection fraction, ischemic etiology, advanced functional class, wider QRS, larger left atrial diameter, and hospitalization. After 21(11-32) months of median follow-up, there were no significant differences in total mortality (14% versus 12.5%) or stroke (0.8% versus 0.9%). A propensity score adjusted multivariate analysis showed a reduction in a combined end-point including cardiac death, heart transplantation, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular hospitalization (hazard ratio: 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.97; P=.03) in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. No information regarding bleeding was collected in the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In a large and contemporary series of patients with heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% and sinus rhythm, 26% received anticoagulation therapy. This was not associated with lower mortality or stroke incidence, although there was a reduction in major cardiac events.</dc:description>
