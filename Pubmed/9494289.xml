<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper describes the process to design and plan a vaccination campaign against group C N. Meningitidis developed in the Autonomous Community of Galicia between December 9, 1996 and January 31, 1997. We also analyse the results of this process in terms of management results, vaccine coverage and preliminary estimates of effectiveness. A Work group was established, made up of professionals in charge of different intervention areas. A person was designated in charge of the whole campaign and a follow-up and information system was created. The work plan consisted of daily meetings for follow-up, co-ordination and task distribution; and periodical meetings with primary health care and peripheral public health coordinators. Strategies of implantation--in order to make sure the campaign accessibility and acceptability; of budget and of communication with health workers, inhabitants and mass media were developed. Up to 100 tasks were identified to develop the technical information and logistic activities: mailings, meetings, leaflets, ...; purchasing of 584.980 doses of vaccine, supplying to 715 vaccination points (1040 deliveries); problem solving and intervention recording. A vaccination coverage of 85% was achieved, with notification of 8 adverse reactions and 6 errors in the administration of the vaccine (34 children affected). The strategy chosen for the design and planning of the campaign has proven to be effective and valid and sufficient to achieve the final goals, in due time and without problems of misinformation, shortage of vaccine or lack of participation of professionals or people. Mistakes due to incorrect administration of the vaccine, management problems, rupture of the cold chain or recording failures were minimal and accidental.</dc:description>
