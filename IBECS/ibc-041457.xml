<dc:title xml:lang="en">The year 2002 national register on home-based parenteral nutrition</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Aim: To report on the results of the Registry on Home-based Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) of the NADYASENPE working group, corresponding to the year 2002.  Materials and method: Compilation of the registry data loaded by the Units in charge of HPN patients care. It consists of an on-line registry available to the registered users of the group's web page (www.nadya-senpe.com). Epidemiological, diagnostic, access route, complications, hospital admissions, degree of disability, and course until December 31st of 2002.  Results: Data from 74 patients were gathered (56.8% women and 43.2% men), from 18 hospital centers. Mean age of adult patients was 49.4 ± 15.5 years and 2.3 ± 1.1 years for patients younger than 14 years (n = 3 patients). Diseases that prompted the use of HPN were mesenteric ischemia (29.7%), followed by neoplasms (16.2%), radiation enteritis (12.2%), motility impairments (8.1%), and Crohn' s disease (5.4%). Tunneled catheters were used in 52.7% of cases, as compared to 36.5% of subcutaneous reservoirs. Mean treatment duration was 8.7 ± 4.4 months; 68.9% of patients remained on HPN for a duration longer than 6 months, and in 41.9% longer than one year. Patients' follow-up was mainly done from the reference hospital (87.8%), and the remaining patients (12.5%) by the home care team. In no case patients were followed by the primary care team or other specialists than the ones that prescribed nutritional support. In 94 cases there were complications related to nutritional therapy. The more frequent complications presented were infectious. These complications represented 1.84 admissions per patient. The mean number of visits was 12.9 per patient (10.2 routinary visits and 2.7 emergency visits). At the end of the year, we observed that 74.3% patients stayed in the program, whereas in the remaining 23.6% HPN had been discontinued. The main causes for discontinuation were death (52.9%), and switch to oral diet (23.5%) or enteral nutrition (11.8%). With regards to disability degree, 16.1% were confined to a wheelchair or bed, and 17.6% had no disability at all or only a mild social disability.  Conclusions: We observed a sustained HPN prevalence rate in Spain (1.8 patient pmp). The main cause for its use was short bowel syndrome secondary to vascular disease, followed by cancer. Complications associated to nutritional therapy were common, especially of infectious origin (AU)</dc:description>
