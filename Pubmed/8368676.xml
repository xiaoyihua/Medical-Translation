<dc:description xml:lang="en">In our study of the levels of organochlorine compounds (OCC), several factors were taken into account. In the mother, age, diet, place of residency, profession, the number of previous breast-fed children and alcohol and tobacco intake. We then studied the effect of the OCC passed through the placenta. Here, we checked the length of gestation, the birth weight, the cephalic perimeter measurement, the possible neurological alterations such as hypotonie and hyporreflexie and the possible clinical repercussions of the OCC. The OCC studied were, DDT, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH) and isomers alpha, beta and gamma or lindane, dieldrin, heptachloro epoxide (HE) and polychlorobiphenyl compounds (PCB). The samples studies included, blood for the mother and umbilical cord during the delivery, blood from the babies at the ages of one and three months, and the mother's milk (n = 30) and formula milk (n = 20) one and three months after birth. The analytical study was made at the National Institute o Toxicology in Seville with the following methods, gas chromatography, electron capture detector and mass spectrometry. The statistical analysis was based on the Kruskal-Wallis, Shapiro Wilks, Levene, Pooled and Separate tests. We have found that older mothers and those who consumed more fatty meat and blue fish had statistically significant higher levels of OCC. There were also differences depending on the place of residency. The newborn babies with a greater birth-weight and cephalic perimeter measurements also had higher levels of OCC. In these babies, we also found clinical symptoms such as hypotonie and hyporreflexie.</dc:description>
