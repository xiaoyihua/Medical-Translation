<dc:description xml:lang="en">We characterized the acute manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux in 46 patients attending an emergency ward. 43 were females and the mean age was 41 +/- 14. The diagnosis of G-E reflux was confirmed in all by the acid reflux test; esophagitis was present in 55% of patients submitted to endoscopy; the Bernstein test was positive in 43%. The population represents 3% of all emergency consults and 8% of gastroenterological consults. Severe epigastric pain, usually burning or constrictive and radiating to the dorsum, left hypochondrium and sternal region was the presenting form in 55% of patients. Pain was refractory to antispasmodic agents but was relieved by antacids. Dyspnea or bronchial obstruction was the main symptom in 16% of cases, heartburn in 13%, hematemesis in 6%. Among these patients a prolonged history of chronic G-E reflux was common. Surgical correction was undertaken in 6%, with some symptoms persisting in 17%.</dc:description>
