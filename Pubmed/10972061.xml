<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To compare the results of two educational interventions, habitual versus experimental, in a group of pediatric residents. METHODS We evaluated 7 residents in the last 4 months of their first year training by incorporating additional hours of an Experimental Intervention (EI) to their Habitual Training (HT). During EI we forced group discussion and debate in the classroom activities in contrast with the HT which was a passive approach of lectures with little or no participation by the trainees. We used a previously developed Differential Scale of a Group Interaction (DSGI) to score groupal activities conducive to better learning during EI and HT at 1, 6 and 11 weeks of starting EI. Simultaneously, the individual participations were scored with an Observation Guide of Discussion and Debate (OGDD) but only during EI as it would score near zero during HT. RESULTS The DSGI scores were significantly and increasingly higher during EI than during HI at 1, 6 and 11 weeks of EI. All trainees improved their OGDD score after 6 and 11 weeks of EI. CONCLUSIONS The educational microenvironment created by the Experimental Intervention improved the knowledge and aptitudes for discussion and debate of the trainees. Their increased use of critical exchanges and confrontations of ideas contributed to a better construction of their knowledge as pediatric residents.</dc:description>
