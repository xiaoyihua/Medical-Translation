<dc:description xml:lang="en">At present times, numerous complaints claiming defects produced at some point in the process of obtaining informed consent are filed in courts of justice; in these complaints there is an underlying comment element which is the roles that health professionals have in these processes. In obtaining this consent, one can see this more as a means to obtain judicial protection for professional practices rather than this process being a respectful exercise for the dignity and freedom which health service patients have. This article reflects on two basic rights related to informed consent: adequately obtaining this consent and the need to protect those people who lack, either partially or totally, the capacity to make this decision by themselves. Afterwards, the author makes some considerations about the necessity to obtain informed consent for nursing practices and treatment.</dc:description>
