<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the level of work satisfaction of health professionals working in Primary Care and to establish the social, demographic and professional factors which determine it. DESIGN An observational, crossover study using a self-administered questionnaire. SETTING Primary Care. PARTICIPANTS All the doctors and nurses working in the Primary Care teams in the Albacete Health Area (468 in all). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The scale of work satisfaction of health professionals in Primary Care teams was used. Social, demographic and professional data were collected. 9 dimensions or components of work satisfaction were identified through a factorial analysis. The lowest scores were for motivation, opportunities for professional development and coordination with specialists. CONCLUSIONS The findings show, in general, indifference as to work satisfaction or lack of it in areas such as motivation and opportunities for professional development. The differences observed in those polled relate to their job and work-place, and also, in the case of doctors, to specialist training.</dc:description>
