<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent Public Health Care problem that causes an increase in morbidity, mortality and number of hospital admissions as well as increased costs in care services in this population group. The clinical indicator that determine readmission and/or death are analyzed in a 12 month follow-up period. METHODS All T2DM patients admitted in Spanish Internal Medicine Services between two different periods (june 1-15, 2003 and november 1-15) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Primary endpoint were readmission and/or death in the year following the first admission. RESULTS Population of the study (n = 482) was distributed in 229 males (47.5%) and 253 females (52.5%). Mean age was 73.48 +/- 8.86 years. A total of 210 (43.6%) were not readmitted to the hospital and/or died in the follow-up and 272 (56.4%) were readmitted and/or died. The latter 272 patients had a significantly greater percentage of heart failure (odds ratio [OR] 1.760; 1.073-2.886), atrial fibrillation (OR 1.747; 1.010- 3.022) and previous history of systolic blood pressure (OR 0.400; 0.241-0.666). They also showed increased levels of plasma glucose (OR 1.004; 1.001-1.007), and lower concentration of plasma hemoglobin (OR 0.756; 0.677-0.845) and creatinine clearance (OR 0.985; 0.976-0.994). CONCLUSIONS T2DM patients who are admitted to the Internal Medicine Services in Spain are elderly patients with elevated indices of readmission and death in a short follow-up period (one year). The coexistence of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, renal dysfunction deterioration and decrease in hemoglobin levels may predict this worse outcome.</dc:description>
