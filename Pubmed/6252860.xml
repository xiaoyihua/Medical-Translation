<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cell migration was inhibited when Entamoeba histolytica antigen-sensitized peritoneal exudate cells were cultured in the presence of specific antigen. The inhibition of cell migration was caused due to interaction of antigen with sensitized lymphocytes. This migration inhibition was well correlated with cell mediated immune responses, but not with circulating antibody levels. Peritoneal cells obtained from animals immunized with 70.5 microgram of antigen gave a better response in capillary tube tests. It was further found that 0.88 microgram antigen constitutes an optimum dose for studying migration inhibition reaction. The results obtained from the capillary and agarose plate technics show a slight disparity due to a difference in the respective specificities of the two tests. Agarose plate technic appears to be rather specific for pure antigen samples, while the capillary tube test is more appropriate for crude type antigens.</dc:description>
