<dc:description xml:lang="en">Nutrient Energy Malnutrition (NEM) is a common feature among liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, and might constitute a negative predictor of patient's survival. A prospective descriptive study was carried out in order to assess the influence of LC patient's nutritional status on the occurrence of complications and mortality in a tertiary care health institution in Havana City (Cuba). One-hundred twenty-one patients were recruited for the study (Women: 52.9%; Younger than 60 years: 59.0%; Whites: 90.0%). C virus infection, alcoholism, and B virus infection accounted for 71.0% of LC cases. Ninety-two percents of the patients had less than 5 yearse of diagnosis. Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) of nutritional status returned a 45.0% of malnutrition. Malnutrition was associated with disease progression: twenty-one percent of A Child-Pugh Stage patients was malnourished, but this rate increased to become 90.0% among those in C stage. Fat and skeletal muscle compartments were reduced in 36.0 and 37.0% of the patients, respectively. Complications affected 44.6% of the patients. Sixty percent of them were malnourished (p &lt;0.01). One-year mortality rate was 11.0%. Ninety-two percent of deceased patients were malnourished (p &lt; 0.01). LC malnourished patients have greater risk of complications and death as compared to well-nourished ones.</dc:description>
