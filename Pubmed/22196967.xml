<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To estimate kidney cancer incidence and prevalence in Spain, based on mortality and survival data from the period 1998-2007, and to provide projections of incidence, prevalence and mortality until the year 2022. MATERIAL AND METHODS All-cause and kidney-cancer mortality rates were obtained from the National Statistics Institute and survival data were obtained from the EUROCARE study. Estimations were carried out using the MIAMOD program. The Joinpoint program was used to quantify the expected annual change in the projections. RESULTS An increase in the incidence rate is expected in men from, this going from 11.92 (Adjusted Rate - AR=8.66) per 100,000 inhabitants/year to 15.7 (AR=9.55). Prevalence would increase from 72.84 (AR=51.62) to 94.47 (AR=59.57), and mortality would increase from 5.77 (AR=7.29) to 7.29 (AR=4.56). The incidence rate in women would increase from 5.56 (AR=3.86) to 26.77 (AR=16.4). Prevalence would increase from 24.6 (AR=17.28) to 133.69 (81.37), and for mortality, the expected increase would be from 2.46 (AR=1.54) to 11.65 (AR=6.56) cases per 100.000 inhabitants/year. CONCLUSION The projections indicate that kidney cancer in Spain follows an increasing trend in incidence, mortality and prevalence. This needs to be considered in order to plan more effective prevention and treatment measures.</dc:description>
