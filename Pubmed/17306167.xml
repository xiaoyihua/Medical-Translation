<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To show that children from 1 to 4 years old suffering malnutrition who are treated with soya have a better chance of recovering height and weight. DESIGN Observational, prospective, case-control study. SETTING Family Medicine Unit No. 52, Cuautitlán Izcalli, Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS For this survey, a sample of 83 undernourished children from 1 to 4 years old was taken and 3 experimental and 3 control groups were formed. The first group held children from 1 to 2 years old; the second group, from 2 years one month to 3 years old; and the third group, from 3 years one month to 4 years old. The study lasted for 12 months. RESULTS We found that the experimental group from 1 to 2 years old increased in weight and size by over 80%, whilst the weight and size gain in the other groups was significant, but not as much as expected. CONCLUSIONS It is important to emphasize that there was greater impact in the group given soya, in which there was clear improvement. The degree of malnutrition dropped and in some cases nutritional status was restored. We can affirm that, if mothers' understanding improved, malnutrition could be prevented by proper training.</dc:description>
