<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to quantify the efficiency of the cognitive-behavioural treatment for smoking cessation in pregnancy and to evaluate the risk factors of success or failure for the abstinence before the childbirth. PATIENTS AND METHOD We studied 74 pregnant smoking women who, between January 2003 and January 2004, came to their obstetric regular control in the Hospital Casa Maternitat-Hospital Clínic i Provincial de Barcelona, and who voluntarily acceded to the cognitive-behavioural treatment without replacement of nicotine for the smoking cessation that they were offered. RESULTS 44% of women who made the program of visits came abstinent to the childbirth, and of them, 93.1% was abstinent during the quarantine. 51.5% reduced the consumption and 4.5% didn't change or increased the consumption. The fact that someone smokes at home (p = 0.006), the degree of dependence to the nicotine (p = 0.015) and a consumption of coffee superior to 3 daily cups (p = 0.039), in an equation of logistic regression, classified both groups (abstinence/not abstinence). CONCLUSIONS The efficiency of a program based on cognitive-behavioural therapy, without replacement of nicotine, for the smoking cessation in the pregnancy is confirmed in our sample. We propose to consider risk factors of treatment failure the fact that someone smokes at home and a daily high consumption of coffee.</dc:description>
