<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Carbohydrate-Deficient Transferrin (CDT) is a new marker for excessive alcohol drinking. It appears to be useful to detect alcoholism, harmful consumption and relapse. It have been introduced in our country recently. METHOD Recent studies about utility of CDT have been reviewed. RESULTS Sensitivity and specificity of CDT level as a marker of alcoholism were 72-97% and 31-81% respectively. As a marker of harmful consumption its sensitivity was 15-69% and its sensitivity was higher than 82%. CDT was demonstrated to be a effective maker for evaluating alcoholic abstinence in alcoholic patients. CONCLUSIONS CDT determinations have a high specificity for screening heavy drinking in different settings. Problems related to its sensitivity are discussed.</dc:description>
