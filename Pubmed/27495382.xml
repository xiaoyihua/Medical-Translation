<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE An outbreak of Serratia marcescens infections outbreak is described, as well as the epidemiological study that linked the outbreak to the use of 2% aqueous chlorhexidine antiseptic. METHOD In late November 2014 an increasing incidence of S. marcescens isolates was detected in patients treated in the emergency department. It was considered a possible outbreak, and an epidemiological investigation was started. RESULT S. marcescens was isolated in 23 samples from 16 patients and in all new bottles of two lots of 2% aqueous chlorhexidine. The contaminated disinfectant was withdrawn, and the Spanish Drugs Agency was alerted (COS 2/2014). The epidemiological study showed that strains isolated from clinical samples and from chlorhexidine belonged to the same clone. No further isolates were obtained once the disinfectant was withdrawn. CONCLUSION The suspicion of an outbreak and the epidemiological study were essential to control the incidence.</dc:description>
