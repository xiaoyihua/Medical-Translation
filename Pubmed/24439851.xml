<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To establish a simple, reproducible and safe experimental model, for the development of ischemic vascular necrosis of the hip in the lamb. MATERIAL AND METHODS We used 15 lambs (10 males and 5 females) aged four weeks, divided into a control group (7 animals) and an experimental group (8 animals) producing ischemia in the proximal femur. Standard radiography and MRI were performed. The animals were euthanised at the 4th, 8th and 12th weeks after surgery. The femoral heads were extracted and measured and a histological analysis was performed with hematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS Decreased height and increased width of the femoral head was observed in the X-Rays, particularly after the 4th week. We did not observe any changes in the height of the lateral pillar or trochanteric distance. The experimental group showed macroscopical hypertrophy and progressive flattening of the head. At 4 weeks necrotic areas in articular cartilage were observed, bone marrow was dense and the growth cartilage height was lower. The vessels were thickened by proliferation of the medial and adventitia layers. At 8 weeks, we found fibrosis in the subchondral bone with thinned and devitalized angiogenesis fat areas. The articular cartilage showed irregularities. At 12 weeks the closure of the physis was noted, as well as chondral areas in the trabecular bone and fat cells in the methaphysis. CONCLUSION Although the histological changes are consistent with necrosis of the femoral head, the images obtained did not resemble Perthes disease, so we do not advise this experimental model for the study of this disease.</dc:description>
