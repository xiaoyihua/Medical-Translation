<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To review the preventive and prophylactic aspects of epilepsy. DEVELOPMENT The description of the prevention of the causes of epilepsy includes the measures to prevent epilepsy and epileptic seizures. The concept of antiepileptogenesis is discussed according to the available information about the role that both the classic and new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) play in this process. Neuroprotection is discussed in the context of the mechanisms of action of the AEDs and of the mechanisms of neuronal lesion produced by the causes of epilepsy or by the seizures themselves. Among the new therapeutic modalities the current knowledge about the vagus nerve stimulator and the surgical treatment is summarized. The potential future therapeutic modalities include alternative medicine, pharmacologic treatment of the epileptogenic focus, genetic treatment and vaccination. CONCLUSIONS The first step in preventing epilepsy is to avoid the causes or the risk factors. Some classic AEDs have demonstrated to be effective in the prophylaxis of provoked seizures (acute, symptomatic) but not of unprovoked seizures (epileptic). The best knowledge of the pathogenesis and the molecular and biological basis of epileptogenesis secondary to lesional causes, suggest that antioxidant and neuroprotective agents, including the new AEDs, may prevent epilepsy. There is a need to design studies with the goal of demonstrating their antiepileptogenic and/or neuroprotective activity at different ages in life. New and future therapeutic modalities may offer additional preventive options.</dc:description>
