<dc:description xml:lang="en">Research has a very important role in the financial development of countries; it improves our life quality in all aspects and helps to face unexpected happenings. In Spain science has been left to a second plane and we feel necessary to reverse this situation. Amongst the different kinds of research (basic, clinical and translational) the two last ones are most interesting for clinical doctors. Training of the doctor in the research field helps to a better practice as the advances in research can be applied to clinical practice. There is a tendency for doctors to be involved less in research and it is very important to modify this situation. Research should start in Medical school and play an important role throughout the training period. Once training has concluded, those with capacity and interest in research should follow a 3-4 years training in the field and after that period they can undertake both clinical and research roles. Finally, in Spain our speciality needs to create specific research laboratories in those ENT departments in hospitals with adequate infrastructure to develop research.</dc:description>
