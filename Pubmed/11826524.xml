<dc:description xml:lang="en">Kidney transplantation is at present the most efficient therapeutic tool to treat end-stage chronic kidney failure. Graft rejection and infections are the most important barriers to the success of transplantation, whereas cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been the most reported causal agent of morbidity in this type of patients. The evolution of a group of 12 patients who underwent kidney transplantation at the Nephrology Institute was studied during 16 weeks aimed at monitoring the infection caused by CMV. 58.4% of these patients were positive and 28% showed clinical evidences of the disease. Most of the infected patients were observed between the 4th and the 12th week after transplantation. CMV infection was confirmed in 70% of the individuals undergoing a high immunosuppression. 50% of the total of patients developed graft rejection episodes some time during the evolution and 83.3% were diagnosed CMV infection.</dc:description>
