<dc:description xml:lang="en">In a five year period 75 colonoscopies were carried out in 66 children with rectal bleeding. Five patients presented with severe anemia. Their age ranged from 2 to 16 years (mean 6.6). Most of the procedures were performed on an outpatient basis (87%) and under oral sedative premedication (78%). At least the splenic flexure was reached in each case. We found 59 polyps in 47 children (71%). All polyps were snared and removed during the same procedure. There were no serious complications. Colonoscopy is a most usefull diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in children with rectal bleeding, where there is a high probability that a juvenile polyp can be found which can be safely treated during the same session.</dc:description>
