<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of the present paper was to evaluate the effect of fenticonazole and to compare it with that of ketoconazole and nystatin in the topical treatment of oral chronic candidosis. Eighty patients diagnosed with erythematous chronic candidosis were divided into four groups, according to the cream they were provided with 3% fenticonazole, 2% fenticonazole, 100000UI nystatin, and 2% ketoconazole in orabase respectively. A clinical assessment was made at 7, 15, 30 and 45 days. Fifty-one of them finished the trial. ANOVA, Kruskall Wallis and Wilcoxon tests were applied for statistical analysis. There was a significative decrease of the oral lesions in all groups (p 0.0001). The remission grade was also analysed according to the localisation: lesions in the buccal mucosa and in the comissure all the patients achieved complete resolution, whereas tongue and palate lesions showed a significative decrease in all the treatments (p 0.00001). Fenticonazole proved to be as effective as nystatin and ketoconazole in topical treatment of oral candidosis.</dc:description>
