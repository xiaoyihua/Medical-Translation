<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Microbiologic diagnosis of conjunctival ophthalmomyiasis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Material extracted from three patients' conjunctiva who complained of sudden presence of foreign body and were diagnosed as conjunctival ophthalmomyiasis has been studied. Patients were recruited over two months from the Emergency Department. Diagnosis was performed through observation using the light microscope. RESULTS Oestrus ovis first-instance larvas were observed in all the samples studied. CONCLUSIONS This observation of similar cases in a short period of time and the low frequency of diseased people who lived in a urban environment makes necessary to think in this agent as cause of ophthalmomyiasis in our area and therefore perform an adequate differential diagnosis.</dc:description>
