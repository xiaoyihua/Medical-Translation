<dc:description xml:lang="en">Transitional cell carcinoma of bladder coexisting with prostate adenocarcinoma is one of the most common tumor associations and accounts for 1.1% of all bladder and prostate tumors seen at our setting. The cases observed (13) were far greater than those expected (2.62) relative to the number of patients studied, length of follow-up, and the incidence rate for both tumor types (p less than 0.001). Superficial bladder tumors were treated with TUR combined with intravesical chemotherapy, whereas deep tumors were submitted to radical surgery when patient condition permitted, otherwise resorting to adjunctive chemotherapy. For prostate tumors, the treatment of choice was TUR plus adjunctive hormone therapy by subalbuginea orchidectomy and/or oral anti-androgen agents, except for A1 tumors or those where radiotherapy formed part of the treatment regimen for bladder cancer. No coadjuvant hormone therapy was instituted in this latter case. A clear correlation (77% for superficial and 50% for deep bladder tumors) was observed between the adjusted 5-year survival rate and tumor stage. For prostate tumors this was 100, 50 and 0% for stages A, B and C-D, respectively. The 5-year survival rate for the 13 cases was 71%. The mean survival was 62 and 20 months for superficial and deep bladder tumors, respectively, and 72, 40 and 35 months for tumor stage A, B and C-D, respectively.</dc:description>
