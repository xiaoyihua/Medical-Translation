<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES This study shows the results of an incidental analysis of the prevalence rate of childhood depression (dysthymia and major depression) obtained in an epidemiological cross-study. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was carried out among Madrid's school-aged population from primary schools (3 degrees, 4 degrees and 5 degrees EGB). The sample included a total of 1,275 children, both boys and girls, between 8 and 11 years old. They were chosen at random from different school systems (public, semi-public and private) and educational levels (3 degrees, 4 degrees and 5 degrees EGB). The definition of "case" is based on Poznanski's semi-structured clinical interview (Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised, 1984) depending on DSM-III-R's operational criterion for dysthymia and major depression symptomatology. RESULTS The prevalence rates obtained in the general school-aged population were 6.1% for dysthymia and 4% with major depression. The total rate of depressive disorders was 10.1%.</dc:description>
