<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the contribution of SPECT-CT lymphoscintigraphy in selective sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with newly diagnosed malignant melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective study was made between July 2009 and October 2010. It included 63 patients diagnosed with melanoma (32 men and 31 women) with mean age of 55 years (range: 25-88) and inclusion criteria for SLNB. The melanomas were located as follows: 28 in trunk, 5 in head and neck, 16 in upper limbs and 17 in lower limbs. Three patients had two melanomas. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed after pericicatricial/perilesional injection of 74MBq of (99m)Tc-labeled nanocolloid human serum albumin, obtaining early planar images, late whole body study and sectorial images and SPECT-CT in the area of interest. Planar scintigraphy findings were compared with SPECT-CT. RESULTS The sentinel node (SN) was localized by planar imaging in 62/63 (98%) of patients. SPECT-CT study located the SN in all the patients with a detection rate of 100%. The number of SNs detected with SPECT-CT was higher than with the planar study in 27 patients. The SPECT-CT provided additional information (change in location and/or in its accuracy in the localization of location uncertain SN) in 14/63 (22.2%) patients, involving changes in the surgical approach and lymph node staging. CONCLUSION SPECT-CT detects a higher number of SN than planar lymphoscintigraphy in patients with melanoma. Its contribution is more relevant in the melanomas located on the trunk, head and neck. SPECT-CT modified the SN location by 22% compared to planar scan findings, facilitating a correct surgical approach.</dc:description>
