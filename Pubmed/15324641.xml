<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyze the reliability and validity of the domains of the Child Health and Illness Profile-Child Edition Parent Report Form (CHIP-CE/PRF) included in the Barcelona Health Survey conducted in 2000 and to obtain population-based reference values. METHODS Data were obtained from proxy-respondent interviews of children aged 5-14 years old (n = 836) participating in the Barcelona Health Survey 2000. The 4 subdomains of the parent version of the CHIP-PRF included in the health survey were: satisfaction with health, and physical discomfort, emotional discomfort, and limitation of activities of the discomfort domain. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficients. An exploratory factor analysis was carried out and analysis of covariance was performed to assess the construct validity of the subdomains. RESULTS In all the subdomains assessed, Cronbach's alpha was above 0.70 (range, 0.76-0.98). In the factorial analysis, almost all the items (31/35) presented the highest load in their corresponding subdomain. Most of the expected mean differences among groups were confirmed. Girls aged 10-14 years old scored the lowest, both in satisfaction with health (48.93; 95% confidence interval [CI 95%], 47.40-50.47) and in discomfort (48.87; CI 95%, 47.51-50.22). No differences were found according to the social class of the head of the family. CONCLUSIONS The present study provides a useful measure of perceived health status in a child health survey.</dc:description>
