<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The end stage renal disease confers a high morbidity and mortality risk, mainly due to cardiovascular disease. The cardiac T troponin and carbohydrate antigen-125 (CA-125) are useful biomarkers to determine cardiovascular prognosis in order to start preventive treatment in the high risk patients. METHODS We included patients with end stage renal disease in hemodialysis treatment. Plasma high sensitivity cardiac T troponin (hs-TNT) and CA-125 were measured at the beginning of follow up. The patients with clinical evidence of an acute myocardial infarction were excluded. Twelve month after the measurement of the biomarkers the patients were called to assess the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and hospitalizations for any reason. RESULTS Eighty seven patients were included. The mean age was 5815 years, and 76% were male. The hs-TNT was elevated in 95.4% of the patients and the median value was 49 ng/l (15.3 - 214.1). CA-125 median value was 13.7 U/ml (6.1 - 52.7). The patients that presented a MACE had higher CA-125 (p&lt; 0.03) and hs-TNT (p &lt;0.001); and all of them had a troponin value ≥ 69.37 ng/l. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of high hs-TNT was 95.4% and of CA-125 10%. MACE were significantly higher in patients with elevated biomarkers, conferring them prognostic utility in this group of patients.</dc:description>
