<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) is considered the most common variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and is characterized by the clinical triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia. Respiratory involvement and relapses are unusual. Patients with MFS usually have a good recovery and no residual deficits. We describe the clinical features, associated infections and evolution in eight patients with MFS. PATIENTS AND METHOD Eight cases of MFS and sixty-one of GBS were studied between 1994 and 2003. All cases showed the clinical triad of MFS without major limb weakness or other signs suggestive of CNS involvement. RESULTS The proportion of MFS with respect to GBS during the same period was 13.1%. Four had a positive serology for Epstein-Barr virus, Salmonella enteritidis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Our cases showed facial palsy (75%), dysphagia (75%), pupillary abnormalities (37.5%) and ventilation support (37.5%). Antiganglioside antibodies, determined in three cases (4 episodes), were positive [GQ1b (50%) and GD1b (50%)]. In all cases, there was a markedly reduced amplitude of the distal sensory as well as frequent axonal degeneration signs. The oldest three patients relapsed and required ventilation support. CONCLUSIONS We report for the first time an association between S. enteritidis and C. pneumoniae and MFS. Older patients in our series suffered a faster disease progression with need of ventilation support. We conclude that an older age correlates with poor prognosis and relapses.</dc:description>
