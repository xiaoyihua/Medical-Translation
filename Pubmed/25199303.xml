<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The ERCP procedure requires the use of fluoroscopy with the subsequent exposure to ionizing radiation. The doses received by patients, physicians and assistants in the endoscopy have never been recorded in our area. This analysis describes the findings of the MIRED_Uy study (measuring radiation in digestive endoscopy in Uruguay). Objective. To determine radiation exposure received by patients, physicians and assistants during ERCP. METHODS Data were collected from 33 procedures conducted by four endoscopists, supported by endoscopy assistants. All staff took basic radiation-protection measures. The magnitudes measured were the kerma area product (KAP) for the patient and the effective dose (E) and the equivalent doses in hand (HM) and lens of the eyes (HC) for the operators. RESULTS Mean value for PKA was 24 Gy.cm2 (range: 0.04-71) equivalent to 312 chest x-rays. The mean fluoroscopy time was 2.3 minutes (range: 0.45 a 5.70 minutes). The E mean per procedure was 3.69, 5.14 y 3.69 muSv, for physician, first and second assistant respectively. The dose in hand for the physician was 19.4 muSv and the dose in lens was 7.94 muSv. CONCLUSIONS The first results of measuring ERCP radiation doses in Uruguay are presented These procedures expose the patient and staff to measurable radiation doses, which should be taken into account to minimize their risks.</dc:description>
