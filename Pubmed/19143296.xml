<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES There is no formal agreement or criteria utilized to establish a standard of treatment in children with antenatally diagnosed HN. METHODS We analyzed our own experience in addition to the protocols attending to this subject. Twenty eight (28) children with unilateral HN were assessed from October 1999 through October 2005 and the anteroposterior diameter of renal pelvis (APDP) was measured. RESULTS Patients underwent surveillance with US and cintilography in 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. The treatment results were reviewed following the classification of Society of Fetal Urology: slight (2 to 5 mm), moderate (6 to 10 mm) and severe (&gt; 10-15 mm). CONCLUSIONS We concluded that slight HN would never be operated on while the severe ones would always be. The moderate HN, on the other hand, would remain under surveillance with US and cintilography for two years.</dc:description>
