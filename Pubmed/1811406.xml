<dc:description xml:lang="en">Traditionally, Pick's ideational apraxia has been considered a neurologist's realm since it is one of the permanent manifestations of brain lesions located in the left hemisphere posterior territory. Besides, however, the ideational apraxia is likely to appear--altogether with misidentifications and spatial disorientation--as a part of the transient manifestations of confusional psychosis. It is thus quite possible that a reversible alteration of the posterior brain mechanisms could be the basis for the confusional psychosis. It seems also reasonable to include the ideational apraxia within the symptoms to be sought in those cycloid psychotic states including confusional psychosis. This is why it can safely be said that Pick's ideational apraxia is also a psychiatrist's realm.</dc:description>
