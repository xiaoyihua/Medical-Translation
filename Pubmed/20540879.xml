<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Urinary symptoms Overactive Bladder (OAB) and Urinary Incontinence (UI) result in an important personal and economic impact. This work concentrates on the detailed analysis of OAB and UI (derived symptoms and tendencies in medical consultation and resource consumption), in a sample of working women aged 25-64. MATERIAL AND METHODS Study within the framework of the EPICC study of the Spanish Association of Urology (epidemiologic, observational, multicentric, national study) and concentrates on the detailed analysis of the characteristics of the sample of working women aged 25-64 (N=3090) and of the subgroup of individuals with VH and/or IU (N=307). RESULTS 4.01% of the subjects presented UI alone, 2.69% OAB alone, 3.24% presented both pathologies. There exists association between UI and/or VH presence and frequent urinary infections, hypertension and diabetes. Taking into account individuals with UI and/or OAB, 28.01% had problems to retain urine, and 16.94% suffered leakage daily; 27.36% suffered uncontrollable urge to urinate daily; 57.65% had never sought medical advice, 35.40% had visited an specialist, 23.13% would like to visit an specialist in incontinence; 28.01% had received treatment, from which 55.81% had received physiotherapy and 25.58% pharmacologic treatment. CONCLUSION In this study, specific data about VH and IU in working women aged 25-64 are presented, including those referring to the magnitude of these conditions and use of sanitary resources in subjects with UI and/or OAB, aiming at contributing to a better diagnose and handling of patients and resources.</dc:description>
