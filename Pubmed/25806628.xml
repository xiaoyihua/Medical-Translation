<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS to evaluate the accuracy of the Braden and Waterlow risk assessment scales in critically ill inpatients. METHOD this prospective cohort study, with 55 patients in intensive care units, was performed through evaluation of sociodemographic and clinical variables, through the application of the scales (Braden and Waterlow) upon admission and every 48 hours; and through the evaluation and classification of the ulcers into categories. RESULTS the pressure ulcer incidence was 30.9%, with the Braden and Waterlow scales presenting high sensitivity (41% and 71%) and low specificity (21% and 47%) respectively in the three evaluations. The cut off scores found in the first, second and third evaluations were 12, 12 and 11 in the Braden scale, and 16, 15 and 14 in the Waterlow scale. CONCLUSION the Braden scale was shown to be a good screening instrument, and the Waterlow scale proved to have better predictive power.</dc:description>
