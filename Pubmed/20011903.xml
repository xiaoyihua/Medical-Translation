<dc:description xml:lang="en">This article presents an analysis of the partial results from a quantitative study that addresses the perspective of drug users' family and friends regarding the treatment of problems resulting from the use of illicit drugs. Participants were 104 health service users in Bogotá. Of the participants, 58% consider that drug use is a disease that needs treatment; 56% stated the general hospital as the main alternative for treatment; 95% reported that the state accounted for this situation. Participants were more acquainted with private institutions, with therapeutic communities and religious groups being reported as the ones with the strongest commitment to the problem. For 73% of participants, the existing services are inappropriate and of difficult use and access. Stigma is the main barrier for a person to seek health care, and only 50% believe there is any use in treatments. There is a need for broader dissemination of the existing resources so as to increase their implementation and use.</dc:description>
