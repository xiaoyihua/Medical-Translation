<dc:description xml:lang="en">Infants and toddlers represent a risk population for iron deficiency (ID), due to their relatively high requirements, which are frequently associated with a poor intake of iron-rich foods. A possible association between ID and impaired cognitive and psychomotor development has been described, and it has been suggested that some of these effects can be irreversible. For this reason, prevention of ID has become a subject of much concern. To promote an adequate dietetic iron intake is the most important approach for the prevention of ID. Exclusive breast-feeding provides adequate amounts of iron during the first 4-6 months of life, and iron-fortified formula should be used when an alternative is necessary. Fortified cereals and foods containing haem iron, such as meat, should be introduced early in complementary feeding. In toddlers, iron requirements can be satisfied with a daily consumption of at least one serving of iron-containing foods, along with enhancers of iron absorption. When daily requirements are not properly met by food intake, and in some high-risk populations, screening for ID and iron supplementation should be considered.</dc:description>
