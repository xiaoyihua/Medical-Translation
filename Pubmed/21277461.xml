<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To study the incidence of infectious keratitis (IK) after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), along with its diagnosis, therapeutic action taken, its management and the results. MATERIAL AND METHOD We carried out a retrospective study of 262,191 eyes intervened consecutively with LASIK, in our 20 centres, during the period from September 2002 and December 2009. All the cases susceptible to being diagnosed with IK, either clinically or due to the biological findings were analysed. RESULTS A total of 82 cases were found with infectious keratitis, which assumed an incidence of 0.031%. Distributions are presented by gender, mean age of the patients, mean days since the surgery, the clinical signs and symptoms, predisposing factors, therapeutic action, complications, details of the causal germ, and the loss of lines of vision. CONCLUSIONS Infectious keratitis after LASIK is a rare complication. The early diagnosis and management of the process are determining factors when establishing the prognosis. In our series all the cases were resolved without causing any other serious complications.</dc:description>
