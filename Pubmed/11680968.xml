<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper identifies the trends and recent progress in the generation and reproduction of knowledge on health economic evaluation. Analysis is organized along nine public health action fields, namely: health determinants and predictors, economic value of health, healthcare demand, healthcare supply, microeconomic evaluation of healthcare, healthcare market balance, evaluation of policy instruments, general evaluation of the health system, and healthcare planning, regulation and supervision. Each action field is defined to place the reader in the proper setting and level of analysis. In addition, thematic research topics developed in each action field are proposed and discussed. The generation and reproduction of knowledge on the different action fields was based on the review of the bibliographic databases MEDLINE and LILACS for the 1992-2000 period. Results lead to the conclusion that development and application of economic evaluation of healthcare has been uneven across different countries and that there is a growing increase of applications starting in 1994, the year of initiation of healthcare reform in Latin America.</dc:description>
