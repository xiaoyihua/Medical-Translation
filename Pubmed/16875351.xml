<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Embryo donation displays special characteristics within the Latin American context, where spare cryopreserved embryos are not currently available as is the case of industrialized countries. The Catholic church also plays a significant role. The need to regulate ethically and legally the practice of embryo donation suggests that we need to take into account the opinions from the main key players: patients, health professionals, and society. The objective of this study is to explore the patients perceptions vis a vis potential embryo donation for research purposes. MATERIALS AND METHODS A descriptive, cross-sectional design included a tape recorded semi-structured interview administered to 32 patients attending a private clinic in Lima, Peru. Participants had undergone complex techniques of assisted fertilization (FIV and ICSI). The verbal Gottschalk analytical method was used to identify predominant anxiety manifestations in the interviews. RESULTS The most common types of anxiety associated with embryo donation for research in this group of participants were guilt, separation anxiety and shame. Divided by gender, the more common types of anxiety reported by men were guilt, shame and separation anxiety. Women reported guilt, separation anxiety and shame.</dc:description>
