<dc:description xml:lang="en">Five week old chickens have been fed a diet of 30% lentils. The animals showed an 80% growth decrease and a higher excitability level in relation to the control group. The animals were slaughtered after the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th week of age. The gall-bladder showed a 20% size increase in the 4th week. The relation pancreas weight/body weight is significant with the highest proportion at 34% in the 4th week. No important differences have been observed in D.N.A. content in pancreatic tissue between animals fed the lentils diet and the control group. The enzimatic activity has been analyzed. The proteolytic activity varies significantly, being 22% higher in the lentils group in the 3rd week, and 30% in the 4th week. The amylasic activity showed significant statistical differences, being 23% higher in the 5th week.</dc:description>
