<dc:description xml:lang="en">Parathyroid cysts are rare in clinical practice, but, when they appear, they can be mistaken for more common thyroid conditions, that can incidentally be associated with them. We present two cases of parathyroid cysts. One of them was misdiagnosed of thyroid nodule and the other was found in the context of a normo-functioning multinodular goitre. In this last case, the presenting symptoms had raised the suspicion of malignancy. Both of them responded favorably to evacuation of the liquid by means of a puncture-aspiration with a fine needle (PAFN). Our clinical cases show that the diagnosis of parathyroid cyst should be considered in patients with a cervical mass, even if an evident thyroid condition is present. They may be accurately diagnosed by means of PAFN and determining PTH in the cystic liquid, whose characteristics help to predict its side of origin.</dc:description>
