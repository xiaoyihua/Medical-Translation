<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Antibiotic allergy questionnaire is a useful tool for prescribing antibiotics. The objective of this study is to assess the prevalence and clinical reliability of antibiotic allergy in medical records. PATIENTS AND METHOD Observational analysis of clinical records. Assessment of antibiotic allergy by direct interview conducted by the investigator. RESULTS 610 medical records were evaluated. Antibiotic allergy was checked in 98%, mainly in medical wards. In 12 % of patients, antibiotic allergy was suspected, but after investigator interview only 5% of patients fulfilled clinical criteria for allergy. 44% of falses allergies were recorded. The most frequent cause of confusion was faint and gastric intolerance. CONCLUSIONS The questionnaire about antibiotic allergy is present in almost all medical records. However its reliability is low, less than 50%. Prevalence of veritable antibiotic allergy is 5% in this study. Antibiotic allergy questionnaire in medical records is a practical tool. However periodical training about antibiotic allergy definition is necessary for nurses and medical staff.</dc:description>
