<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to describe 5 microepidemics of tuberculosis occurring in schools, establish the risk factors associated with the outbreaks, assess how well a concentric circles strategy for contact tracing predicts infection, and assess the usefulness of genotyping strains in the analysis of the outbreaks. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study assessed 5 epidemic outbreaks of tuberculosis using a standard contact tracing procedure. The outbreaks occurred in 2 day nurseries and 2 high schools between 1998 and 2005. Contacts were stratified using a concentric circle system based on level of exposure. DNA fingerprints of the available strains were determined based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) IS6110 and compared with the contact study to interpret the transmission of the infection. RESULTS We analyzed 5 outbreaks. Eighty-five contacts were analyzed in the first outbreak, 519 in the second, 116 in the third, 655 in the fourth, and 102 in the fifth. The rate of infection was 31%, 29%, 66%, 37.6%, and 32%, respectively. Secondary cases of active disease were detected: 9 in the first outbreak, 16 in the second, 5 in the third, 6 in the fourth, and 13 in the fifth. RFLP analysis revealed that a single strain was involved in 3 of the outbreaks, and in a fourth, at least 2 strains were involved. In outbreaks 2, 3, and 5, there was a significant association between the degree of contact and the probability of infection (P&lt; .05). In all of the outbreaks, the relative risk of developing the disease was associated with the level of exposure. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of contacts based on concentric circles of risk predicts the likelihood of infection. RFLP facilitates analysis of complex transmission routes that are not detected using traditional methods of contact screening.</dc:description>
