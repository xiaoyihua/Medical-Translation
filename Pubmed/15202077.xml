<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Paediatric neurology (PN) remains 'hidden' somewhere between paediatrics and neurology in almost all health care centres and this makes it difficult to allocate resources in a proper manner. AIMS Our objective in this study was to analyse PN health care activity and compare it with adult neurology (AN) and with non-neurological paediatrics (NNP). MATERIAL AND METHODS PN health care activity registry for the year 2002. AN and NNP data were collected from the hospital's Computer Service. RESULTS In all, 1300 PN visits were made, 428 of which were new and 872 successive, which represent 16.2% of paediatric visits (30% new, 13.3% successive) and 10.3% of neurological visits (12.4% new, 10.2% successive). The rates of new and successive visits in PN are: 32.6, 10.7 and 21.9 per 1000 children, and in AN: 44.2, 12.5 and 31.7 per 1000 adults. A total number of 94 hospitalised children were attended, 3.3% of all paediatric admissions and 9.2% of the total neurological attention in inpatients. The rates are 2.36 per 1000 children in PN and 3.9 per 1000 adults in AN. There is greater demand among smaller children. The most frequent pathologies are headaches in clinical visits and epilepsy in hospitalised patients. CONCLUSIONS PN is essentially a service used by outpatients. It accounts for a high percentage of hospital paediatric visits. The activity rates per 1000 children and per 1000 adults are similar. The increased birth rate raises PN activity to a level that is higher than would normally be desirable, due to the growth in the population.</dc:description>
