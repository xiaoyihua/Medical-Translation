<dc:description xml:lang="en">Use of detection tests for p24 HIV antigen (p24Ag) in blood banks in Argentina is recommended by the Argentinean Society of Hemotherapy and Immunohematology. In the blood bank of the National University of Cordoba (Argentina), the recent implementation of the p24Ag screening test has considerably increased the cost of the battery of screening tests and its use in all blood donations has not produced the benefits expected. A 4th generation EIA was evaluated for the screening of HIV in comparison with the currently used assays in the blood bank of National University of Cordoba (3rd generation EIA + p24Ag assay). For this comparison, 11 serum samples from subjects with early HIV infection (early seroconversion period) were tested, as well as 27 serum samples from asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects and other 39 from non-HIV infected subjects. The 3rd generation EIA and the 4th generation EIA showed the same sensitivity value (100%) but the specificity of the 3rd generation EIA was higher (97.5%) comparing with 4th generation (95.1%). Besides, the p24Ag test failed to detect 2 samples from subjects with early HIV infection. These results indicate a good performance of both 3rd and 4th generation assays for screening of HIV. However, due to the lowest cost of 4th generation EIA kit, it could replace the currently used assays for HIV screening in regional blood banks. This screening assay will lead to gain in effectiveness and reduced costs until the detection of HIV RNA can be implemented in blood banks.</dc:description>
