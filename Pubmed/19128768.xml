<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION A wide variety of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening criteria exists in the different hospitals. In 1988, the benefits of cryotherapy treatment in severe ROP cases were demonstrated, and since then, some scientific societies have made recommendations on the screening and treatment of ROP. Within the Spanish scientific community, there are no specific recommendations on screening, diagnosis or treatment. OBJECTIVES To describe the criteria used in the screening of retinopathy in premature newborns by those Spanish hospitals caring for babies with birth weights below 1,500 g. MATERIAL AND METHOD A cross-sectional study was performed based on a 50 question questionnaire on screening criteria and other related issues. This questionnaire was sent to those public and private neonatal units in Spain caring for babies with birth weights below 1,500 grams. The questionnaire was sent and returned between January 2002 and May 2003. RESULTS Units in all of the 17 autonomous communities and both autonomous cities in territorial Spain (Ceuta and Melilla) responded. There was a 90% response rate. All the participating hospitals perform ROP screening. Only 62.9% of the hospitals follow a written protocol on screening. A large majority of hospitals (79.8%) perform a retinal eye examination on all newborns below 1500 g at birth. Half of the hospitals included in the study, 51.6%, determine the cut-off point for performing the screening at 32 weeks of gestational age. Around 73% of the hospitals include the administering of oxygen supplements to premature babies as part of the criteria for screening, regardless of the babies' weight and gestational age. Weight, gestational age and oxygen are the only criteria used in 51% of the units. That all hospitals in Spain should establish some screening criteria was suggested by 90% of the responses. Only 10% use analgesia or sedation, other than topical, when examining the retina. CONCLUSIONS Even though all the hospitals participating in the study screen for ROP, there is little agreement on which criteria should be followed when screening and on other aspects related to its practice.</dc:description>
