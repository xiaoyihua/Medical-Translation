<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are now at the midterm of their target period, as 2015 is the date scheduled by the United Nations Organisation (UN) for their attainment. The purpose of this article is to review the current situation of the MDGs worldwide and to analyse the barriers which are preventing them from being attained in each of the MDG areas, as well as to assess a number of the indicators evaluated. In order to do so, a review has been made of the scientific literature published on the MDGs in the principal health sciences and social sciences databases, as well as the most significant reports on the issue drawn up by the United Nations. The scientific studies on the 8 MDGs and their 18 Targets make it possible to undertake a critical analysis of the situation in which each of these Goals are found at the present time, identifying the determinants that are preventing the attainment of the Goals and the actions considered necessary in order to achieve progress. Although there have been improvements in some of the goals on a world level, the research carried out to date reveals barriers to the attainment of the MDGs, as well as the insufficient weight of the developing countries in the economic and political decision-making processes, together with the incoherence between the economic policies and the social and health policies. Furthermore, Sub-Saharan Africa constitutes the most disadvantaged region, which means that it will not attain the majority of the MDGs. Spain and the developed countries, in addition to contributing resources, can also contribute to the MDGs by means of the identification and eradication of the barriers preventing attainment. This involves promoting international economic relations under conditions of social justice, by supporting a greater decision-making power for developing countries and denouncing actions that increase social inequalities and the impoverishment of the population.</dc:description>
