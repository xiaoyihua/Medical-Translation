<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To assess the influence of insertion/deletion polymorphism in the ACE gene on the microalbuminuria in essential hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS Seventy-nine patients with essential hypertension (37 males and 42 females) (mean age 39 [7] years, body mass index 28 [4] kg/m2), never treated with antihypertensive drugs were included in the study. Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was assessed in two different days. Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) was assessed during 24 h period. Genotype ACE gene and gene frequencies were determined by an assay based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS The distribution of phenotypes was: II = 14 (17%), ID = 32 (40%) and DD = 33 (43%). The mean for UAE tended to be higher in the DD group (53.82 [88.4] mg/24 h) than ID (27.8 [39.6] mg/24 h) and II (23.8 [16.7] mg/24 h). Likewise, the average for UAE were higher in the DD group than in the II + ID group (26.6 [34.0] mg/24 h) (p = 0.06), although the differences did not achieved statistical significance. The relationship between log UAE and 24-hour mean BP was significantly higher in the DD group (r2 = 0.232; p = 0.005) than that observed in the other groups (r2 = 0.060; p = 0.101). CONCLUSIONS In the present study with young patients with essential hypertension, in DD genotype, UAE seems to be higher and more dependent of BP levels than in the other hypertensives.</dc:description>
