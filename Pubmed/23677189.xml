<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Medical doctors need to be competent to teach patients, their families, students, and the health care team. In a previous study we determined that although the residents attach great importance to have teaching skills, they do not feel prepared to meet this role. AIM To assess self-perception of learning in a formal course of training how to teach for residents. MATERIAL AND METHODS In 2004 we implemented the course "Residents as Clinical Teachers", based on the Stanford Faculty Development Center for Medical Teachers Model (SFDC), for residents of a Medical School. Residents of all the post graduate programs were invited to take the course as an elective during the period 2004-2011. At the end of the course each resident completed the pre/post Seminar Series Housestaff/student Questionnaire; assessing perceptions of learning, expressed in a Likert scale from 1-5. RESULTS The implementation of the course in 111 residents significantly improved self-perception of general preparation for teaching and improved self-perception of preparedness in each educational category. The personal goals most commonly established by participants were on feedback (52,2%), control of session (44%) and communication of goals (40%). Barriers for teaching most frequently identified were lack of time to do clinical teaching (51,3%) and environmental limitations (16,2%). The main impact of the course reported by residents were acquisition of teaching skills or tools for teaching (39,6%), enhancing of motivation (14%), and a richer understanding of teaching principles (14%). CONCLUSIONS A clinical teaching course for residents improves their self-perception of preparation to teach and enhances motivation for clinical teaching.</dc:description>
