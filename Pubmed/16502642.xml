<dc:description xml:lang="en">Bush like vegetation dominates arid environments, and there is nutrients accumulation under shrub canopies and relatively unfertile soils between vegetal patches areas. Plants are one of the most common habitats for yeasts. There are many reports about yeasts inhabiting different plant components. Nevertheless, there are no reports about yeasts associated with Zygophyllaceae, an important shrub family of the Argentinean Province of Monte. The objective of this work was to analyzed yeast biodiversity of Bulnesia retama and Larrea divaricata canopies and associated soils, at Medanos Grandes of Caucete, San Juan, Argentina. Eighty seven (87) isolated yeasts were identified. From B. retama canopy and associated soil was observed a larger taxonomical diversity respect to L. divaricata. Nine (9) and ten (10) species were isolated from canopy and associated soil of B. retama, respectively. From L. divaricata canopy were 4 species and 3 species from its associated soil isolated. Identified genera were: Candida, Debaryomyces, Dekkera, Saccharomyces, Torulaspora, Sporidiobolus and Pichia. Fourteen (14) species were found at all microenvironments.</dc:description>
