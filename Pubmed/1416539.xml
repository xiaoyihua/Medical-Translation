<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two hundred and sixty-two newborn infants, born to mothers with a positive syphilis serology, have been studied. Twenty-six newborn infants had congenital syphilis and two hundred and thirty-six were considered as newborn infants from syphilitic mothers. This study has demonstrated that the newborn infants with congenital syphilis have been born to mothers with greatest risk factors. Newborn infants with congenital syphilis born to mothers on treatment during the pregnancy had a milder case of congenital syphilis than newborn infants born to mothers without treatment during the pregnancy. A diagnostic test for the treatment in these newborns has been proposed; if the test score is less than 5, we are dealing with a child of a syphilitic mother that does not need treatment and if the test results are higher than 5 we can confirm the diagnosis of congenital syphilis and immediate treatment must be started.</dc:description>
