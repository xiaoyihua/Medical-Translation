<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Biliary atresia presents a worldwide incidence about 1 of every 9000-12000 live newborns. Our goal was to analyze the prognostic variables of our patients with biliary atresia. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective study, based on the review of all patients who underwent surgery at our centre by the Kasai technique from March 1983 to January 2012. A total of 52 variables were analyzed such as: clinical history, symptoms, diagnostic tests, use of corticosteroids, complications and evolution. RESULTS From 35 patients operated by Kasai Technical we included 29, being 58.82% male; grouped according to the age of surgery: Group A (&lt; 60 days) 14/29; Group B (60-90) 14/29 and Group C (&gt; 90) 1/29. We observed that atresia type II was more common in the Group A and III in group B and C. There was a predominance of hepatic fibrosis in patients from Group A and C, and cirrhosis in B. The mean hospital stay was 24.66; 28.50 and 50.00 days for Group A, B and C respectively. Since 2004 it is established a treatment with corticosteroids in the postoperative period; complications noted in 40% of the treated and in 70% of the untreated. In 10 years, 44.82% are asymptomatic and transplanted 37.9%. CONCLUSIONS In this study both the diagnosis and early Kasai technique improve prognosis. Treatment with corticoids could benefit short-term results.</dc:description>
