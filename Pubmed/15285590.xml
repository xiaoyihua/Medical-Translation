<dc:description xml:lang="en">Gynaecomastia is more frequent during the adolescence. In this paper, a retrospective study of nine cases diagnosed and treated on a period of six years is presented. The reports of nine patients are reviewed. The mean age at diagnosis was 10.4 years (range 9-12). In all cases a bilateral mammary hypertrophy was detected, symmetrical in 6 cases (67%) and asymmetric in 3 (33%). After a mean follow-up period of 24 months, surgical treatment was indicated: a subtotal subcutaneous mastectomy was performed in all nine cases. Only two patients developed early complications: one wound infection and one haematoma. The long-term plastic results were satisfactory after a mean follow-up postoperative period of 11 months. The general management of this kind of pathologic process is presented. In the authors experience the elective surgical procedure is the subtotal subcutaneous mastectomy as simple procedure with a very short morbidity and excellent plastic results.</dc:description>
