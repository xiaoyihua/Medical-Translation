<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To find user satisfaction and preferences in the doctor-patient relationship and the clinical interview. DESIGN Observational, descriptive, crossover study. SETTING Community-based (city of Jaén). PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS 286 people over 18, randomised with quotas for age and gender. INTERVENTIONS Validated questionnaire including basic data, whether they are satisfied with their General Practitioner (GP) and 25 items to evaluate the importance of various aspects of the clinical interview and the doctor-patient relationship. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS 31% (SE, 2.7) of those surveyed were very satisfied with their GP; 37% (SE, 2.8) satisfied; and 4% (SE, 1.1) stated that their relationship was unsatisfactory. Satisfaction, the same as the remembering and carrying out of medical advice, is greater (p &lt; 0.01) in older patients, those with lower social and economic position, those registered at Health Centres and those who saw their GP recently. Those surveyed considered the most valued features of a visit to the doctor to be then items to do with the information provided by the doctor. CONCLUSIONS A high level of satisfaction with the GP was found, especially from patients registered at a Health Centre. Communication in the interview was highly valued. There was less value placed on features of the consultation which focused on the patient.</dc:description>
