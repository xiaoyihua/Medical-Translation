<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Identify the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of a sample of chemically dependent people undergoing treatment at a daytime ambulatory care center specialized in treating chemical dependency in Lima, Peru, and describe their dropout rates. METHOD Quantitative, descriptive, and exploratory study based on secondary data. The instrument used was the individual notification record from the information system for the treatment demand. RESULTS The demand was composed mostly of young, single men who were unemployed or underemployed. The most common diagnosis was dependency on cocaine-based drugs and the age of the onset of use was between 15 and 19 years. The dropout rate was 85%, and 48% remained in treatment for only one day. CONCLUSION The results highlight important factors to be considered in the evaluation of public policies on prevention, treatment, and supply control. We recommend more inclusive and participatory public policies.</dc:description>
