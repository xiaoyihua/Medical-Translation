<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to estimate the current prevalence of Chronic Renal Insufficiency (RI) in ambulatory patients with type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) assisted in Endocrinology Departments all over Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was an observational, cross sectional, multicenter study. From each participant the following data were retrospective collected: demographic, anthropometric, renal function, diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities and treatment. RI was defined by a glomerular filtration rate lower than 60ml/min/1.73m(2), using the shortened MDRD method. RESULTS 541 patients with T2DM were included, 53% were men, the mean age (DS) was 63 years old (7.9) and the HbA(1)c was 7.6 % (1.3). The prevalence (CI95%) of RI was 22.9% (19.4-26.7), higher than the previous estimate, witch was 5,7% (3.9-8.0, p&lt;0,0001). The associated risk factor for RI were age (OR 2.07; 95%CI: 1.47-2.91 per each ten year period of increase), female gender (OR 2.25; 95%CI: 1.36-3.71) and hyperuricemia (OR 3.15; 95% CI: 1.56-6.37). There were no differences in the metabolic control between patients with RI vs those without RI. CONCLUSIONS 22.9% of T2DM ambulatory patients followed by endocrinologist had RI, but just a quarter of them had previously been diagnosed. The automated determination of creatinine clearance could increase the proportion of diagnosis and facilitate the improvement of the metabolic control in these patients.</dc:description>
