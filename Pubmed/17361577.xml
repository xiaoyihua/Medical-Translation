<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of some experiences emphasising physical activity in promoting health in Bogotá. METHODS A documentary review of theoretical models of intervention was first undertaken, followed by examining guidelines proposed in international declarations and in Bogotá related to physical activity. Three-phase analysis was carried. 1) The exploratory phase involved collecting general information regarding programmes pertaining to physical activity aimed at preventing non-transmittable chronic diseases (NTCD) and promoting health. 2) The descriptive phase involved characterising programmes for promoting physical activity according to their objectives, scope and the strategies and methodologies used in such processes. 3) The analytical phase involved a critical analysis of current programmes in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. RESULTS The programmes analysed here promoted self-management and autonomy by producing support networks and training leaders for guaranteeing their sustainability. CONCLUSIONS The programmes involved people and the community by holding practical and theoretical workshops which did not cover the whole vital human process, but concentrated on specific population groups. They were deficient in broadcasting in the mass-media.</dc:description>
