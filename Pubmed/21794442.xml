<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To know the perception of Spanish rheumatologists of the profile of the patient with ankylosing spondyloarthritis, candidate for biological therapy treatment. To determine what proportion of patients with ankylosing spondylitis is considered a candidate for this therapy and to know up to what point this decision agrees with the recommendations of the ASAS working group on anti-TNF therapies and with the consensus of the SER METHOD: Rheumatologists from 19 Spanish centers who are experts in treating patients with AS and in the use of anti-TNF drugs participated in this study but they were not aware of the recommendations of the ASAS group and of the SER (unpublished until this work). RESULTS One hundred and eighty five patients were included in the study. Spanish rheumatologists indicated that they would start therapy with anti-TNF drugs in altogether 37.8% of the patients. The candidates had the highest values of disease activity, of acute-phase reactants, the worst spinal mobility, worst function, more hip damage, and high sick leave prevalence. Out of the total of the patients considered as candidates for treatment with biological therapies by their rheumatologists, 45.7% did not comply with the ASAS recommendations with respect to prior treatments with NSAIDs and BASDAI and 48.6% did not comply with the SER criteria; 29.1% of the patients who did not comply with the ASAS criteria (NSAIDs-BASDAI) were considered to be candidates for treatment with anti-TNF drugs; 29.6% of the patients who did not comply with the SER criteria were also considered to be candidates. The most important criterion was the clinical activity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS The agreement between the criteria applied by the Spanish rheumatologist and proposed by ASAS working group and the SER consensus is low. Axial affectation, activity, and severity in their disease were the criteria used but frequently by the Spanish rheumatologist to indicate biological therapy in patients with AS.</dc:description>
