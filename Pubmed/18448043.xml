<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the needs of elderly individuals living alone and with some degree of dependency for activities of daily live. METHOD We performed a cross-sectional descriptive study in an urban health center (San Andrés-Torcal in Málaga, Spain). Persons aged more than 65 years old who lived alone and had some degree of dependency were studied. RESULTS The sample was composed of 64 elderly individuals, 58 women and 6 men. The mean age was 83.3 years (SD 4.13). Sixteen people (25%) were independent for daily living when aided by others, while 48 (75%) had one or more needs that were not covered. The most frequent nursing diagnoses were: impaired physical mobility in 58, risk of falls in 54, diversional activity deficit in 48, impaired urinary elimination in 38, and social isolation or deterioration in social interaction in 36. Fifty-six individuals had family. Half had no contact with neighbors, 12 (18.8%), did not receive visits, and 26 (40.6%) had nobody to whom they could tell their problems. Architectonic barriers to the house were identified in 48 individuals and access barriers to the home were found in 29. The total sample received a pension of between 301 and 600 euros. CONCLUSIONS The persons evaluated showed numerous areas of dependency and there was a high proportion whose basic needs were not suitably covered. Because of the multiple and distinct problems identified, we believe that active screening should be performed in this vulnerable population. In addition, special attention should be paid to these individuals and the required help should be offered so that they have information and access to the available health and social resources.</dc:description>
