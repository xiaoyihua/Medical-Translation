<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the past decade, notable advances have been made with regard to understanding the clinical, biological and epidermological aspects of the basic disorders of development (TPD), particularly autism. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the neurobiological basis is still limited. This has impeded the development of drugs which correct the defect and cure the illness. Although there is no perfect drug, in recent years clinico-pharmacological research has made it possible to use drugs which have been very helpful in correcting the symptoms associated with these disorders. These drugs have permitted a better therapeutic approach and improved family and social integration of these children (in the family and in society). We will proceed to analyze some of the drugs shown to be useful for treatment of children with TPD.</dc:description>
