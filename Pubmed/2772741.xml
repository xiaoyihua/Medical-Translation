<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Master's degree program of the Escuela de Salud Pública de México (ESPM) has undergone a continuous process of evaluation and re-design since January 1988. An analysis of the program for 1985 showed problems of organization, sequence and integration of the curricular contents, as well as lack coherence with the stated objectives of the program and with the desired profile of the public health professional. Attention to environmental and population problems was almost absent. The Division of Academic Programs was created, and with the active participation of the academic staff a new design was developed, which resulted in the program to be applied in 1989. The next phase in this continuous process of evaluation and updating consists of the project Prospective Planning for Public Health Education in the Year 2005.</dc:description>
