<dc:description xml:lang="en">The frequency, morbidity and complexity of neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) make them the greatest therapeutic challenge to Medicine today. These diseases are characterized by a decreased number of cells in certain neuronal populations, which is clinically reflected in the appearance of specific symptoms. In this study, we will centre our attention on the two fundamental lines of action that, from a pharmacological point of view, are available for the treatment of NDD. The first is aetiopathogenic, and is aimed at stopping cell death and promoting the recovery of cell populations. The second line is physiopathological and seeks to prevent, delay or palliate the appearance of the symptoms indicating an alteration in the levels of neurotransmitters, and its chief objective is to maintain them. Pharmacology has already provided neurologists with a wide range of tried and tested drugs, yet the results obtained in research laboratories in the last few years seem to indicate that the number of therapeutic possibilities are very likely to rise sharply in the future. Progress made in genomics and the better understanding of cellular biochemical cycles allow us to expect that this century will finally be that of the Neurosciences, and that Neurology, without losing its cognitive essence, will start to be considered to be a speciality that is as therapeutic as it is diagnostic.</dc:description>
