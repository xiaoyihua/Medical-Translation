<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report one case of discontinuous splenogonadal fusion, an rarely referred entity, with clinical interest, without important repercussions in most cases. METHODS 23-year-old male with the diagnosis of right paratesticular mass, with negative markers for germ cell tumors. On ultrasound the mass was homogeneous and isoechoic in comparison with the adjacent testicular parenchyma. On surgical exploration, the mass was excised, with the pathologic result of splenogonadal fusion, with normal splenic tissue. RESULTS Being maybe more frequent in pediatric surgery and urology practices, splenogonadal fusion presents two differentiated forms: continuous with a fibrous or nodular cord from the spleen to the gonad, retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal; and discontinuous in which there is no topographic communication between spleen and ectopic splenic tissue adjacent to the testicle. CONCLUSIONS Although they are exceptional, splenic remainders fused to the testicle, epididymis or vas deferens may present the differential diagnosis with testicular and paratesticular masses.</dc:description>
