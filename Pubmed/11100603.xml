<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To study the attitude of primary care doctors when a high (&gt; or = 4 ng/ml) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is found and to examine the variables linked to a prostate biopsy and the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PC). DESIGN Descriptive, observational study. SETTING Urban health district. PATIENTS Ninety-four men not previously diagnosed with PC who in 1998 had a PSA figure &gt; or = 4 ng/ml. The list was obtained from the pertinent laboratory. MEASUREMENTS The following variables were gathered from review of clinical records: family background of PC, age, PSA figure, reason for request for PSA (if not given, it was considered a screening), referral to the urologist, rectal touch, transrectal echography, prostate biopsy and final diagnosis. RESULTS Average age was 70 (SD, 9.31). The reason for requesting PSA was: urine symptoms in 25 (26.6%), other signs or symptoms in 25 (26.6%), request of patient in 2 cases (2.1%) and screening in 42 (44.7%). Rectal touch took place in 16 cases. Twenty-nine people were referred for examination to the urologist. 36 patients had an echography and biopsy. Variables linked to the prostate biopsy in the logistic model were: higher value of the PSA (OR 1.1; 95% CI, 1.03-1.18), being older (OR 0.92; CI, 0.87-0.98) and rectal touch performed (OR 3.58; CI, 1.02-12.51). Ten cases of PC were diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS The most common reason for a PSA request was screening. Prostate biopsy was not requested for 58 men. A primary care guide to action concerning PC diagnosis in cases of PSA &gt; or = 4 ng/ml would be useful.</dc:description>
