<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The determination techniques of chorionic gonadotropin and transvaginal high resolution ultrasound have revolutionized the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. OBJECTIVE Assess demographic aspects associated with ectopic pregnancy in Hospital Angeles del Pedregal over a 6 years period. MATERIALS AND METHODS Descriptive and retrospective study. We reviewed 143 clinical records from March 1, 2006 to January 31, 2013, with diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy discharge. The analyzed variables were: age, history of ectopic pregnancy, method of family planning, pelvic inflammatory disease, smoking, weeks of gestation, clinical picture, localization of ectopic pregnancy, treatment and complications. RESULTS Were analyzed 143 cases, diagnosed and corroborated with histopathological study, of ectopic pregnancy in Hospital Angeles del Pedregal during the period from 2006 to 2012. The average age at which pregnancies occurred was 32.4 +/- 5.4 years; 89% of patients were over 25 years old. 35% were primigravidous and 51 women had previous caesarean, 31 abortion and 22 childbirth. 10% had history of ectopic pregnancy and 39% had 5 weeks gestation; 72% not used contraceptives, 30% were smokers, and only 2% had suffered pelvic inflammatory disease. CONCLUSION Despite the technological advances the correct evaluation of risk factors is essential for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.</dc:description>
