<dc:description xml:lang="en">Agenesia of the Müllerian ducts is a low-frequency congenital disease but with devastating effects on women's reproductive health. In this paper we present two cases of women affected by Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH). First case was a 17-year-old woman with aplasia of the upper vagina and absence of uterus. No other defects were found and was classified as type 1-MRKH. Second case was 18-year-old woman with absence of uterus, escoliosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, classified as type II-MRKH. Patients were seen at the Hospital with primary amenorrhea and fully developed secondary sexual characteristics. A clinical follow-up protocol, including the use of high-resolution image studies was used for diagnosis. Diagnostic procedures and current medical approaches to the treatment of MRKH are discussed, including psychological advisory, surgical procedures and new tissue-engineering techniques.</dc:description>
