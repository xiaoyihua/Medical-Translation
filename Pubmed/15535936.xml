<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The relationship between peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection was studied by analyzing clinical samples from 95 patients with PAOD (cases) and 100 controls. PATIENTS AND METHOD The following investigations were conducted: IgG and IgA against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and against purified C. pneumoniae-specific antigens from elementary bodies (EB) with ELISA; anti-EB IgG, with MIF; C. pneumoniae DNA in arterial biopsy and peripheral blood leukocyte cells (PBLCs) with heminested PCR; LPS with ELISA; and bacteria culture in HEp-2 cells from arterial biopsy. RESULTS The percentage of positive results in cases and controls groups for anti-LPS IgG was: 21% and 14%, respectively, with no differences; nor were there any differences with IgA (22 and 21%, respectively). However, differences were seen in the anti-EB IgG between cases (74% and 72%, for ELISA and MIF, respectively) and controls (31% and 34%). There were no differences in anti-EB IgA. Bacterial DNA was detected in 67% of atheromatous plaques (cases) vs. 12% of pudendal arteries (controls) (p = 0.0001). No C. pneumoniae DNA and LPS was detected in PBLCs and biopsic samples, respectively; and no C. pneumoniae strain could be recovered by cell culture from cases. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of our results, PAOD is significantly associated with C. pneumoniae infection through the detection of anti-EB IgG from serum and bacterial DNA from arterial biopsy.</dc:description>
