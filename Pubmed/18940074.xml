<dc:description xml:lang="en">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) usually presents a profile in which the freedom from distraction factor of the WISC-R (FDF) is affected to a greater extent than the verbal comprehension factor (VCF) and the perceptual organisation factor (POF). The formulation FDF&lt; (VCF + POF)/2 has good sensitivity for ADHD. The aim of this study was to reduce the number of tests needed for the formulation FDF&lt; (VCF + POF)/2, maintaining the sensitivity for ADHD and concordance with the complete formulation. A clinical sample of 167 children with ADHD is analysed (6-16 years). The cases of ADHD were defined according to DSM-IV criteria and they were assessed with WISC-R, Child Symptom Inventory and Social and Occupational Activity Assessment Scale. Lineal regression method was used to reduce the number of tests. The results showed that the short formulation reduces the number of tests by half and it has 83% sensitivity for ADHD. This formulation presents a good concordance with the complete version. The FDF is significantly lower than the VCF, POF and intellectual quotient in cases of ADHD. Comorbidity, social or school activity do not have a significant influence on the probability that FDF&lt; (VCF + POF)/2.</dc:description>
