<dc:description xml:lang="en">We suggest a technique in which the rules of the Gnatology are strictly followed and an organic occlusion is entirely made of metal, it is checked its function, appropriate alignment, phonation, aesthetics, gingival adaptation, contact, relations, etc., as if it were a final rehabilitation. Then, on the original model, each crown, future ceramic carrier, is made and the necessary space for the porcelain and its adaptation is tested into the mouth. In the same way, the following steps are carried out till the biscuit and all the relations with the elements, that are to be imitated, are strictly established, when the biscuit has been finished, the whole is tested into the mouth. Finally, the crowns and bridges are made up and shade but this will not alter the function that has been obtained, due to the meticulous technique that has been suggested.</dc:description>
