<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Describing socio-demographic characteristics in a population of 195 respiratory symptomatic and 18 tuberculosis patients from Calarcá-Quindío, Colombia during 2005. METHODS An active search for individuals having symptomatic tuberculosis was carried out in three urban areas, Calarca's municipal prison and the San Juan de Dios teaching hospital. Prior to entering the study, the patients were required to fill out an application form and sign an informed consent form. Sputum samples were taken from each patient for bacilloscopy and culture in Ogawa-Kudoh medium. Phenotypic and genotypic identification were made when growth was observed by using conventional and molecular methods. RESULTS 18 (9 ,2 %) out of 195 individuals having respiratory symptoms were diagnosed as having tuberculosis. 78 % were male and 22 % female; the average age was 40 for both genders. 174 sputum, 21 bronchial lavage, one urine, one cervical ganglia and pleural liquid sample were analysed; 77 % proved positive by direct smear test and culture, 16,7 % by culture and only 5,5 % by direct smear test. Bacilloscopy average per patient was 2 ,3 . The presence of H1, T1, H3 and LAM9 genotypes was demonstrated by using the spoligotyping test. CONCLUSIONS The results confirmed the importance of using both direct smear test and/or culture for improving the early detection of pulmonary tuberculosis, its follow-up and control. The existence of four different Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes in Calarcá was established .</dc:description>
