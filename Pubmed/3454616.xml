<dc:description xml:lang="en">The vegetative part of the amaranth plant could be a useful resource for animal feeding due to its chemical characteristics and to the high yield obtained when harvested between 45 and 60 days after planting. Six diets were evaluated in order to determine the feed efficiency of amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus) for growing rabbits. The diets contained dehydrated amaranth leaves and stalks in levels of 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60%, to replace equal amounts of alfalfa leaf meal. An additional diet containing 60% of steam-treated leaves and stalks of amaranth, for five minutes, prior to dehydration and milling, was also tested. The amaranth leaf meal contained 17.8% protein and 12.4% crude fiber as compared with the alfalfa leaf meal which contained 22.0% protein and 23.3% crude fiber. In terms of weight gain, feed intake, feed efficiency, carcass weight and serum proteins, the results indicated that amaranth leaf meal can efficiently replace alfalfa leaf meal up to 15% of the total weight of the diet. Higher levels, however, caused growth retardation and a pathological picture characterized by interstitial nephrosis and edema, more easily observed at a 60% level in the diet. Results also revealed that a steam treatment improves the nutritive quality of the amaranth meal.</dc:description>
