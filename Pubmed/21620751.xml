<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To measure the overall satisfaction of obstetrics patients with epidural analgesia during labour, and in particular, with the technique and other subjective factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS An anonymous questionnaire was administered over a three-month period to patients who received analgesia to control pain during labour and who had vaginal delivery, in order to obtain information of the satisfaction with technique and their care. RESULTS Of the 100 patients who responded to the questionnaire, 92% were satisfied with the technique. The mild satisfaction measured by SERVQHOS score was 3.98 (SD ± 0.64). The score for the subjective aspects was 4.10 (± 0.68), which was better than objective ones. The recommendation rate was 98% for satisfied patients and 85.7% for those who were not satisfied. There were no differences between Spanish and foreign patients in their evaluation of the satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS The proportion of patients satisfied with the technique was very high, and was the top rated subjective aspect (treatment and public confidence).</dc:description>
