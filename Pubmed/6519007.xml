<dc:description xml:lang="en">This article presents a study done to develop a professional profile of the physician based on the criteria of the medical faculty of the School of Medicine of Concepción University, Chile. It describes the methodology applied in the study and the results obtained organized under five heads: the personal qualities of the physician, professional ethics, professional competence, professional improvement, and the administrative aspects of the physician's work. The article stresses that constructing a professional profile is the most efficient way to organize the entire process of professional training and curriculum evaluation and that, therefore, every university should devise and continually revise the profiles of the professions in which it offers training.</dc:description>
