<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Steris system for cold sterilization with peracetic acid was evaluated by effecting a series of contaminations of a fiberoptic bronchoscope (FB) with specimens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii and Mycobacterium kansasi. The FB was contaminated 24 times, 8 times by each microorganism, using specimens containing more than 10(8) cfu/ml. After fixing the secretions on the FB and washing it with enzyme soap, the BF was sterilized. Specimens were taken for culturing after contamination of the FB, after washing, immediately after sterilization and 1 hour after sterilization. No microorganism growth of any of the samples was detected either immediately after sterilization or one hour later. Microbiological data confirmed contamination of the FB after aspiration and fixation of the inoculate. Chemical and biological tests with B. stearothermophilus spores as specified by the manufacturer were correct in all cases: 24 contaminations and 52 processes of prior training. The efficacy of washing with enzyme soap before sterilization stands out. In 14 of the 24 samples, culture was negative after washing and in 7 the concentration of microorganisms was less than 500 cfu/ml, which confirms the need for appropriate washing before any disinfection or sterilization process is begun. In conclusion, the Steris system based on peracetic acid is an alternative to other systems for cold sterilization or high level disinfection.</dc:description>
