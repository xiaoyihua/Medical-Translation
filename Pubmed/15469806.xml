<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To present the change in infant mortality (IM) in Chile and its possible explanations. METHODS We performed a time-series study. Data on infant mortality were gathered from the demographic yearbooks of the National Institute of Statistics and from the health programs implemented by the Ministry of Health. RESULTS The IM rate fell from 16 per 1000 live newborns in 1990 to 8.3 per 1000 in 2001. Programs for the use of surfactant and for the surgical management of cardiac malformations in newborns were implemented. Programs for the early treatment of acute respiratory infection were also implemented and new vaccines were introduced into the National Immunization Program in infants. CONCLUSIONS The fall in infant mortality in Chile between 1990 and 2001 may be partly due to the implementation of the above-mentioned programs.</dc:description>
