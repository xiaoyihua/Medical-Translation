<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To determine the knowledge and management of vitamin D (Vit D) in primary care (PC). DESIGN Observational study. LOCATION A total of 69 primary care centres, with 57 in Barcelona and 12 in Huesca. PARTICIPANTS All medical and nursing graduates of these centres. MAIN MEASUREMENTS A specifically designed questionnaire was used to collect knowledge on the actions of Vit D (on bone metabolism, cardiovascular and immune systems), its deficiency and prevention measures. RESULTS Of the total of 2100 professionals, 785 completed the survey (37.78%), of whom 79.9% were women. Their mean age was 47 years (SD: 9.7). Only 4.8% knew the overall actions of Vitamin D, although the majority (66%) knew only its effects on bone metabolism. Almost two-thirds (62.4%) were unaware that its deficiency was a common problem, and 54.9% believed that photoprotection was contraindicated. Almost three-quarters of those surveyed (73.6%) never or almost never determined Vit D levels in their patients. A minority (23%) offered advice to maintain an adequate level of Vit D, with the most frequent being sun exposure (16.8%). Pediatricians were more knowledgeable (p&lt;.001) and offered more advice for maintaining adequate levels of Vit D in blood (p&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS Most of the professionals were unaware of the overall actions of Vit D, or that its deficiency was common, or the factors contributing to this. The advice that was more often offered to avoid its deficiency was not the safest. Paediatricians are more aware of how to prevent Vit D deficiency.</dc:description>
