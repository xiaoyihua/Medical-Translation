<dc:description xml:lang="en">To evaluate serum vitamin levels and its association with obstetrics and perinatal results in HIV infected pregnant women. Observational and prospective study carried out at Division of Infectious-Contagious Diseases in Gynecology and Obstetrics of the University Hospital, Medicine School of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo, involving 57 pregnant women divided into 3 groups: Group 1, with 12 normal pregnant women, it was the control group; Group 2, with 20 HIV infected pregnant women, using ZDV; and Group 3, with 25 HIV infected pregnant women, using therapy I contend ZDV, 3TC and nelfinavir. The evaluation of the serum vitamin level was obtained three times during pregnancy at equidistant time intervals and in the immediate period after birth. We also evaluated the levels of this vitamin and the hemoglobin in the blood of the umbilical cord. We obtained maternal and newborn infant anthropometric data, as well as the counting of lymphocyte TCD4 and viral load of the HIV during the pregnancy. Reduced serum vitamin levels were observed in the Group 1(25%), the Group 2(29,4%) and the Group 3(28,6%). Association was not observed between serum levels of maternal retinol and the duration of the gestation in groups 2 and 3. In groups 1 and 3, an association was observed between the maternal concentration of retinol and the newborn hemoglobin (p=0.05). In distinct way to the Control group, association was not observed between the retinol levels of the umbilical cord and the weight of the newborn in gestations of Group 2, while a trend to this association was observed in gestations of Group 3 (p=0.06). We observed high prevalence of hipovitaminosis A in the population of this study, regardless of antiretroviral scheme used.</dc:description>
