<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Histoplasma capsulatum infection in a group of volunteers who had traveled to Guatemala. METHODS A review was performed of the clinical records of nine patients who consulted at the Tropical Medicine Outpatient Unit of Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, Spain. RESULTS. All patients were attended for travelers' diarrhea. In addition, one student had also presented with respiratory symptoms and fever while in Guatemala and her chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltrates. The epidemiological history recognized risk factors for histoplasmosis in all patients (all of them had been working in the reconstruction of an old school building). The intradermal histoplasmin test was performed and was positive in all nine patients. None of the students required treatment. CONCLUSIONS Histoplasmosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of returning travelers' fever. The diagnosis would have been missed in all of our patients if not for a directed clinical history taking. It is important to reinforce prevention measures, e.g. the use of face masks, when working in an environment with a risk for acquiring histoplasmosis.</dc:description>
