<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis with dexamethasone may produce significant hyperglycemia in the postoperative period. AIM To evaluate if this effect is of greater severity in type 2 diabetics compared with non-diabetic patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty non-diabetic and thirty type 2 diabetic patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were studied in a prospective and double-blind fashion manner. Patients were randomly distributed into 4 groups: Group I, non-diabetics control (n = 20), Group II, non-diabetics dexamethasone (n = 20), Group III, type 2 diabetics control (n = 15), and Group IV, type 2 diabetics dexamethasone (n = 15). Immediately after induction, patients in groups I and III received isotonic saline and patients in the dexamethasone groups received 8 mg i.v. of the steroid. Capillary blood glucose concentrations were measured at baseline and every 2 hours during the first 12 hours since the start of surgery. A linear mixed effect model, adjusted for baseline capillary glucose concentration, age and duration of surgery was used to analyze the data. RESULTS No effect of the presence of diabetes mellitus was observed in the evolution of glucose concentrations. There was a difference in capillary glucose concentrations between patients who received dexamethasone and placebo that started 2 hours post-intervention, reaching a mean maximum difference of 34 mg/dl (adjusted model, p &lt; 0.001) at 10 hours post-intervention. CONCLUSIONS In this study, Type 2 diabetic patients did not show a higher susceptibility than non-diabetics to develop postoperative hyperglycemia after the use of prophylactic dexamethasone for PONV.</dc:description>
