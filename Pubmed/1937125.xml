<dc:description xml:lang="en">A simple open study was undertaken in order to assess the value of the dopamine-agonist lisuride in the treatment of patients with two types of hyperprolactinemia: Six patients with pituitary adenoma and two with "idiopathic hyperprolactinemia". All patients were started on a dose of 0.2 mg per os per day until values of serum prolactin became normal (two to eleven months in the first group), except for two that required increment to 0.4 mg/day after the first four months without effect; both responded satisfactorily to the increased dose. Side effects were mild nausea end occasional vomiting, except in one case of the first group, which abandoned the treatment due to intense vomiting. One of the patients of "idiopathic hyperprolactinemia" required the dose to be increased to 0.4 mg/day after the first four months and finally responded after two more months with the higher dose. The second patient of this group did not respond even to a dose of 1 mg/day, which was otherwise well tolerated.</dc:description>
