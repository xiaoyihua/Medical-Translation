<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Appraisal of the process of assistance is a fundamental step in determination of the quality of medical assistance given. DEVELOPMENT AND CONCLUSIONS In this paper we review the concept of medical assistance as a product, establishing a parallel between medical assistance and a process of industrial production. We consider the similarities and differences between them. From the point of view of production management we may distinguish different elements: the setting, structure, process of production, result and evaluation. All these are also found in healthcare assistance. We review the concept of the process of assistance both from the limited point of view of the management of disease and its complications, and from a broader perspective which includes the activities of patients in seeking and obtaining assistance. Different aspects and methods of appraisal of the process of assistance are considered: medical audit and monitoring. Finally, we approach the problem of appraisal of the process in outpatient assistance, the importance of this and the methods used in evaluation. We comment on experience of this aspect obtained in the Neurology Unit of the Hospital Marina Alta in Denia.</dc:description>
