<dc:description xml:lang="en">A review of maternal and perinatal results of multiparous patients with breech presentation was done during two period; two years before and two years after establishing the rule of cesarean section for all multi-parous with breech presentation. Seventy cases were considered at the first period in which 47.1% were vaginal delivery, proportion that significantly decreased (15%) at the second period. No significant differences on maternal results by delivery form were found and the same was found in perinatal results at comparing vaginal delivery and cesarean section. A different situation was reported studying only elective cesarean section, in which a significant decrease of severe neonatal depression was found comparing to vaginal delivery (24.2% and 0%). Because of rapid recovery there were no differences at fifth minute. As a conclusion, it appears as an exaggeration the option of cesarean section for all multiparous with breech presentation. Secondly, the adequate selection of cases to resolve by vaginal delivery may not produce adverse maternal and perinatal results.</dc:description>
