<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The prevalence of colorectal polyps in the general population is 10%. Hormonal alterations in acromegaly stimulates adenomatose polyps development making that increase it prevalence. Colonoscopy has elevated sensibility and specificity in detection of colorectal adenomas. OBJECTIVE Identify colonic polyps in patients with acromegaly and establish the importance of colonoscopy as a detection method. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective, observational and descriptive study made in Colon and Rectum Surgery Department from March 2000 to March 2007 in patients with acromegaly and colonoscopy. Analyzed variables were: gender,age, endoscopy findings and histopathological results. Descriptive statistics were used to analysis of results. RESULTS Thirty-two patients were included: 14 (44%) men, 18 (56%) women. The mean age was 48 (range 22 to 75 years old). In 9 (28%) patients were detected colorectal polyps, predominately in the sigmoid. Fifteen polyps lesion were found: 7 (46.6%) adenomas: 5 (33.3%) tubular and 2 (13.3) villous, 6 (40%) hyperplasic, 1 (6.6%) inflammatory and 1 (6.6%) carcinoma. Colonoscopy was complete in 30 (93.7%) patients. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of colonic polyps inpatients with acromegaly undergoing colonoscopy,was 28%, higher than expected in the general population. Colonoscopy constitutes an important diagnosis technique in early neoplasia detection.</dc:description>
