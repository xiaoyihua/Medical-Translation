<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The prognosis of rhabdomyolysis is conditioned by the development of acute renal failure which depends of quick preventive measures. Rhabdomyolysis is diagnosed by measuring plasma creatinkinase and it is usually suspected by the presence of previous putative causal factors like traumatisms. Non traumatic rhabdomyolysis usually lacks of clinical relevant antecedents and the syndrome should be suspected by patient clinical symptomatology; unfortunately, this one has been scarcely studied. OBJECTIVES To describe the semiology observed in patients experiencing non traumatic rhabdomyolysis and to identify which symptoms induced to the subject to go to the emergency room in order to facilitate the diagnostic procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied the patients with non traumatic rhabdomyolysis (creatinkinase &gt; 1,000 IU/l) which attended the emergency room in a one year period. We collected data regarding their clinical symptomatology as well as which of them was responsible of his/her coming to the emergency unit. Symptoms were classified in four groups: muscular, urinary, neurological and others. RESULTS We evaluated 49 patients. The relative frequency of each kind of symptoms was the following: muscular 51%, urinary 18%, neurological 67%, and others 47%. The absolute frequency of the symptoms which caused the consultation were: muscular 16%, urinary 2%, neurological 48%, others 22%, muscular and neurological associated 6%, and neurological and other associated 6%. CONCLUSION CK serum levels should be measured in all of the patients attending the emergency unit who exhibit some type of neurological manifestation.</dc:description>
