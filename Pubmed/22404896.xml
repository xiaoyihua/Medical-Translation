<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyse the causes for claims due to alleged malpractice in bariatric surgery and the results of the legal process. MATERIAL AND METHOD A review was carried out on the case files of claims for damages as a result of bariatric surgery presented to the Professional Liability Department of the Catalonian Medical Colleges Council from 1992 to 2009. The claims rate was calculated using a survey of bariatric surgeons. RESULTS A total of 49 cases were analysed, which represented 0.6% of the patients operated on. The patient died in 23 (47%) of the cases, 14% were left with serious after effects, 18% had mild after effects, and 21% made a complete recovery. The most frequent causes of death were peritonitis due to suture dehiscence (48%), and respiratory complications (17.4%). Retrospectively, malpractice was considered to have occurred in 10 (20%) of the sued cases due to lack of an adequate informed consent document, delay in recognising a complication, or an error in interpretation, or treatment of the complication. The doctor sued was convicted in 10 of the cases, 3 in a criminal court, and 7 in a civil court. There was acquittal in 19 cases, an out-of court settlement with payment of compensation in 4, withdrawal of the claim in 4, and judgement or sentence is still pending in 12 cases. CONCLUSION The study showed a relatively low rate of claims for complications associated with bariatric surgery. The number of convictions was relatively high. The early detection of surgical complications is essential in order to reduce legal claims associated with bariatric surgery.</dc:description>
