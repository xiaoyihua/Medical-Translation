<dc:description xml:lang="en">Antigenic macromolecules present in food can induce inflammatory allergic reaction in sensitized persons. The aim of the present work is the development of an animal model to detect food antigens based on hypersensitivity reaction after food ingestion. New Zealand rabbits were divided in 5 groups. Group 1 (GI): control. G2: Ovalbumin (OVA) sensitized. G3: sensitized and orally challenged with OVA. G4: OVA sensitized and phosphate buffer solution challenged (PBS). G5: sensitized and challenged with OVA. Samples from cecum were stained with Alcian Blue pH &lt; 1 for mast cells and with silver method for enteroendocrine cells (EEC). Other samples were immunostained with anti CD5 and CD25 monoclonal antibodies. Specific IgE levels were detected by PCA. Histopathology of G5 showed patchy edema, lymphangiectasia and eosinophilic infiltration. Results were expressed as cells per HPF (high power field); Mast cells in G1: 1.33; G2: 12.80 and G5: 10.20. Enteroendocrine cells in surface epithelium: G1: 1.6; G2: 6.0; G5: 4.2 and in deep epithelium: G1: 3.0; G2: 12.0 and G5: 7.3. Lymphocytes CD5+ in G1: 24.21: G2: 22.12 and G5: 23.97 and CD25+ in G1: 12.10: G2: 14.30 and G5: 21.68. Group 3 were similar to G1 and G4 to G2. We observed: mast cells increased in number probably due to OVA induced response. EEC showed an increase in sensitized animals because of higher expression of cytoplasmatic granules or differentiation from stem cells. Decrease in EEC number in challenged groups was likely to be based on vesicles release. Total T cells showed no significant differences among groups. CD 25+ cells were higher in sensitized and challenged animals. We concluded that rabbit model of sensitization and oral challenge is valid to study ingested food antigens and potential digestive pathologic reactions.</dc:description>
