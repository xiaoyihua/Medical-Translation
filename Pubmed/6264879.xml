<dc:description xml:lang="en">Rotavirus was investigated in the feces of 232 children under five years of age with acute infectious gastroenteritis by means of viral RNA electrophoretic technique. 15.1 per cent of cases were positive and no predominance was observed regarding age or seasonal period. Approximately 50 per cent corresponded to one of the two rotavirus types, byt type 2 (2 L) was predominant in the first six months of the year and type 1 (2 S) in the other six. Results are consistent with those obtained by other authors for it is considered that approximately 20 per cent of acute diarrheas during infancy are caused by viral agents.</dc:description>
