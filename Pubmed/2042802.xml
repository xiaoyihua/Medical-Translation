<dc:description xml:lang="en">A retrospective study of retinoblastoma was done during 1978-1987, analysing the clinics aspects of the entity. We found nineteen children during this period, from them eight were girls (42%) and eleven were boys (58%). Ages of diagnostic ranged between three months and four years, with and average of 17.53 months. Nine children (47%) were bilaterally affected. Leocokoria was the most common initial sign, followed by strabismus. Ophthalmoscopy was the diagnostic procedure used, and surgery the recommended therapeutic, using radiotherapy as a palliative method in the cases which surgery has no indications.</dc:description>
