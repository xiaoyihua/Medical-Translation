<dc:description xml:lang="es">Introduction. Cochrane Collaboration (CC) provides growing and readily accessible resource to help assure physicians that their care is base don detailed, critical, and current reviews of the best available evidence. The objective of this article is to make a bibliometric analysis of the systematic reviews (SR) published in the 50 Collaborative Review Groups (CRG) of the CC that are related with paediatrics. Methods. Bibliometric analysis of the Cochrane Database Systematic Reviews in CC, Issue 2, 2004. The following variables were registered in each CRG: number of SR and protocols, SR related with paediatrics, subject areas of study, type of study (diagnosis, treatment, prevention, prognosis, etc), authors. Results. At the moment of the suty there are 1915 SR and 1420 protocols registered in all the CRG. In 28 CRG we found some SR related with paediatrics, with a total of 395 SR (20,6% of all SR). The CRG with more SR related with paediatrics are Cochrane Neonatal Group (171 SR), Cochrane Airways Group (41), Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group (41), Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group (21) and Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (19). The main subject areas of study are peri-enonatology (mainly respiratory pathology), asthma and cystic fibrosis. Almost all the SR are about interventions for the treatment or prevention diseases. We identified selective clusters of secondary investigation, mainly in respiratory neonatal pathology (surfactant, modalities of respiratory support, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, etc). Discussion. The bibiometric analysis of CC show that one fifth of the published SR are related with paediatrics.  At the moment, the SR published in the different CRG support an evidence-based decision making mainly in the subject are of neonatology (mainly in respiratory pathology) and asthma. But we don´t found SR in other important and prevalent pathologies in infancy (bronchiolitis, meningitis, pneumonia, etc.), and that show that many therapies in Paediatrics persist without supportive evidence. Challenges for the future include the need for the preparation of SR of topics not yet covered and to keep an increasing number of SR about diagnostic test. Every decision in Paediatrics will have to be based on a systematic appraisal of the best evidence available in the context of the prevailing values and resources available (AU)</dc:description>
