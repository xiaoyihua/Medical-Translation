<dc:description xml:lang="en">The taxonomy of the dermatophyte Trichophyton megninii has been the subject of much discussion since it was first isolated by Sabouraud in 1893. Initially he named it Trichophyton à culture rose and later T. rosaceum. It has been confused with the Microsporum (Epidermophyton) gallinae described by Megnin. Nowadays most mycologists consider T. rosaceum to be a synonym of the T. megninii, although some French authors still use Sabouraud's denomination. It is an exclusively anthropophilic dermatophyte with a broad geographic distribution, but in general a low incidence in most countries, except in Portugal, Corsica and Sardinia where it causes infections of both hairy and glabrous skin zones and nails in humans. T. megninii is an uncommon cause of ringworm in Spain and is mainly restricted to Galicia, and even there the incidence is low; it has been isolated only five times in our clinical practice with two more cases described previously in the literature, and predominantly affects females. Case reports show that it produces slowly evolving lesions with little local symptomatology on the scalp and is recalcitrant to conventional antifungal treatment. Its identification in culture should be based on the macroscopical appearance of the colony and by its absolute requirement for 1-histidine.</dc:description>
