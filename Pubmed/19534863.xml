<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE We undertook this study to evaluate 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (2OCA) glue and suture for wound closure in the small bowel. METHODS This was a comparative and experimental study. Male and female domestic dogs (n = 10) underwent a 2.0-cm small bowel closure of two wounds. All of these had closure with 2OCA in the first wound. The controls (second wound in the same dog) were closed with suture. Four weeks later the wounds were observed to evaluate the repair. RESULTS Wound closure time and macrophage count were lower with the 2OCA glue than in the suture group. CONCLUSIONS 2OCA glue has the strength to seal a small bowel wound. The inflammatory response to the glue is less than that of the suture at 4 weeks. These properties may make it a suitable material for replacing suture in a small bowel wound.</dc:description>
