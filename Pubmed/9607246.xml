<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse by means of a group session and postal support the efficacy of health education (HE) on compliance with therapy for light-to-moderate essential Hypertension. DESIGN Controlled clinical trial with randomised distribution. SETTING Primary Care. PATIENTS 110 hypertense patients with new or uncontrolled Hypertension, for whom treatment with Trandolapril as a start or change of medication was indicated. INTERVENTIONS The patients were split into two groups at random, with observation for six months after inclusion in the study and monthly attendance: 1) Control group (CG) of 55 patients who received HE from their family doctor; 2) Intervention group (IG) of 55 patients controlled. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Patients were defined as compliant if their consumption was 80-110% of what was prescribed. The counting of pills was recorded. Percentages of compliant patients and mean compliance were analysed with the Chi squared and Student's t tests. 109 people completed, 77 of them women. Neither group differed as to age, sex, length of evolution, number of diseases or doses of drugs consumed. CONCLUSIONS Intervening in HE with a group session and postal follow-up is an efficacious measure to improve therapeutic compliance in Hypertension cases.</dc:description>
