<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this study was to first determine the nutritional state of a sample population of school children, and then analyze the distribution pattern of their subcutaneous fat layer. The sample was composed of 977 school children from the city and province of Granada (Spain). All of the children (524 girls and 452 boys) were 9-17 years of age. To study their nutritional state and the distribution of the subcutaneous fat layer, they were given a complete anthropometric evaluation, which included measuring their weight, height, body mass index, skin folds, and body perimeters. The results obtained showed a 23.01% prevalence of overweight in the female subjects and 20.81% in the male subjects. Furthermore, the female subjects had an obesity prevalence of 12.70% in comparison to the male subjects, whose obesity prevalence was 4.98%. The distribution pattern of subcutaneous fat was found to be mainly located in the central part of body. The high percentage of overweight and obesity along with the development of a central fat distribution pattern (neck, chest, and abdomen) in these school children is clear evidence of potential cardiovascular risk.</dc:description>
