<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To determine the general and specific conditions required in the official announcements of the different autonomous health services for the provision of vacant nursing positions as statutory nursing staff. METHOD A documentary review of the latest public employment offers (PEO) for statutory nursing staff of the 17 Spanish autonomous communities (AACC) was carried out, between June 2007 and August 2012. The variables related to the announcements method, the general requirements and the criteria used to evaluate the applicants, were reviewed. RESULTS All AACC use the public competition as the method for selecting applicants. The general requirements are uniform in the 17 official announcements. The most commonly used system today in the public competition is the multiple-choice test (58%), being necessary to obtain at least 50% of the marks to pass in all of them. At the public competition stage, the undergraduate, specialized and continuous education; professional experience, scientific, teaching activities and other merits are evaluated differently. The knowledge of the regional language is present in official announcements. The weight of the parts involved in the process is variable, with 50-50% and 60-40% being the most commonly used. CONCLUSIONS The general requirements that the applicants should meet are homogeneous, as well as the types of PEO. The competition processes of the AACC are very different from each other, and there is a great variability of criteria in the selection process based on the evaluation of the suitable merits, and the importance that each stage has on the competition.</dc:description>
