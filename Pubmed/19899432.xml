<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND previous studies have suggested an association between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), abnormal cervical smears and squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), but the underlying cause of this association is not well defined. OBJECTIVE To review Pap smear and biopsy results in SLE women compared with healthy controls and to identify traditional risk factors associated with abnormal smears. Retrospective cohort study. Sixty-two SLE patients and 1719 controls were included. Women with abnormal Pap smear results were referred to colposcopic biopsy histology. Information on traditional risk factors was obtained. Among SLE patients, activity score (Mex-SLEDAI) and immunosuppressive drugs exposure also were determined. RESULTS Fourteen (22%) out of 62 patients had abnormal Pap smear results, compared with 120 (7%) out of 1719 controls. Thirteen (92%) out of 14 patients showed SIL by histological examination, compared with 27 (22%) out of 120 controls. Two SLE women had condylomata. There were no significant differences in the use of immunosuppressive agents among SLE patients with and without SIL. CONCLUSION Abnormal Pap smears, SIL by biopsy and changes in the sexual behavioral were more common among SLE patients than in controls. The immunosuppressive drug exposure was not associated with abnormal Pap smears.</dc:description>
