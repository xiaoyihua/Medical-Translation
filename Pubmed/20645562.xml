<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) and ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) are the preferred surgical methods in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). OBJECTIVE To describe the results obtained from the surgical treatment in patients with FAP related to morbidity, mortality, rectal cancer and overall survival. METHODS We studied a retrospective cohort including all patients operated on with IPAA or IRA for FAP during the period of 1969 to 2000 at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran. RESULTS Twenty-six patients were included. IRA was performed in 9 patients and IPAA in 17. Surgical morbidity was observed in 5 patients (19.2%). Mean postoperative follow-up was 68.8 +/- 58.8 months (median 52.5 months, range 0-240 months). Functional results were similar in both groups. The five year survival in patients with IPAA and IRA was 100% and 55.6%, respectively (P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS In our institution, postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with FAP are similar to those published in the literature. IPAA seems to offer better results related to survival with similar functional results and postoperative complications.</dc:description>
