<dc:description xml:lang="en">Some genetic issues of hypertensive diseases are discussed, as well as some benefits of the study of these aspects in the clinical management of high blood pressure. Some characteristics of hypertension as a "civilization disease" are pointed out, particularly the combination of pathogenic genetic and environmental mechanisms. Interactions among genes and environment are described as well as rare examples of monogenic hypertension. Some genes with hypertensive action potential are mentioned. It is difficult to establish the connection among the polymorphisms and the development of hypertension or its complications and consequences. It is underlined the urgent need to establish the true importance of these already known polymorphisms, and other still undisclosed, in the Mexican population.</dc:description>
