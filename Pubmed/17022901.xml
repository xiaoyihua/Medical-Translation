<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Lipomas are the most frequent benign tumors of the digestive tract and 50% are localized in the colon. Most are found submucosally and may vary in their incidence, localization, symptoms and pathogenesis, making diagnosis difficult. We undertook this study to learn the different presentations of an ileocecal valve (ICV) lipoma and conduct a review of the literature due to this uncommon location. CASE PRESENTATION We present the case of a 78-year-old female with intermittent small bowel occlusion, abdominal distention and constipation. Colonoscopy showed a submucous tumor at the ICV, CT scan showed a tumor at the ICV with fat density. Laparotomy was performed with primary resection of the lesion by cecotomy, frozen section was reported as nonmalignant so a primary closure without ICV involvement was achieved. Definitive pathology revealed a benign lipoma. CONCLUSION It is important to know the different presentations of these benign tumors because if there is mucosal ulceration they can be mistaken for a malignant lesion and lead to greater resections. Resection is necessary if they are symptomatic or &gt;2 cm.</dc:description>
