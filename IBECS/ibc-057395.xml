<dc:description xml:lang="en">Equipment for continuous renal replacement therapies must provide efficiency and security. Every unithas four peristaltic roller pumps for: blood, reposition fluid, dialysis fluid and for effluent and an additionalsyring pump for anticoagulant (heparin). The most advanced monitors are provided with a fifth rollerpump to permit the use of citrate as anticoagulant or to permit the reinfusion in predilution (pre-hemofilter)and postdilution (post-hemofilter) simultaneously. And systems to check the pressure at differentpoints of the circuit: inlet (previous to the blood pump measuring negative pressures), pre-filter, outlet ofthe circuit (post-filter) and at the effluent. It is worthwhile that the software calculate several parameterssuch as the transmembrane pressure or the filtration fraction and desirable that it calculates de Kt/V ofurea. A detector (optic device) for blood leakage at the effluent line and other for air and foam (based onultrasounds or infrared emission) at the blood line previous to the patient entrance are mandatory. Nowadays,the most recent equipments are presented with tactile color TFT screens which show schemes thatfacilitate both the montage of the circuit kit and also the instruction of use of the different therapies: Continuoushemofiltration (CVVHF), Continuous hemodialysis (CVVHD), hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), etc. It isalso of interest the ability of connecting this equipments with other computers. Devices that permit thewarming of fluids and/or blood line are also necessary</dc:description>
