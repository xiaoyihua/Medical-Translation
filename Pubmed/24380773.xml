<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Non-specific back pain in children and adolescents has a high prevalence. The aim of this study is to show a Juvenile Back School (JBS) programme and its results in our hospital. MATERIAL AND METHOD A total of 139 patients referred to a Juvenile Back School for advice due to of pain, deformity or back asymmetry were included in a prospective observational study. VARIABLES age, gender, pain, correct postures, sports activities, adherence to JBS and appreciation of these parameters by their parents. VARIABLES were measured with a numerical pain scale and with a survey completed in the first session and 3 months after finishing the JBS. RESULTS A total of 119 patients finished the study (78 female and 41 male).The average was 13.97±2.29 years (9-20). Three months after JBS, the median pain intensity was reduced from 3 to 0 (P&lt;.0001). There was an improvement in patient postures from 21% to 83% (P&lt;.0001). Patients did not increase their sport activity after the JBS, although its regular practice was linked with pain improvement after JBS (P&lt;.02).Performing exercises did not lead to a decrease in pain. There was a poor correlation between parents and children in the evaluation of post-JBS pain. CONCLUSION A back school programme could probably contribute to reduce non-specific back pain and improve postural behaviour in young people.</dc:description>
