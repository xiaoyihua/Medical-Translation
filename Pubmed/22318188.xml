<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To compare the biochemical relapse-free survival between radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy in patients with localized prostate cancer of low and intermediate recurrence risk. METHODS A retrospective study of 435 patients with localized prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy was performed in 65% of patients and radiotherapy was in 35%. The Kaplan-Meier Estimator was used to assess the biochemical relapse-free survival and long-rank test, Breslow and Tarone-Ware to evaluate the differences between the groups with confidence intervals at 95%. RESULTS The median follow-up of the series was 60 months (3-106). Biochemical recurrence was diagnosed in 21% of patients: 22% of those were treated with prostatectomy and 19% with radiotherapy (p = 0.47). No significant differences were observed according to risk group (p = 0.60 in the low risk and p = 0.32 in the intermediate risk). Tree, five and seven-year actuarial biochemical recurrence-free survival for prostatectomy were 84%, 75%and 70%, while for radiotherapy were 97%, 84% and 64% respectively. CONCLUSIONS There are no significant differences in actuarial biochemical recurrence free survival in patients with localized prostate cancer of low and intermediate risk treated with prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Due to the crossing of the survival curves we do not rule out that with longer follow-up these results could be modified.</dc:description>
