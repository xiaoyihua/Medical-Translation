<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In this investigations, was carried out a neurocysticercosis (NC) prevalence study during seven months in the Instituto Neurológico de Antioquia with the purpose of known neurocysticercosis frequency as cause of epilepsy in patients older than ten years that we attended in our institute. MATERIAL AND METHODS Computerized tomographies (CT) were made to 503 patients, with epilepsy, 24.7% of them were CT positive for NC. Cysticercosis enzyme linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) and enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) test were made to 178 patients, 19.6% were EITB positive for NC and 5% ELISA positive for NC. Results. From this result it is possible to infer that about 8% of the 503 patients with epilepsy had cysticercosis, according to EITB that is the golden assay for NC. The CT and ELISA test had 94.3% and 27.7% sensitivity, respectively, according to EITB. The specificity of the CT for NC was 49.2% and specificity for ELISA test was 100% as compared to EITB. The multivariate analysis with logistic regression allowed to establish association of positive EITB with factors such as male sex, eating pork, headaches and multiple lesions in CT. CONCLUSIONS Prevention and education actions are necessary for the interruption of the neurocysticercosis transmission chain in order to diminish the high prevalence of epilepsy in the country and its complication and consequences.</dc:description>
