<dc:description xml:lang="en">Trypanosoma cruzi may be transmitted to a susceptible human through different routes: a superficial lesion in the skin, such as a scraping of the small wound produced by the hematophagous triatomid bug vector, which becomes infected with its contaminated feces; the placenta, from the infected mother to the product of conception; a transfusion from an infected donor, or even by ingestion of diverse foods infected or contaminated with the parasite. Whichever may be the transmission of the protozoon, it is advisable to have in mind that it is able to produce an asymptomatic or a symptomatic infection, being possible in both cases, using appropriated methods, to detect the T. cruzi and/or the antibodies generated. From the clinical stand-point, Chagas' Disease may present itself as acute or as a chronic disease. Habitually, the acute disease is characterized by general involvement, fever, hepato-splenomegaly, polidenopathy, and occasionally myocarditis and/or encephalitis, whereas, the chronic form of the disease is characterized by presenting itself in an isolated way or combined, chronic myocardiopathy, megaesophagous or megacolon. At any rate, the problems center in the possibility of a reasonable diagnostic assurance which permits the adoption of adequate therapeutic measures. Some facts, which may help to confront these problems are: a) The epidemiological antecedents (origin in an endemic area, personal knowledge of the vector or of being bitten by it, whether the mother or other relatives are affected by the disease, etc.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
