<dc:description xml:lang="en">In France, scientific research has always been considered an important activity. The aim of this article is to present data with reference to French research, mainly research in Medical and Biological Sciences. This includes a description of the Research Career in the two main institutions, CNRS (National Research Center) and INSERM (National Institute of Health and Medical Research). Investment in science is substantial in France originating both from the Scientific Institutions of the State and from a large number of Private Organizations. France is the second European country, after Germany, as far as the number of national and private investigators is concerned. CNRS covers all the dominions of science, including Natural Sciences, Mathematics, Biology and Medical Sciences. One of its main structures is undoubtedly its National Committee of Research which is responsible for the evaluation of the laboratories and research projects, of the incorporation of investigators in the Research Career and of their promotion. This Committee includes, among others, members of the Research Career elected among themselves. In parallel, INSERM is centered in both basic and applied Medical Research, and is supervised by a Scientific Committee and eleven specialized Commissions. In both institutions, the Research Career incorporates investigators as civil servants after very competitive examinations; their performance is evaluated by specialized committees as well as by national and international experts.</dc:description>
