<dc:description xml:lang="en">From the first day in prison, convicts are exposed to several types of diseases, many of which can be prevented by vaccination. During captivity, the risk of acquiring these types of diseases is known to be higher than outside prison. This increased risk can be explained by structural and logistical factors in prison, as well as by acquired behaviour before and during captivity. Furthermore, for many prisoners captivity is an opportunity to access the health care system and therefore a chance to update their adult vaccination status. The traditional concept suggesting that prisons are primarily designed to ensure public safety should be complemented by this aspect of health, which is a broader approach to public safety.</dc:description>
