<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cardiac insufficiency-failure is a chronic cardiovascular disease whose prevalence, incidence, mortality rate and health system costs are increasing. Patients suffering from cardiac insufficiency-failure have co-life-threatening risks which lead to severe limitations in daily activities and decrease their perception of living a quality lifestyle. Their evaluation helps to plan out future treatment and serves to predict their response to treatment. Many patients give more importance to their lifestyle quality rather than their lifespan. In this review, the authors describe the variables which affect the life quality of patients who suffer cardiac insufficiency-failure and what are the instruments more commonly employed. The authors ran a bibliographical search on Medline and Cuiden. The authors analyze five articles; they prioritize publication date, distinct magazines, study sector source of each article and the diverse profession the authors of each article has.</dc:description>
