<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE to develop, validate the contents and verify the reliability of a risk classification protocol for an Emergency Unit. METHOD the content validation was developed in a University Hospital in a country town located in the state of Sao Paulo and was carried out in two stages: the first with the individual assessment of specialists and the second with the meeting between the researchers and the specialists. The use of the protocol followed a specific guide. Concerning reliability, the concordance or equivalent method among observers was used. RESULTS the protocol developed showed to have content validity and, after the suggested changes were made, there were excellent results concerning reliability. CONCLUSION the assistance flow chart was shown to be easy to use, and facilitate the search for the complaint in each assistance priority.</dc:description>
