<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To review the results and adverse effects to botulinum toxin type A (BTA), Botox, in cerebral palsy (CP) spastic and/or dystonic in an open prospective study. MATERIAL AND METHODS The first 39 cases treated were analyzed. They received 1-2 doses and were followed up to 12 months. BTA indications were wide: to improve limb function, to avoid surgical orthopedics or improve hygienics or dressing. O'Brien Global Assessment Scale (scored by neurologist, physiotherapist or parents), Ashworth spasticity scale, functional scale for dystonic upper limb (Sindou-Millet) and exam of position of foot, knee and hip, were used. RESULTS Total doses/session was 1-10 U/kg. We observed adverse effects in 6 cases (15.4%), always mild and lasting only few days (general weakness, tiredness, instability). Positive effects lasted 4 months in upper limbs and 4.5 months in lower limbs. In upper limbs (9 cases injected) it was observed a global positive result of mild grade in 11-40%, moderate without functional improvement in 11-22%, and moderate-important with functional improvement in 40-78% of patients, being patient's evaluation the best and physiotherapist's one the worst. Spasticity improved 2 or more grades in Ashworth scale in 7/9 cases. Dystonia improved in proportion to dose. In lower limbs gastrocnemius muscles were injected in 29 cases (55 sessions), adductors in 14 cases (33 sessions), ischiotibialis in 8 cases (27 sessions), posterior tibialis in 8 cases (12 sessions). It was observed a global improvement null or mild in 20%, moderate without functional change in 35-44%, and moderate or important with functional improvement in 35-44%, with significative correlation between parent's, physiotherapist's and neurologist's scores. Spasticity was also significatively reduced after treatment. It went down 2 or more grades in Ashworth scale in 40% of ischiotibialis, 60% of adductors and 65% of gastrocnemius, in general with a doses-effect association. Foot position in walking improved from moderate to important grade in 2/3 of cases, as improved foot position while standing. Knee flexion and hip hyperadduction were reduced moderate-importantly in 60% and 40% of cases respectively. CONCLUSION BTA is highly effective in the treatment of CP, and if associate with physiotherapy long and even permanent effect can be achieved.</dc:description>
