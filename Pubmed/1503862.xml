<dc:description xml:lang="en">Between 1966 and 1990, 171 cases of Hirschsprung's disease, of which 21 were total colonic aganglionosis, were surgically treated at our centre. In the first period up to 1978, in which total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was not used, six of 11 patients died. From 1979 to 1990, ten further cases were treated with the support of TPN and only one death occurred, in a child with aganglionosis up to one-half of the yeyunum. The 14 surviving patients were treated, ten with the Duhamel technique, two with Rehbein and one with Boley procedure. The Lester Martin technique was not used. Follow-up of ten of then patients showed their good general condition. The number of daily bowel movements, on the average three, was higher than normal. Studies of serum iron, vitamin B12 and folic acid absorption showed slightly low values, which require close monitoring. Hydrogen and fecal test were normal.</dc:description>
