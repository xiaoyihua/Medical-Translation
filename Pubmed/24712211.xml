<dc:description xml:lang="en">The number of patients with spine conditions has grown exponentially in recent years leading to an increase in the number of cases requiring surgical treatment. Currently vertebral fusion surgery with a transpedicular approach represents the most commonly used technique to treat any type of vertebral disorder. The morphometric characteristics of vertebrae, particularly the pedicle, determine the size of pedicular implants, including width and length, as well as the shape and direction of the screw and its ideal angulation at the time of introduction. Knowing these characteristics is important to prevent injuring important adjacent structures and to decrease the postoperative complication rate. In recent decades numerous studies on the morphometric characteristics of the vertebral pedicle have been conducted in different populations to determine its real dimensions by means of direct measurement and imaging methods. These studies have concluded that there are significant differences in these measurements among the different ethnic groups, races, genders, ages and the vertebral regions studied. This paper analyzes the different morphometric studies of the pedicle and all the other vertebral elements studied in Mexico and the rest of the world and explain the importance of their knowledge and surgical application for the correct development of vertebral fusion surgery with a transpedicular approach.</dc:description>
