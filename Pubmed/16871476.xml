<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To determine the rate of prevalence and the clinical-epidemiological and therapeutic characteristics of primary headaches in Zimbabwe. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A descriptive study was carried out on the working population at the National Psychiatric Hospital in Zimbabwe. The International Headache Society classification was used. Sample size, which was calculated by means of the program EpiInfo 2002, was 175 workers, who were selected by simple random sampling. RESULTS The rate of prevalence of primary headaches was 37.1%. 66.1% of cases were between 20 and 39 years old. 29.2% had a family history of headaches. Tension-type headaches (47.7%) and common migraine (30.8%) were the predominant types. Onset of headaches occurred before the age of 15 years in 46.12% of patients. The most frequent location was cervical, which was found in 40% of cases. The most frequent precipitating factors were menstruation (24.6%) and stress (21.5%). The most frequent accompanying symptom was tearing (27.7%). 40% suffered headaches three or more times a month. The predominant symptomatic treatment was paracetamol (83.1%) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (52.3%). Beta blockers and amitriptyline were used as prophylactic therapy for the episodes of headache in 18.5% and 13.8% of cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of primary headaches is high among the working population under study.</dc:description>
