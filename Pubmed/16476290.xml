<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present the case of a 50-year-old Latin American woman who consulted her physician because of recent pruritic lesions on her arms and thighs. During the examination, we observed multiple flat papules on the limbs, as well as hypopigmented macules on the trunk which, according to the patient, began to appear during childhood. A histological study was performed on both types of lesions, and showed some enlarged keratinocytes with light blue cytoplasm in the upper layers of the epidermis. More than 20 types of HPV associated with EV (HPV-EV) have been described. Although it was previously thought that these were specific to EV, new molecular biology techniques have made it possible to isolate HPV-EV sequences in skin diseases, both benign and malignant, with epidermal hyperproliferation in the immunocompetent population.</dc:description>
