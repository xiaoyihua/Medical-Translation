<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Valsartan is an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist. Clinical studies have shown that this is an effective and well tolerated drug. AIM To compare valsartan with other commonly used antihypertensives in a National multicentric study. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 1997 and 1998, a pharmacological surveillance of patients with mild or moderate hypertension, coming from different regions of the country, was carried out. Patients were followed during 8 weeks. In the group treated with valsartan, the initial dose was 80 mg/day. After four weeks of therapy, and according to patient's response the dose of valsartan or of the other antihypertensives was modified. RESULTS Five hundred ninety three patients, aged 59 years old as a mean, were included in the study. Of these 434 (265 female) received valsartan and 159 (101 female) other antihypertensive drugs. Fifteen percent of patients treated with valsartan and 25% of patients with other medications required a dose change at four weeks, due to lack of response (p &lt; 0.01). At week eight, 1.5% of patients with valsartan and 17.4% of patients with other medications reported adverse effects such as cough, headache, edema or flushing (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In this Chilean observational multicentric study, valsartan proved to be more effective and to cause less adverse effects than commonly used medications in hypertensive patients.</dc:description>
