<dc:description xml:lang="en">This is the experience of 18 years of attending newborn infants suffering from congenital Chagas' disease. From a variety of sources in the provincial health system, the Mother-Child Hospital in the city of Salta, country hospitals and out-patient care, 102 newborn and infants were detected and diagnosed. The newborn were classified into two main groups, one being sub-classified according to diagnostic opportunity. The diagnostic methodology, clinical presentation, treatment and follow-up of the children under care are described, the characteristics of the experience analyzed and the specific conditions of the diagnostic discussed. Also described are the recommendations used in the province in the perinatal Chagas control program, as well as the conclusions reached by this experience.</dc:description>
