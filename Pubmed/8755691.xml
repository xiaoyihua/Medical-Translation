<dc:description xml:lang="en">Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice. Atrial fibrillation is characterized by a complete disorganization in atrial electrical activity and sinus node pacemaker activity is lost. The physiopathological mechanisms of atrial fibrillation is based on the simultaneous presence of multiple wavelets in the atria. These multiple wavelets are continuously changing in localization, direction and duration resulting in a chaotic electrical activity. This theory has been confirmed by several studies using detailed mapping of the atria during atrial fibrillation. Also, the functional nature of the reentrant circuits during atrial fibrillation has also been demonstrated. For an episode of atrial fibrillation to perpetuate, the wavelength of the cardiac impulse has to be adapted to the length of the atria. Modifications of the wavelength by drugs may result in perpetuation or in termination of the atrial fibrillation episode.</dc:description>
