<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective To explore the components that health professionals use to build and define the concept of Public Health as a specific area of knowledge and intervention within public health policies. Method A qualitative analysis of content was performed based on 20 semi-structured interviews with health professionals participating in the demonstration project conducted by the Public Health Agency of Garrotxa in Catalonia, Spain (2009-2012). Results Health professionals use the health-disease continuum to provide guidance to all State policies on health: public health is usually related to health and care regarding disease. Also, professionals contrast public health against health care to define and delineate each intervention area based on the approach, the objectives, the demand, the timing, the invisibility and the consistency. Discussion The continuum health-disease is a relevant element to guide public health policies. It is necessary to develop the concept of wellbeing to act under a positive view of health. Moreover, recognizing the multiplicity of elements that affect public health makes it permeable to the initiatives of other institutions, while they turn to Public Health in other areas of intervention.</dc:description>
