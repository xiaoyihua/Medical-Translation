<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Foot disease is common among the elderly. Little is known about its prevalence and impact over mobility, gait and tendency to fall. MATERIAL AND METHODS A geriatric history was taken from 171 women living in a long-term care facility. Photographs were taken of the feet and evaluated by an orthopaedic surgeon and a dermatologist. A multivariate analysis was made to assess de effect of the independent variables over mobility, gait and tendency to fall. RESULTS The foot diseases most commonly found were hammer toes (122), callus (79) and peripheral vascular disease (74). Hallux rigidus (OR 24.897, 95% CI, 1.231-503.542) and peripheral vascular disease (OR 2.481, 95% CI, 1.095-5.623) seemed to be associated with changes in gait; both where associated with dependency on instrumental activities of daily living (OR 44.166, 95% CI, 2.402-812.233, and OR 2.659, 95% CI, 1.069-6.615). Hallux rigidus was related to falls (OR 19.27, 95% CI, 1.102-337.26). Tinea pedis was associated with dependency in activities of daily living (OR 11.52, 95% CI, 1.325-100.125). CONCLUSIONS Foot disorders are common in the elderly. Only hallux rigidus and peripheral vascular disease had an impact on function and gait.</dc:description>
