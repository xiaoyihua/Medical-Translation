<dc:description xml:lang="en">A series of 40 children (average age 8,7 years) with hepatic hydatic disease is presented. The clinical diagnosis was based on palpation of the tumour and/or hepatomegaly in 95% (38 patients). Other symptoms such as pain, fever and jaundice were less frequent (47,5%, 22,50% and 12,50%, respectively). Other diagnostic tests yielded the following results: the Casoni skin test was positive in 68,57%, the investigation of antibodies in 40% and the Weinberg reaction in 38,70%. The ultrasonography which was carried out only on the last two patients was definitive. The scintigraphy carried out on 30 patients was positive in 93,33%. Due to the polymorphism of the disease all surgical proposals are considered to be initially acceptable. However, the high rate of bile involvement resulting from our experience (55%) has induced us to favour the Lagrot surgical technique with routine surgical colangiography in 16 patients in order to achieve short postoperative periods (10,3 days) and 6,25% of morbidity (one case of biliary fistula). Following all surgical procedures, there was no mortality. No recurrence has been found within a follow-up time ranging from 1 to 14 years.</dc:description>
