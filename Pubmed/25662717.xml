<dc:description xml:lang="en">Statins are the most widely used drugs for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and those associated with atherosclerosis. About 25 million people are on statin therapy in the world. Although they are well tolerated by most patients and have a safety profile, some patients have muscle level alterations. The biological effects associated with these drugs are known as pleiotropic; they are of such interest and diversity that explains, in part, some of the actions of statins, especially in relation to inflammation and the immune system. Some patients have certain immune disorders that can turn into an undesirable clinical expression. Recent studies have shown that they can trigger autoimmune phenomena. Pathologies have been described in which these agents act as triggers such as immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy or indirectly in dermatomyositis or autoimmune hepatitis, among others. Given the high number of people being treated with statins, we believe that this is a clinically relevant problem and therefore worthy of study.</dc:description>
