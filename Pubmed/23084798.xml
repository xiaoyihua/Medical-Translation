<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE This article analyses the burden of disease in adolescents and young people in Spain in 2008. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional population-based study. We estimated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by sex and cause for subjects aged 15-29 years. Data sources were used: 1) National death records by age, sex and cause; 2) Population data (both in July 2008); and 3) Estimates of the disability pattern for European countries with very low mortality. RESULTS In 2008, adolescents and young people lost 786,479 DALYs (414,346 in males). Non-communicable diseases generated 661,282 DALYs (84% of the total). The main specific causes of disease burden were: unipolar depression (16% of DALYs), alcohol use disorders (11%), migraine (9%), bipolar disorder (7%), schizophrenia (6%), road traffic accidents (5%) and drug addiction disorders (5%). CONCLUSIONS The burden of disease expressed in DALYs can define the loss of health in adolescents and young people. At these ages, health promotion and protection are essential to prevent the onset of disease in adulthood.</dc:description>
