<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify the social representation guiding decisions of parents of teenage drug users to face consumption of their children. MATERIAL AND METHODS A qualitative study using free lists, characterization questionnaires, and in-depth interviews was performed among 60 systematically selected parents of young drug users who were receiving treatment in Centros de Integración Juvenil. Data analysis included correlations and interpretive analysis. RESULTS Three stages were identified: 1) discovery of the addiction, characterized by parental disappointment; 2) permanence: The highest in duration, resource investment, and losses; and 3) withdrawal: Featured by seeking health services. CONCLUSIONS The representation that guided parental decisions was "the offer of a better world", which stemmed from the social, cultural, and family context that revolves around consumption and that was sustained by two beliefs: "Learning from mistakes" and "where there is a will there is a way".</dc:description>
