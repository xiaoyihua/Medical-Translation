<dc:description xml:lang="en">An experimental model of chronic alcohol abuse is developed, in order to study the hypothalamic-pituitary testicular axis in the rat. For this purpose basal plasma prolactin, gonadotropins, testosterone and estradiol have been measured. Also these hormones were studied after LHRH or hCG stimulation. This experimental model allows us to study the role of alcohol in hypogonadism induction. Chronic alcohol administration resulted in an inconstant decrease in plasma testosterone levels and very diminished response of it to hCG. Along with these modifications, there was an increase in basal plasma estrogen levels, as has been shown in the human. The decrease in plasma LH levels in alcoholic rats together with a normal response to LHRH suggest a toxic role of alcohol at higher levels than the pituitary. The existence of a hyperprolactinemic state under chronic alcohol ingestion is confirmed. The decrease in plasma prolactin levels after LHRH administration suggests that prolactin and gonadotropin secretion are very closely related.</dc:description>
