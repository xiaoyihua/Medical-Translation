<dc:description xml:lang="en">Patent expiry dates for early biotechnological drugs is giving rise to the availability of biosimilar drugs. According to the EMEA, these are defined as drugs with a biotechnological origin that have proven comparable to their reference product once the latter's patent expired. Modifications in the manufacturing process of biotechnological medications or treatment changes from one biotechnological molecule to another have not been debated until these biosimilar drugs have become available. It is then that, among other issues, the potential risks of their substitution for reference molecules became controversial. EMEA guidelines for biosimilar drug approval grant that these will be as effective and safe as any other newly available biotechnological medicinal product, or as any other drug undergoing changes in its manufacturing processes once marketed. Their availability will promote competition and reduce the high financial impact healthcare systems endure following the introduction of new therapies based on biotechnological drugs.</dc:description>
