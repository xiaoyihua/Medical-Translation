<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to evaluate health care workers' theoretical knowledge and skill in managing the dry powder Turbuhaler. We studied 118 individuals in three groups: 50 nurses, 34 medical residents and 34 staff physicians. Theoretical knowledge was evaluated by a questionnaire specifically designed for the purpose. Skill in managing the device was analyzed by evaluating a practical demonstration of the inhaling technique generally recommended, using a placebo inhaler. Six percent of staff physicians, 3% of the residents and 2% of the nurses answered the theoretical questionnaire correctly. Twenty-one percent of the staff physicians, 15% of the residents and 6% of the nurses inhaled correctly. However, when skill in managing the inhaler was evaluated against the maneuvers recommended by the manufacturer (which do not oblige exhaling before inhaling through the device and then holding the breath), there was significant improvement: 41% of the staff physicians, 23% of the residents, and 20% of the nurses inhaled correctly. We can conclude by saying that: a) our health care workers' general knowledge about how to handle the Turbuhaler device is deficient; b) the proportion of correct inhalation maneuvers observed doubles when these are assessed according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and c) health care workers should receive specific training in the inhalation techniques required for using the various devices usually prescribed.</dc:description>
