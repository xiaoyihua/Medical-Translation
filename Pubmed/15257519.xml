<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The availability of the interferon beta in its three forms at the moment available in our country and of glatiramer acetate has marked a point of flexion in the natural history of multiple sclerosis (MS), but the high cost of these treatments cause that its use is questioned. In this work we have studied the effectiveness and efficiency of the processing with interferon beta, and the cost-utility of these treatments in MS in Spain has been also analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS For this work we studied 102 patients affected of RR MS, treated with the three interferons beta which we have available in our country. We used as control 330 patients who had participated in the pivotal clinical interferon trials with both interferon beta 1a. In these patients in addition to effectiveness data, we have studied the disability measured as area below curve and the quality of life (AVACs). We also calculated the economical costs, considering the relation cost-utility in our country. RESULTS Besides to confirm the data of effectiveness of three interferons, in this study a saving of 23 days/year is demonstrated what corresponds to 0.063 AVACs. The additional cost of interferons is greater than the avoided cost until the fifth year of treatment in which the tendency is reversed in favor of the group of treated patients, if we assume that the same effectiveness that we found in the first years is maintained in the long term. CONCLUSION The use of the treatment with interferon beta is justified by its effectiveness, efficacy and efficiency. The additional cost of the treatment will be compensated in the long term if the effectiveness of the interferon beta is maintained.</dc:description>
