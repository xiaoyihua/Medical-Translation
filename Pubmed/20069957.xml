<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since its start, HIV infection has been related to psychopathological disorders, but at present times, the prevalence of psychiatric pathologies lies at a significantly high level, a factor which justifies that problems derived from care of HIV infected patients during their hospitalization multiply their complexity when being kept in a hospital becomes associated with emotional and behavioral conditioners derived from psychopathological disorders associated with the HIV-infection binomially and these require specific individualized intervention strategies agreed upon by multidisciplinary teams of experts. The authors fend off situations associated with this infection's process which have the greatest risk in order to link up behavioral problems during hospitalization and to develop intervention strategies and techniques to, in a prompt manner detect and deal with possible behaviors which could interfere in the progress of treatment and in the therapeutic program during enforced hospitalization, be those interventions either specific one time actions or progressive actions depending on the pertinent circumstances and needs. Based on actual professional experiences in hospital situations created by these kinds of patients and by the participation of groups of experts to improve treatment given, the authors point out the necessity to develop a specific treatment plan which responds to these patients' psycho-emotional needs by means of a theoretical justification of the proposed treatment. Psychological interventions and emotional help are the only ways to facilitate a perception of control to those affected, to reduce the emotional impact, to maximize treatment success and to promote attitudes and behaviors which enable a patient to confront his/her state of health and self-regulation of their treatment. To these ends, it is essential that a multidisciplinary team becomes involved to deal with this problem from a bio-psycho-social perspective and to include physiological, emotional and behavioral by means of individual interventions which must be derived from specific treatment plans.</dc:description>
