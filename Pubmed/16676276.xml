<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The origin of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) and orbital pseudotumour (OP) is not fully understood. It is acknowledged as having an unspecific granulomatous inflammatory nature in different locations. Although there are differences between the clinical features of the two conditions, they also share a number of physiopathogenetic, therapeutic and, in some cases, iconographic similarities. Possible clinical recurrences are common in the two conditions and a broad differential diagnosis is required in all cases. Yet, the association of both processes in the same patient, with radiological proof of the migration of the inflammatory injury, is not frequent. CASE REPORT We report the case of a male patient with a long history of recurring unilateral painful ophthalmoplegia that was sensitive to steroids; criteria for THS were fulfilled and there was later development of homolateral OP, six years after the onset of his symptoms. The findings in serial studies conducted with magnetic resonance imaging must be highlighted. The patient was submitted to a surgical intervention to treat the orbital injury and a chronic inflammatory process was observed in the fibrotic phase. CONCLUSIONS Inflammatory pseudotumour and THS perhaps have more points in common than has traditionally been accepted. To our knowledge few cases of the above-mentioned association have been reported in the same patient. When confronted by cases of painful ophthalmoplegia with excessive recurrences the physician must consider the possibility of other alternative diagnoses.</dc:description>
