<dc:description xml:lang="en">A case report was presented in which a patient developed vegetative pyoderma gangrenosum that was concomitant with acute renal failure; this led to the critical condition of the patient. He was initially treated with systemic antibiotics because his clinical picture was considered to be pyodermitis, but the response was unsatisfactory. After being treated with levamizol and alfa interferon, an improvement in his general condition and skin lesions was observed. Then surgical exeresis was successfully performed, with skin self-grafting in the face and penis lesions. Pyoderma gangrenosum lesions relapsed but they were treated with prednisone, and then there was a rapid elimination of lesions every time they came up.</dc:description>
