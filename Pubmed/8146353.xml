<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors examined 70 original samples obtained from 70 women seen at the Nuevo Veranillo Community Health Center because of suspected Mycoplasma infection. 23 (33%) of the cultures were positive for Mycoplasma. The microscopic and chemical characteristics identified 3 (13%) as Ureaplasma urealyticum, 9 (39%) were Mycoplasma hominis and 11 (48%) were positive for both organisms. The rate of positive cultures for Mycoplasma was high, which could be an important finding since these organisms are associated to a variety of pathologic conditions in adults of both sexes, in pregnant women and in their offspring.</dc:description>
