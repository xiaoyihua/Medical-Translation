<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The two structural genes encoding the human α-globin chains are located on the short arm of chromosome 16. Normal individuals have four genes α (αα/αα). α-thalassemias are usually produced by the deletion of one, two, three, or four α genes. Deletion of both α genes within the same chromosome (α° thalassemia) is commonly observed in individuals from the Mediterranean basin and Southeast Asia. MATERIAL AND METHODS We study two natural families of Madrid with microcytic hypochromic anemia. The DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes was digested with different restriction enzymes and hybridization with probes of gene cluster α. The ends of the deletion were characterized by combining the techniques of Southern blot, PCR and FISH. RESULTS We present two new mutations of α° thalassemia in two Spanish families, not previously described in the literature. The deletion (--(ED)) is ∼80 kb with the break point 5' in the coordinate +100 (± 3 kb), whereas the end 3'HVR places in the coordinate 178±750 bp. The second deletion (--(GP)) is more extensive, with loss of 145 kb, placing the deletion in the end 5' between the coordinates 34 and 37, respecting therefore the telomere. In the centromeric region the breakpoint places as the previous one in the coordinate 178±1.4 bp. CONCLUSIONS In both mutations both alpha genes were deleted, the gene θ and the region HS40. The exact identification of these deletions is essential to determine the function of the genes α with a view to a possible genetic diagnosis.</dc:description>
