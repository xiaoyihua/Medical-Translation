<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The purpose of this paper is to assess the survival and the different factors predisposing to increased local and overall complications in a group of patients treated surgically for bone metastases. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 97 patients were included in our study, 45 females and 52 males. Mean age was 59 years (range 22-81) and the mean follow-up was 23 months (range 3-76). Were performed 104 surgical interventions. Patient survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Complications, recurrences and the most significant factors were analyzed. RESULTS Overall patient survival was 73% at one year, 47% at 2 years, and 6% at 5 years. Patient survival was greater in patients with a histologic diagnosis of metastatic renal cancer (p &gt; 0.05) and a higher incidence of local relapses (p &gt; 0.05). Intralesional surgery significantly affected the relapses. CONCLUSIONS Patients with metastatic renal cancer had the greatest survival rate. However, they were associated with a higher rate of local relapses and postoperative failure.</dc:description>
