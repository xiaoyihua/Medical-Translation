<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this paper we report on a survey aimed at comparing utilization patterns and institutional coverage of health services between insured and non-insured populations. Our results show that under fixed socioeconomic characteristics, and for the same health problems, the non-insured group had a utilization rate 1.5 times smaller than that corresponding to the insured. Institutional coverage also showed important variations: only 31.8% of the group potentially served by the Secretary of Health (non-insured group) had actually demanded care, while the corresponding figure for the insured group (those with right to use the services provided by the diverse social security institutions) was 57.6%. On the other hand, private services utilization was 1.7 times higher for the non-insured population. These results point to the need for alternative and more equitable health care models in Mexico.</dc:description>
