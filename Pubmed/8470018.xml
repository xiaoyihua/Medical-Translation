<dc:description xml:lang="en">A comparative regional-scale evaluation of the epidemiological impact of low volume (LV) spray of bendiocarb and the conventional spray of DDT against malaria in an endemic area of northern Chiapas was carried out. Three Anopheline species were found: Anopheles pseudopunctipennis, An. albinanus and An. argyritarsis. The most prevalent was An. pseudopunctipennis, a species we suspect may be involved in the transmission of most malaria cases. This species showed high levels of resistance to DDT. However, this insecticide had a long residual effect in wall bioassays, with mortalities &gt; or = 95 per cent for up to 21 weeks in wood, sticks and plaster. Susceptibility to bendiocarb was total, and mortality to LV bendiocarb was &gt; or = 75 per cent for up to 16 weeks in wood, sticks and straw. Very low numbers of mosquitoes were found throughout the evaluation, although malaria transmission continued in control villages (sprayed with DDT), as well as treated villages (sprayed with LV bendiocarb). No plasmodium infected mosquitoes were found, perhaps due to a very small sample size. The LV spray methodology was found to be 1.7 times more effective than conventional spraying in reducing malaria incidence. A net reduction of 1.6 times in insecticide application time was also found, which would allow spraying at the right time, especially when urgent control measures have to be applied, such as in malaria outbreaks. Finally, the new methodology costs 2.2 times more than the conventional ddt spraying, but if the potential of using spray workers in other activities is considered, costs would be comparable to those of DDT spraying.</dc:description>
