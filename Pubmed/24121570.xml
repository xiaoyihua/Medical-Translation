<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Dopamine agonists (DA) effectively reduce tumor size of macroprolactinomas, with the consequent improvement of eventual visual impairment. AIM To study the visual outcomes in patients with macroprolactinoma treated with DA. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective cohort study which included patients with macroprolactinoma controlled at a Neuro-endocrinology and Neuro-ophthalmology Department between 1997 and 2011, and treated exclusively with DA (bromocriptine or cabergoline). Patients who were operated or had previous radiotherapy and those with an incomplete follow up, were excluded. We analyzed and compared the visual status before and after the beginning of DA treatment. RESULTS Thirty one patients aged 8 to 59 years, were included. Eighteen patients (58%) had visual impairment at the moment of diagnosis (group 1) and 13 had no alterations (group 2). Mean follow up was 36.5 months. Fifteen patients from group 1 (83%) had visual improvement, two remained stable (11 %) and one had a visual deterioration (6%). In group 2, only one non-compliant patient had a visual deterioration. CONCLUSIONS DAs are effective in the management of neuro-ophthalmic complications associated to macroprolactinomas and should be considered as first choice therapy in these tumors.</dc:description>
