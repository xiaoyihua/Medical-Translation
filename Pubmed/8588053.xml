<dc:description xml:lang="en">Xanthan production from Xanthomonas campestris was studied by a mechanically shaken fermentor. Influence of glucose concentration, aeration of culture media, rheology of broths and pH control was evaluated. Different aeration conditions based on variation of stirring rates were assayed. Substrate concentration was determined according to the Miller method, and polymer production was performed by the Cadmus method. The higher xanthan levels (i.e. 2.3%) were obtained at 750 rpm, with 1 v/v. min. In such conditions, viscosity ranges about 7000 cPoise and a low level of dissolved oxygen were detected in the culture medium. Xanthan production was influenced by the glucose concentration and the presence of amaranth within the culture medium. In the processes wherein an automatic control of pH was performed, the polymer concentration did not increase regarding to processes involving regular pH evolution.</dc:description>
