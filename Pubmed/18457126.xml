<dc:description xml:lang="en">The survival, reproduction and embryonic development of Strombus pugilis, were determined during a period of ten months under laboratory conditions. Seven progenitors were collected in Contoy Island, Quintana Roo, Mexico and later transferred to the laboratory, where they were placed in aquarium with 80 1 of sea water and fed with "pellets". A total of 30 egg masses were collected, one on September and the other on April. The estimated total length of one egg mass was 11.24 m; the mean number of embryos obtained per 2 cm was 264, obtaining an estimated total of 157 500 embryos in the egg mass. The means of the physical-chemical parameters during the study were: salinity 37.6 +/- 0.5% per hundred, pH 7.5 +/- 0.5 and temperature 28 +/- 0.2 degrees C. The maintenance and water recirculation system used to sustain the breading stock is excellent both for reproduction of the organism and for obtaining egg masses under controlled conditions.</dc:description>
