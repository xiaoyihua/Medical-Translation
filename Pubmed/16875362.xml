<dc:description xml:lang="en">During menopause, some women experience symptoms which can interfere with their living quality. Some of these symptoms are the so-called vasomotor symptoms which include suffocations, hot flashes, and nocturnal sweats. Up to now, the most effective remedy was hormone treatment, but a study of isoflavines, such as soybean, suggests it is possible to alleviate the disturbances caused by menopause. Due to this study we consider that the addition of isoflavines can provide benefits to women. Therefore, it is correct to include them in the field of medicines which give an alternative to estrogen therapy. However, one must bear in mind that data about the efficiency and security of alternative medicines in the treatment of menopause symptoms are not conclusive since each woman is unique and it is necessary to have consensus on an individualized health plan which permits one to carry out adequate therapeutic adjustments in accordance to the needs which occur over the entire menopause process.</dc:description>
