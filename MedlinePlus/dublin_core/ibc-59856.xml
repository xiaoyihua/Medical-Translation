<dc:description xml:lang="es">The most common sequele in the treatment of head and neck chemodectomas are cranial nerve lesions; of these, the most frequently affected are the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, vagus and hypoglossus nerves. The lesions of the &#147;lower cranial nerves&#148; (IX, X, XI and XII) affect the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing and frequently lead to aspiration. The frequency with which these nerves are affected varies according to several factors, being 30%in glomus vagale tumors and 20% in carotid tumors. If the V and VII cranial nerves are affected, defects in oral preparation, bolus transport and drooling may occur. Lesions of the XI and X cranial nerves are associated with delayed initiationof the pharyngeal phase, nasal reflux, dysphonia, retained secretions in the piriform sinus, and aspiration. Lesions of the XII cranial nerves affect the oral phase of swallowing. Treatment of dysphagia and aspiration will often be managed with maneuvers to aid swallowing, and changes in food bolus consistency and/or volumes. The remaining complications that can be produced are facial palsy, cerebrospinal fluid fistula, and vascular complications. Facial palsy can be produced by two mechanisms: on the one hand, by central involvement, as a complication of preoperative embolization, and on the other, by direct involvement during surgery or during occasional treatment with radiotherapy. Treatment, whether functional or cosmetic, can be provided either during surgery or subsequently to treat the sequelae of facial palsy (AU)</dc:description>
