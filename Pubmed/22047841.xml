<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this study was to identify variables that may explain a longer psychological treatment and to analyze differences between short- and long-term cases. Data from 419 patients of the University Clinic of Psychology at the Complutense University of Madrid were analyzed. Number of intervention techniques, comorbidity, previous treatments, and a primary diagnosis of mood disorder or eating disorder were the factors that explained longer treatment duration. Significant differences were observed between short- and long-term cases in number of intervention techniques, number of therapeutic objectives, and also in some clinical variables (diagnostic group, comorbidity, previous treatment) and demographics (age and educational level). Results are discussed and some lines of intervention and/ or reflection are proposed.</dc:description>
