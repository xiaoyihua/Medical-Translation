<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Hospital-based population studies are a good way to determinate the number and features of strokes that occur in a given society. The major stroke subtypes have different patterns of incidence and outcome, for that reason information on the natural history of stroke subtypes is essential. AIM To determine the incidence of the stroke subtypes and the prevalence of the major risk factors in the Spanish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS EPICES is an observational, multicenter and prospective study. Methodology includes systematic review of consecutive medical records of hospitalized stroke patients in neurological care. 6,197 patients were included during the period April 2008 and January 2009. 3,544 (57.2%) were men. Mean age was 71.4 Â± 12.8 years. RESULTS Intracerebral haemorrhage was diagnosed in 771 patients (12.4%) and ischemic stroke in 5,426 (87.6%). 1,543 (28.4%) were classified as large-artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolic 1,424 (26.2%), small-vessel occlusion 1,202 (22.5%), undetermined etiology 1,125 (20.7%). Stroke of other uncommon origin was founded in 132 (2.4%). Hypertension is the most common risk factor in both ischemic stroke (67%) and intracerebral haemorrhage (69.1%). The different types of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke showed differences in risk factors prevalence. CONCLUSIONS The overall distribution of stroke subtypes are not significantly different from those of most Western countries. The frequency of vascular risk factors differs between stroke subtypes. Hypertension remains the most important modifiable risk factor.</dc:description>
