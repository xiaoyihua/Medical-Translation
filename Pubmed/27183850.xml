<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Since its approval by the European Medicines Agency, a great number of patients born small for gestational date have received recombinant growth hormone treatment in Spain. The aim of this study is to analyse its outcome in the setting of ordinary clinical practice. METHODS Information was gathered from the registers of the assessment boards that authorise all growth hormone treatments prescribed in public hospitals in six autonomic communities (regions). RESULTS Valid data from 974 patients was obtained. All of them complied with criteria established by the European Medicines Agency. Patients in the sample were smaller in length than weight at birth, with their median target height being below 1 standard deviation (SD), and 23% of them had been delivered prematurely. Treatment was started at 7.2±2.8 years (mean±SD). The mean patient height at start was -3.1±0.8 SD. They gained 0.7±0.2 SD in the first year, and 1.2±0.8 SD after two years. Final height was attained by 8% of the sample, reaching -1.4±0.7 SD. CONCLUSIONS These results are similar to other Spanish and international published studies, and are representative of the current practice in Spain. Despite treatment being started at a late age, adequate growth is observed in the short term and in the final height. Up to a 24% of patients show a poor response in the first year.</dc:description>
