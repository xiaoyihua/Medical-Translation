<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE This study has aimed to analyze the changes observed in the lipid profile and atherogenic risk in prostate cancer patients subjected to androgen deprivation. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2001 and 2008, serum lipoproteins (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides) were determined in 636 patients. Of these, 129 were treated with maximum androgen blockade and 177 patients were only treated with LHRH analogue. The control group was formed by 339 subjected to prostate biopsy (212 with prostate cancer and 127 without prostate cancer). The atherogenic risk was calculated using the Castelli formula (total cholesterol/HDL). RESULTS Mean atherogenic risk was 4.2 in the control group and 4 in the group of patients subjected to androgenic deprivation, p&gt;0.05. The mean atherogenic risk in those subjected to monotherapy with LHRH analogues was 4.1 while it was 3.9 in patients subjected to maximal androgen blockade, p=0.02. We did not found significant differences for atherogenic risk according to length of treatment, p&gt;0.05. The multivariate analysis confirmed that the treatment modality was the only significant variable influencing atherogenic risk. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that continuous androgen deprivation does not increase atherogenic risk in patients with prostate cancer. This risk also did not increase during the treatment. The association of bicalutamide to the LHRH analogue seems to have a protective effect on atherogenic risk.</dc:description>
