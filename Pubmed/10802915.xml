<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The correlation between leukocytospermia and genital infections remains controversial. Similarly, it is inaccurate to consider the increase of round cells (RC) in semen as leukocytospermia. The purpose of this study was to determine the possible association between round cells, leukocystospermia and bacterial infections in infertile patients. METHODS 410 semen samples were analyzed to determine sperm concentration, motility, morphology and round cells according to standard WHO citeria. Immature germ cells were differentiated by the Papanicolau stain, while the Nahoum-Cardozo method was used for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Bacteriological studies in semen first urine sprout and urethral secretion were performed. Gram-Nicolle stain was utilized for the direct examination. Cultures were made in enriched blood Columbia agar and Thayer Martin agar was used for common germs. For mycoplasma identification, both A7 Sheppard solid and liquid media were used. Presence of Chlamydia trachomatis in urethral secretion was investigated by direct immunofluorescence. RESULTS 79% (324) of the samples were dispermic, 9.02% presented more than 10(6) RC/ml. Of these, only 29.7% (11) presented leukocytospermia. Spearman's ranked correlation, used to measure association between RC/field and PMN leukocytes/ml, showed a value of 0.2705 with an associated probability of 0.1046, indicating a non-significant association between variables. Bacteriological studies performed in 32 samples showed 13 were positive, but only 4 (30.7%) presented leukocytospermia. Of the 19 samples with negative bacteriology, 15.78% were leukocytospermic. There was no statistically significant correlation between increased RC and the presence of germs (chi 2: 0.14965, p &lt; 0.05) or between PMN and germs (chi 2: 1.01390, p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS These data suggest the convenience of performing bacteriological studies in semen in spite of the presence of RC in the direct examination.</dc:description>
