<dc:description xml:lang="en">A random sample of thirty families containing a member with a bipolar disorder were interviewed by a psychiatrist and two clinical psychologists with training in family evaluations and therapy. During the interview the family was given the task of discussing the possible causes of the patient's illness and to consider specific steps to help prevent relapses. The raters independently scored the Beavers Timberlawn Family Evaluation Scale and the Family Response to the Illness Scale. The patients were also evaluated using the Social Support Network Inventory, and a number of clinical and demographic indicators were routinely recorded. The research team showed good interrater reliability with the instruments, and evidence of validity is presented for the FRIS. A Cluster Analysis was performed and a two clusters solution was found. The first cluster contained twelve patients and the second is composed of eighteen patients. The clusters seem to differentiate patients along clinical outcome measures, drug compliance and cultural background. Family variables related to the structural dimensions of the system were found to cut across both clusters. Family variables measuring empathy, affect and expression of feelings were found to predict medication compliance and clinical outcome. The findings are discussed in the light of the concept of underorganization of family structures.</dc:description>
