<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE As the research undertaken to date on the efficacy of the new antibiotics in the treatment of exacerbations of chronic bronchitis has taken the form of trials designed to demonstrate equivalence, we have no data on the advantages associated with the use of these new drugs with greater bactericidal activity. Our objective was to compare the clinical efficacy of moxifloxacin to that of the antibiotic regimens routinely used to treat such exacerbations by a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis. METHODS A manual and electronic search was performed to identify all clinical trials carried out between January 1997 and July 2005 to compare moxifloxacin and the antibiotics that are currently the first line treatment for exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Once it had been established that the designs of the trials included were acceptable, a meta-analysis of clinical outcomes was performed. RESULTS Of the 45 studies identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 5 were double-blind randomized trials and 4 were randomized open trials. The 9 trials comprised a total of 3905 patients. The aggregate standardized mean difference in clinical success rate was 1.5% (95% confidence interval, -0.4 to 3.4%). Bacterial eradication rates ranged from 68.4% to 96% for the standard regimens, and from 87.7% to 96% for moxifloxacin. No intergroup differences in the percentages of patients lost to follow-up were observed in any of the studies. CONCLUSIONS Although the trials reviewed were designed to demonstrate equivalence, meta-analysis revealed that the clinical success rate achieved with moxifloxacin tended to be higher than that obtained in the groups that received standard antibiotic treatment.</dc:description>
