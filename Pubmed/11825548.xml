<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Our main objective was to determine growth retardation in children entering a foster home and catch-up growth at the end of the stay. We also analyzed the nutritional status and its relationship with growth retardation. SUBJECTS AND METHOD Height and weight were determined in 118 children, aged between one month and fifteen years; they were examined at admission and at the time of leaving the center. In another group of 31 prepubertal children, we analized their nutritional status determining the body mass index, prealbumin, retinol binding protein, GHBP, IGF-1, IGFBP-3 and leptin at admission. RESULTS 31 (26.2%) out of the of the 118 children group had a height deficit (height &lt; 2 SDS) at admission. 32 (27.1%) of the overall group of children showed significant catch-up growth after their stay at the foster home, and 15 (46.8%) of them showed a catch-up growth &gt; 0.5 SDS. Children below two years of age showed the most important growth deficit. The nutritional status study showed normal results in all parameters in the 31 children group. Significant correlations were observed between IGF-I and weight/height, IGFBP-3 and weight/height, GHBP and body mass index, and leptin and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS An important proportion of children showed significant growth retardation at entering a foster home, although a significant catch-up growth was observed at the end of their stay. Growth failure in this population does not appear to be related to the nutritional status.</dc:description>
