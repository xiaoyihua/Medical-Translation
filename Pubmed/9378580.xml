<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To study the return to paid work between the 5th and 12th month after the birth of a child depending on socioeconomic and occupational characteristics of employed mothers. Furthermore, to analyse the differences at the time of returning to work (5th or 12th month) according to these characteristics. METHODS Longitudinal study carried out on a sample of 528 primiparous or secundiparous women who have had a child in a public hospital in the city of Valencia and who have carried out a professional activity during pregnancy. Three cross-sectional cut off points were made; the first two days after childbirth, the second five months later and the third a year after the child was born. The information collection was conducted by means of a questionnaire. Uni and multivariate statistical analysis techniques have been used. RESULTS Five months after childbirth the probability of returning to work was greater in women who worked with permanent contracts in the private sector (ORadjusted: 7.4) or public sector (ORadjusted: 7.8). Likewise it is higher in service workers (ORadjusted: 2.0), administrative staff (ORadjusted: 2.5) and professionals or technical workers (ORadjusted: 2.9). The probability of returning to paid work a year after childbirth is higher in the mother who works in the public sector with permanent or temporary contracts (ORadjusted: 21.0 and 5.1 respectively) and in the private sector with permanent contracts (ORadjusted: 5.1). It is also higher in service workers (ORadjusted: 2.2), in administrative staff (ORadjusted: 2.7) and professionals or technical workers (ORadjusted: 4.7). CONCLUSIONS Childbirth may lead to a break in the working career of the woman. The socio-demographic and professional factors which might explain this break are low professional qualifications and unstable employment in private sector companies.</dc:description>
