<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Calcitonin is specially indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in women that cannot receive estrogen replacement therapy or that have a high bone turnover rate. AIM To study the effects of low intranasal calcitonin doses on bone remodeling in postmenopausal women with a high bone turnover. PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty one healthy women aged 56 +/- 6 years old, with a mean lapse after menopause of 7.6 +/- 6.5 years and with a high bone turnover rate, evidenced by an urinary hydroxyproline (mg/dl)/creatinine (g/dl) ratio of 52.4 +/- 7.2, were studied. They were randomly assigned to receive 100 or 50 U/calcitonin thrice a week during 3 months or to a control group that received placebo. All received 500 mg/day calcium carbonate. Urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio was measured a 0, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days. Plasma bone fraction of alkanine phosphatases was measured at 0, 30 and 90 days. RESULTS Initial urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio and plasma bone fraction of alkanine phosphatases were similar in all study groups and there was no change in these parameters during the study period. CONCLUSIONS Intranasal calcitonin in doses of 100 U thrice a week or less, does not modify accelerated bone turnover in postmenopausal women.</dc:description>
