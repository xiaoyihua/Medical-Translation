<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE We aimed yo assess whether an educational intervention on the use of inhalational devices improve the functional status of patients with COPD. PATIENTS AND METHOD Randomized controlled trial with parallel design and simple blind trial performed in a clinic with 94 patients diagnosed with COPD and who used inhaled devices. Participants were randomized into 2 groups: the intervention group held a training session on the use of inhalers at baseline and one month and strengthening the control group with routine monitoring. The main outcome measure was the change in the synthetic index BODE (Body-Mass Index, Airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exercise Capacity). RESULTS Patients in the intervention group (n=48) experienced an improvement in the sensation of breathlessness decreasing by 0.85 points (95% CI -1.14 to -0.56) on the MMRC dyspnea scale, while the control group (n=46) did not show any significant change p&lt;0.0001. On the walking test the intervention group walked 6.19 meters (95% CI -4.02 to 16.40) while the control group walked 20.55 meters lower (95% CI -37.80 to -3.28), significant differences with p=0.009. The BODE index decreased (improved) -0.82 points in the intervention group (95% CI -1.16 to -0.46) and increased (worsened) 0.20 in control group (95% CI -0.16 to 0.56) p&lt;0.0001. CONCLUSIONS Patients with COPD who receive specific training on inhaler use as compared with those with regular monitoring experience improvement in their functional state.</dc:description>
