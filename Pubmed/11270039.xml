<dc:description xml:lang="en">We review non-invasive fungal sinusitis (FS) cases treated at our Unit following the recent SF classification, based on physiopathology, treatment and prognosis. We report 7 FS cases treated during 2 years and followed a minimum of 24 months. They are two allergic FS, one of them related to an allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and five mycetomas, two of them without a sinusal foreign body, sphenoidal and maxillary respectively, and three caused by a maxillary foreign body. All were treated by endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). The two allergic cases were also treated with systemic corticoids in the postoperative period. We review the clinical presentation of the different types of non-invasive FS, the importance of endoscopy and imaging techniques in their management, the usefulness of ESS, the common association of FS to foreign bodies, and their prognosis.</dc:description>
