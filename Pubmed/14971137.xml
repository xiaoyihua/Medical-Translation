<dc:description xml:lang="en">We review patients operated of parotidectomy in our ENT department of Dr. Peset Hospital from Valencia during the period 1975-2001. We sheltered an amount of 147 cases. The pathologic distribution between benign and malign tumors was as following: 121 benign tumors (83%) and 26 malign tumors (17%). Here we study malign parotid tumors, which represent 17% of total parotid tumors. Sensibility and specificity of FNA was 54% and 96.5% respectively. We performed almost with similar frequencies total and suprafacial parotidectomies in 46% and 42% of cases respectively. Total parotidectomy with facial resection is indicated in cases with tumor nerve infiltration and has been done in 8% of cases. The main complications of surgery were facial nerve dysfunction and Frey syndrome. Permanent facial nerve dysfunction and and transitory facial nerve disfunction occurred in 3.8% and 30.8% of patients respectively. Frey syndrome appeared in 10% of patients operated of parotidectomy. Recurrences occurred in 15.4% of patients.</dc:description>
