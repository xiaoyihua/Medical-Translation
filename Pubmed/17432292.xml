<dc:description xml:lang="en">Clinical case. This 27 year-old male was referred admitted with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) after heavy consumption of alcohol and sepsis (bacteremia and multilobar pneumonia) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); he required mechanical ventilation and haemodyalisis, and developed fungemia by fluconazol-resistant Candida albicans. He was treated with caspofungin for 20 days and vancomycin for six weeks, and he was discharged after 51 days of hospitalization. This case shows the painful evolution of a patient admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with MRSA sepsis. According to the National Nosocomial Infections Study (USA), S. aureus is the cause of up to 35% of hospital-acquired pneumonia and bacteremia. Using molecular tools (e.g. pulse gel electrophoresis), different families of MRSA have been well described. Use of i.v. catheters, long-term hospitalization, surgery and previous use of antimicrobials are considered major risk factors for MRSA. In Mexico, Alpuche-Aranda, et al (1986) reported a prevalence of 5% in a pediatric hospital. However, a recent report from the National Resistance Network showed a MRSA prevalence of 36% in 2004. In this institution, we observed a rate of MRSA of 100% in the ICU during 2005. This case shows an episode of SAP after heavy alcohol consumption, complicated with severe infections such as candidemia and MRSA sepsis; fortunately he had a favorable outcome after a multidisciplinary and aggressive approach. This case fulfilled all the risk factors for an MRSA infection, in a setting with a very high rate of methicillin-resistance, which compels the medical community to implement adequate and efficacious epidemiological control measures.</dc:description>
