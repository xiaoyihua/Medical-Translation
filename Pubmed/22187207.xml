<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To validate the rating (assessment) scale for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (EDAH) in Canarian population of primary education. SUBJECTS AND METHODS From a sample of 2,500 children, you get a subsample with those participants who have a higher scores at 75 percentile in each of the factors that make up the test (n = 614), of which 222 are girls (36.2 %) and 392 boys (63.8 %). With regard to the age, the rank ranges between 6 and 12 years. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Factorial analysis with Varimax rotation obtained as the main factor resulting in the emergence of social interaction problems such as in the validation performed for teens population, keeping the three factors of the original test, although with some differences in their composition. It also had a high internal consistency by Cronbach alpha coefficient (0.86) which confirms the reliability of the scale. In terms of demographics variables analyzed, the variable number of failures significantly explains the variance of all factors that make up the scale, being the only significant variable in the factor of attention deficit and problems with social interaction. The sex variable is significant in the factor behavior problems and hyperactivity whereas age is only in the hyperactivity factor.</dc:description>
