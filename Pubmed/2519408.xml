<dc:description xml:lang="en">Several risk factors were studied in regard to congenital malformations. Malformed newborns (n = 1200) and controls (n = 1200) seen at the Universidad de Chile Hospital between 1969 and 1979 were examined. Their mothers were asked about possible risk factors. Parenteral age and birth order was significantly higher for malformed newborns than for controls. A family history of congenital malformations was more frequent in malformed newborns. Infertility, metrorrhagia and maternal diseases during pregnancy were more frequent in malformed newborns than in controls. A function that discriminates between controls mothers and mothers of malformed newborns was obtained by a logistic regression model. This function correctly predicted 65% of cases.</dc:description>
