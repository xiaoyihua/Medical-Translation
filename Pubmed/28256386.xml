<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the reliability of the interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECG) by general practitioners and those in training by making a comparison with the interpretation made by the cardiologist. MATERIAL AND METHODS An observational study was conducted that included general practitioners working in the Toledo Health Area, physicians during their training in Family and Community Medicine, and cardiologists in their first 3 years of specialist training (R1-R3). A questionnaire was used that included 13 ECGs with no clinical details of the patient. The 13 ECGs were selected and their diagnoses made by consensus by 2 cardiologists from the Toledo Hospital Complex. RESULTS The highest percentage of correct answers (82.3%) was obtained for ECG 5 (atrial fibrillation), and the lowest (26.5%) for ECG 11 (junctional rhythm). The highest diagnostic skill was achieved by the resident cardiologists, general practitioners, medical tutors, and doctors who had worked in hospital emergency departments. The highest odds ratio for a higher diagnostic skill was to work in an emergency department and be a practising general practitioner, both with almost significant results (P&lt;.10). CONCLUSIONS Family physicians and those in training have a medium level of reliability in the interpretation of an ECG compared to the cardiologist.</dc:description>
