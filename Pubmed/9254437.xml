<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence and severity of dental caries and the dental treatment necessities of school children in Mexico City. The studied population was surveyed for dental caries in 1988 to obtain data necessary for the National Program of Salt Fluoridation in Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS The population was selected with a sample frame based on a list of Kindergartens and primary schools registered at the Ministry of Public Education in 1988. The oral cavity examination was based on diagnostic criteria marked by the World Health Organization. RESULTS A total of 4475 scholars of 5 to 12 years of age were included in the study. Dental caries prevalence in the population reached 90.5%. The index of treatment necessities was high (79.6%). The mean of caries index in scholars of 12 years of age was DMFT = 4.42 (SD = 3.2) and DMFS = 6.53 (SD = 4.8). CONCLUSIONS Results emphasize the pertinence of a widely reaching preventive program of such as salt fluoridation. Additionally, strategies to improve access of the school children population to dental services must be elaborated.</dc:description>
