<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective was to describe the epidemiology of preeclampsia-eclampsia (P-E) at the Hospital General O'Horán (HGOH) in Mérida, Yucatán, México, from 1995 to 1998. Patients with a discharge diagnosis of P-E were included. Their demographic and clinical data were ascertained. To analyze information, descriptive statistics were used. There were 143 patients. Preeclampsia was documented in 41% and eclampsia in 59%. The mean age of the group was 24.4 +/- 7.3 years. It was found that 76% came from rural area. In 79% schooling was no more than elementary education. Seventy five per cent were married. Sexual life began at a mean age of 18.8 +/- 4.3 years. There was no prenatal care in 27% of the cases. Fifty five per cent were primigravida and 43% multigravida. Nuliparity was documented in 52%. Two o more parities were documented in 48%. Complications were seen in 30%. Overall mortality rate was 5%, more frequent eclamptic patients. At the HGOH, P-E was frequently documented in women with both low socioeconomic status and fewer years of schooling. Prenatal care was also irregular. Clinical evolution was satisfactory in most of them, and the mortality rate was low, although it usually occurred in young eclamptic women.</dc:description>
