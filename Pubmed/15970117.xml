<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. It has been shown that IL-10 is released into the circulation during post-ischemic myocardial reperfusion. The objective of this study was to determine whether the serum IL-10 concentration in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were undergoing primary angioplasty was related to the subsequent presence or absence of heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHOD The study included 65 patients who underwent successful primary angioplasty. During their subsequent stay in the coronary unit, their maximum degree of heart failure was recorded. Patients were then divided into 2 groups: group A patients were in Killip class I and group B patients in Killip classes II-IV. The serum IL-10 concentration was measured during the 24 hours following admission to the coronary unit. RESULTS The 2 groups were similar with regard to age, sex, and coronary risk factors. The IL-10 concentration was significantly higher in the group of patients with acute myocardial infarction without heart failure than in the group with heart failure (30.4+/-10.8 vs 19.8+/-7.9 pg/mL; P&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute myocardial infarction who had undergone successful primary angioplasty, the serum IL-10 concentration measured during the following 24 hours was significantly higher in those who did not develop heart failure. These findings suggest that this anti-inflammatory cytokine has a protective effect on the myocardium during ischemia or reperfusion, or both.</dc:description>
