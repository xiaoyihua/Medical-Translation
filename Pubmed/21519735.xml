<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Nutrition labelling (NL) provides information on the energy and nutrients in a food and it represents a valuable tool to help consumers make informed decisions about their diet and lifestyle. However, little is known about how consumers perceive the nutrition labelling information. OBJECTIVES Evaluate the knowledge of NL of a population survey and examine aspects such as attention, reading, understanding and utility. MATERIAL AND METHODS 200 volunteers were interviewed about NL on National Nutrition Day (NND) on May 28, 2010 at the La Paz University Hospital in Madrid. The questionnaire was self-administered and this contained 10 closed multiple choice questions. RESULTS The surveyed group (66.7% women and 33.3% men) had a mean age of 42.0 ± 15 years and a BMI of 24.1 ± 3.8 kg/m². A percentage of 86.5% had completed secondary and higher education. The concept about NL was knocked by 77.1% of them. This percentage was significantly higher according to the level of their studies (primary 7.1%, secondary 32.1% and higher studies 60.9%; p &lt; 0.0001) and also regarding the age range (42.3% vs. 25% of over that 50, p &lt; 0.05). 73.8% always or almost always readied NL; 67.7% of those who declared that always readied were women and 71% had higher education. 53.8% of people over 50 years were not capable of reading labels due to the small letters. The most interesting information for the consumers was: calories (61%), fats (39%) and cholesterol (25.7%). Nutritional concepts questions had a low percentage of right answers, especially in volunteers with lower level of education and among older age groups. CONCLUSIONS Results show that consumers have a low level of nutrition information that would enable a better choice to purchase food. Nutrition education is needed should be necessary to NL had a significant impact on the foods election. Therefore, this fact could contribute to the maintenance of health and disease prevention.</dc:description>
