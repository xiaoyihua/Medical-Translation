<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Asthma is one of the more prevalent diseases in childhood. Geographical differences have been found but it is unknown if they are true or are a consequence of the different methods used in the study of asthma. POPULATION AND METHODS In 9 Spanish populations: Almería, Barcelona, Bilbao, Bahía de Cádiz, Cartagena, Castellón, Pamplona, Valencia and Valladolid, 27,407 children aged 13-14 years were interviewed using the asthma written and video questionnaires of the ISAAC protocol. Comparisons among geographical areas were performed using a cluster analysis and a Poisson regression model adjusting by gender. RESULTS The prevalence of resting wheezing using the video questionnaire was higher in males than in females (15.4% versus 12.6%) for wheezing ever. In the last year the prevalence of wheezing was 7.8% in males versus 7.0% in females. The analysis shows a group of centers with low prevalence of asthma symptoms: Valladolid, Almería, Castellón and Pamplona. Nevertheless there are also centers with higher prevalences as Bilbao, Barcelona and Bahía de Cádiz. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of asthma and asthmatic symptoms is high in Spanish children aged 13-14 years. There are true geographical differences in Spain, being Valladolid, Almería, Castellón and Pamplona the areas with lowest prevalence.</dc:description>
