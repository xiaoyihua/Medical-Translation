<dc:description xml:lang="en">The present study originated because of the importance and current interest in fat intake and its relationship with cardiovascular diseases. The quality and quantity of fat intake is studied in the Spanish population as a whole, as well as in each of the Autonomic Communities. The quality of the ingested fat is analyzed considering the intake of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids using different index such as: polyunsaturated/saturated ratio (P/S), Keys, Anderson and Grande's index, and vegetable fat + fish fat/animal fat--fish fat ratio. The differences found according to the geographical localization of the Autonomic Community were studied, finding the influence of what is known as the "Mediterranean diet".</dc:description>
