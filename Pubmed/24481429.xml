<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To compare the lifestyle and metabolic control of diabetes patients included and not included in the DiabetIMSS program. METHODS Subjects with diabetes in the DiabetIMSS program and the general clinic were divided into three groups: group 1 first attended the program, group 2 were enrolled during the study, and group 3 had not been included the program. Demographic and clinical aspects were measured and the IMEVID instrument was applied. RESULTS We included 539 type-2 diabetes patients, predominantly females (73.3%), mainly of primary school level, and more frequently on double-drug therapy. There were clinical differences between the three groups for program leavers in terms of weight, waist, blood pressure, fasting glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides, and IMEVID qualification, all p &lt; 0.05; correlation analysis of the variables with the qualification of IMEVID was significant at p &lt; 0.05. The higher number of variable control targets was for leavers (71% of group); those who were enrolled in the study was 32%, and who had not was 17.2%. CONCLUSIONS There are significant differences in lifestyle and control target parameters in subjects who completed the DiabetIMSS program.</dc:description>
