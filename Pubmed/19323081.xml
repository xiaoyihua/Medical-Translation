<dc:description xml:lang="en">Nonparasitic splenic cysts are a disease of very low incidence, although the availability of ecography and the indication of the preservative treatment of the splenic traumas are becoming it less infrequent. We report our experience with 6 patients, 4 girls and 2 boys, between 9- and 14-years-old. The reason was attended: 4 had abdominal pain, one of them underwent a traumatism and the other one was an accidental finding. The ultrasound gave us the diagnosis in all patients. The CT (computer tomography) and MR (magnetic resonance) added a few interesting details. All of them were operated, 4 with laparotomy and 2 with laparoscopy that we turned to laparotomy, one of them by suspicion of large hidatidic cyst and the other one by external aspect of solid tumour. The histological results were 4 epidermoid cysts, a simple cyst and a lymphangioma. After our experience we considered that ecography is a sufficient diagnosis method, like surgical treatment, the access and the technique vary according to the location of the cyst, the amount of splenic parenchyma around it and their macroscopic characteristics. The more superficial cysts, less wall thickness and location polar have the indication of laparoscopic partial decapsulation.</dc:description>
