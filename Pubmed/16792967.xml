<dc:description xml:lang="en">Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS-1) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, autoimmune hypoparathyroidism, and primary adrenal insufficiency. It has recently been associated with mutations of a single gene found on chromosome 21, designated AutoImmune Regulator (AIRE). We report two patients with APS-1 referred to our hospital for evaluation. The first patient was an 11-year-old girl with hypoparathyroidism, infectious or immunological malabsorption, and autoimmune hepatitis. Hypoparathyroidism associated with other processes with a probable autoimmune origin suggested APS-1. Genetic study was performed revealing deletion of 13 base pairs in exon 8 of the AIRE gene. The second patient was a 17-year-old girl with autoimmune hepatitis, hypoparathyroidism, mucocutaneous candidiasis, nail dystrophy, and obliterating bronchiolitis with a probable autoimmune origin. We suspected APS-1 and genetic study was performed. The only finding was an AIRE gene polymorphism. In conclusion, the presence of a single disease criterion is sufficient to suspect APS-1 and to indicate genetic study. Further studies are required to confirm the involvement of other genes in the development of this disease.</dc:description>
