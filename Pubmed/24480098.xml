<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Previous studies in Spain have shown that the foreign and immigrant populations can have different diseases to Spanish-born individuals. However, no comparative study has specifically investigated foreign children in Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS The objective of the study was to compare skin diseases in foreign children with those in children born in Spain of Spanish parents. We included all patients under 15 years of age who were seen in our dermatology department between January 2007 and December 2007. RESULTS During the study period, 3108 pediatric patients were seen in the dermatology department. Of these, 2661 (85.6%) were Spanish and 447 (14.3%) were foreigners. Foreign children sought medical care more often (11.4%) than Spanish children (6%) (P&lt;.001) and made less use of the specialist outpatient clinic (59.6% vs 68.8% [P&lt;.001]) and more use of emergency care. Complaints observed more frequently in the foreign children were scabies (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 10.6; 95% CI, 4.71-24.10), arthropod bites (aOR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.14-6.87), hypopigmentation (aOR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.06-6.44), and atopic dermatitis (aOR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.19-2.31). Melanocytic nevus was observed more frequently in Spanish children (aOR, .50; 95% CI, .30-.83). CONCLUSIONS Differences between children born in Spain of Spanish parents and foreign children were found for type of visit and frequency of skin diseases.</dc:description>
