<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Urinary incontinence (UI) has been poorly studied in Spanish nursing homes. The objective is to determine the prevalence and related factors of UI in institutionalized older people in Madrid, Spain. METHODS A probabilistic sample of 754 subjects 65 years of age and older living in public and private institutions in Madrid was randomly selected through stratified cluster sampling. Residents, caregivers and physicians were interviewed. UI was defined as any leakage in the previous 14 days. We asked about the frequency (occasional, nocturnal, frequent and total), quantity (drops or small quantities, very much), and types (urge, stress, due to cognitive impairment, and due to walking difficulty). To determine the factors associated with UI, we built logistic regression models that adjusted for age, sex, functional dependency (Barthel index) and cognitive status (Pfeiffer's test). RESULTS The prevalence of UI was 53.6%. Of all residents 35.8% had frequent or total UI. Among those incontinent 60.1% had a very large quantity of urine loss and the most common presentation was mixed (54.1%). The most frequent type in the population was urgent UI (26.8%) followed by UI due to walking difficulty (21.4%). UI was associated (odds ratios [95% CI]) with moderate (3.51 [1.56-7.89]) and severe functional disability (44.71 [10.99-181.94]), faecal incontinence (4.97 [2.04-12.16]), stroke (4.59 [1.06-19.87]), physical restraints (4.03 [1.02-17.87]), and falls (2.10 [1.16-3.81]). The mean (95% CI) number of pads used per person per day was 3.0 (2.4-3.6). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of UI was somewhat higher than that of other comparable populations. Mixed forms, including functional types, were common.</dc:description>
