<dc:title xml:lang="en">Pathogenesis of oral cancer for human papiloma virus</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Introduction: Oral cancer represents 1-2% of all cancer in the organism, 90% corresponding to oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). Risk factors traditionally involved in the development of oral cancer are advanced age, male sex, and prolonged exposure to habits such as alcohol, tobacco, and betel nut. The increase in the incidence of OSCC in young patients without exposure to classical risk factors in recent years has revealed the presence of other possible etiopathogenic agents, especially the human Papilloma Virus (hPV). Objectives: Describe the molecular development of the OSCC by the hPV intervention as oncovirus and its characteristics. Results: Different studies show the high oncogenic risk of hPV 16 and 18 subtypes acting through their E6 and E7 proteins, directly affecting p53, Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and other enzymes involved in the regulation of the cycle Cell as the PI3K, altering the processes of apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation. Conclusions:  hPV plays an important role as a carcinogen in the onset of OSCC, with a more favorable prognosis regarding other etiological factors. The process of oncogenesis in the development of COCE from hPV is determined by the high risk subtypes as well as the expression of the viral proteins E6 and E7 responsible for inhibiting the activity of the cell cycle tumor suppressor genes (AU)</dc:description>
