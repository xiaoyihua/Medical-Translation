<dc:description xml:lang="en">The genotoxicity of environmental complex mixtures was tested with Ames mutagenicity assay and with Bacillus subtilis rec assay for estimation of primary DNA damage. Soil samples obtained from an area contaminated with petrochemical wastes were sequentially extracted with ethyl ether and methanol. After evaporation to dryness the extracts were resuspended in dimethylsulfoxide for their use in biological tests. No mutagenic response was detected with the Ames test. Ether extract from parcel 1 showed an unusually high toxicity for Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and induced DNA damage in Bacillus subtilis with a clear relationship dose-genotoxic response. The analysis of the results obtained in both assays and the nature of the samples indicate that the genotoxicity detected in the complex mixture is compatible with the one caused by DNA intercalating compounds.</dc:description>
