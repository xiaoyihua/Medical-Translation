<dc:description xml:lang="en">Nineteen patients with pneumonia caused by Legionella, who did not need to be admitted to ICU were treated with 500 mg/day of azithromycin. The etiological diagnosis was made retrospectively by detecting Legionella pneumophila in the urine of nine patients and/or by serology (seroconversion or single titer 1/256) in 19 cases. None of them met the criteria for ICU admittance nor had received prior treatment with antibiotics which were potentially active against L. pneumophila. Serology tests and radiography of the thorax were carried out on all the patients in the study during their convalescence period. The average age (+/- SD) of the group was 58.5 +/- 16.2 years. The average respiratory frequency (+/- SD) 26 +/- 6 breaths per minute; the radiologic extension was of one lobule in 18 cases and two lobules in one case. No patients showed bilateral disease. Arterial gasometry (FiO2 0.21) showed a pO2 average of (+/- SD) 53 +/- 14 mmHg and the hemogram an average of 6.700 leukocytes/mm3 (range: 4,200-41-800). All the patients progressed favorably. The average duration of fever was 1.8 days; the average stay (+/- SD) was 6.1 +/- 2 days. The treatment was well tolerated. One month after discharge radiographies were clear for all patients. There were no relapses. In conclusion, 3-day administration of azithromycin was found to be a useful guide in the treatment of community acquired pneumonia caused by Legionella in patients whose clinical situation does not require ICU administration and allows for oral administration.</dc:description>
