<dc:description xml:lang="en">Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a very distressing condition that not only negatively affects the elderly man's sexual ability, but also his overall quality of life and that of his partner. Encouraging men, alone or as a couple, to seek professional help is a major educational challenge which needs to be met by medical, social and political initiatives. The exact pathogenesis of ED remains unknown, but is presumed to be multifactorial; vascular disease is the most frequent cause with endothelial dysfunction being the common denominator. It has been postulated that ED is a sentinel symptom of cardiovascular clinical events and should prompt investigation and intervention for cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, when a patient presents with ED, a thorough history and physical examination should be performed, as well as appropriate laboratory tests aimed at detecting associated diseases.</dc:description>
