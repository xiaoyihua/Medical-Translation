<dc:description xml:lang="en">Lung transplantation is a therapeutic option for pulmonary diseases in which the other treatment options have failed or in cases of rapid disease progression. However, transplantation is not free from complications, and primary graft dysfunction is one of them. Primary graft dysfunction is a form of acute lung injury. It characteristically develops during the immediate postoperative period, being associated to high morbidity and mortality, and increased risk of bronchiolitis obliterans. Different terms have been used in reference to primary graft dysfunction, leading to a consensus document to clarify the definition in 2005. This consensus document regards primary graft dysfunction as non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema developing within 72 hours of reperfusion and intrinsically attributable to alteration of the lung parenchyma. A number of studies have attempted to identify risk factors and to establish the underlying physiopathology, with a view to developing potential therapeutic options. Such options include nitric oxide and pulmonary surfactant together with supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation or oxygenation bypass.</dc:description>
