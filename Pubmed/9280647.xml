<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Patients with ictus spend a long time in hospital. This is partly to the fact that it is a severe condition. In which complications frequently develop, in elderly patients with social problems due to their subsequent disability. Also this prolonged hospital stay may be the result of misconceptions as to the object of hospitalization in cases of stroke. DEVELOPMENT Whether to admit to hospital for stroke depends on the type of hospital, availability of other centres for chronic cara and the existence of satisfactory social services. During the acute phase of the illness, medical and neurological stability of the process is necessary together with minimization of cerebral damage. Hospital stay may be prolonged to study other secondary medical conditions and because of the uncertain prognosis using evolutionary criteria. This cases additional medical complications in these patients. Findings of the 'Grupo de Estudio de Enfermedades Cerebrovasculares de la SEN', show that prolonged hospital stay in cases of intracerebral haemorrhage cannot be justified by either the severity of the clinical picture, the mortality whilst in hospital or the functional capacity of the patient. CONCLUSION The objectives of hospitalization in cases of ictus must be defined to optimize care, reduce complications and improve use of health care resources.</dc:description>
