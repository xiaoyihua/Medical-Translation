<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To quantify the impact factor of Anales Españoles de Pediatría from 1997 until 2000 and to identify the journal's citation patterns and the topics with the greatest impact. METHODS SCISEARCH was used to locate citations of articles published in Anales Españoles de Pediatría between 1995 and 1999. The following data were collected for each article: year of publication, authors, journal, country of publication, language, specialty or specialties, institution(s), residence of the first author and topic. The impact factor was calculated as the ratio between citations received over 1 year by articles published in Anales Españoles de Pediatría in the two previous years and the total number of articles published by Anales Españoles de Pediatría over the 2 years under study. RESULTS The impact factor of Anales Españoles de Pediatría was 0.052 in 1997, 0.080 in 1998, 0.101 in 1999, 0.089 in 2000 and 0.064 in 2001. Citations were found in a wide range of source journals. The greatest proportion (35.6 %) were found in Spanish medical journals. Citations were made mainly by Spanish authors (62.8 %) and self-citation was moderate (14.3 %). Topics related to neurology (16.9 % of the citations received), infectious diseases (16.2 %) and neonatology (14.8 %) had the greatest impact. CONCLUSION The impact factor of Anales Españoles de Pediatria is modest, although higher than that of some other biomedical publications included in Journal Citation Reports.</dc:description>
