<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION We present a retrospective observation study aimed at analyzing the value of plasmapheresis in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other acute demyelinating processes affecting the central nervous system (CNS) who show severe exacerbations that do not respond well to conventional therapy with corticoids. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 11 patients were included in the study: nine with MS, one disseminated acute encephalomyelitis and one case of transverse myelitis. All of them presented an acute or subacute neurological deficit, which prevented them from carrying out their day to day activities, with or without repercussions on the EDSS, and with the risk of suffering a severe residual disability after not responding to intravenous methylprednisolone pulses. Each patient was submitted to three exchanges per week, for 2 weeks, with association of orally administered prednisone and they were then evaluated after the last session and at one, six and twelve months. RESULTS Following plasmapheresis all the patients experienced a significant drop in disability and seven of them (77.7% of the total number with MS) even improved during the first month with respect to their basal situation ( an extension of the Lazarus effect ). After a year s follow up, 100% of the patients still maintained the basal situation that was recovered from before exacerbation, and only two relapses were recorded. The patients with MS presented a transient exacerbation after the second exchange. New therapy with immunosuppressants, immunomodulators or both was associated in eight cases. CONCLUSIONS We consider plasmapheresis to be a safe, effective therapeutic procedure in the management of patients with MS and other demyelinating processes affecting the CNS. Its use should be considered as first choice in severe relapses and in swiftly progressing forms that do not respond to intravenous methylprednisolone.</dc:description>
