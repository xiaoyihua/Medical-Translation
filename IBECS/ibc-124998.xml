<dc:description xml:lang="es">Capillary electrophoresis of serum proteins is the method most currently used by clinical laboratories for the detection of monoclonal components in serum due to it being highly automated and rapid, with a high sensitivity, signi&amp;#64257;cantly improving the results compared to methods based on the use of gel techniques. However, there have been reports of interference by exogenous, non-protein substances that absorb at the same wavelength and cause false positives. Blood samples for laboratory analysis, including protein electrophoresis, were taken from two patients just after they had been subjected to a computed tomography (CT) scan with iodinated contrast. A monoclonal peak was observed in the beta fraction of the electrophoresis  pattern, which was unable to be con&amp;#64257;rmed by immuno&amp;#64257;xation or immunosubtraction, leading to the suspicion of interference by iodinated contrast. A second sample was requested in bothcases to repeat the analysis, which showed the disappearance of the peak, with a totally normal electrophoretic pro&amp;#64257;le being obtained (AU)</dc:description>
