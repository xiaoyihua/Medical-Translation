<dc:description xml:lang="en">Urolithiasis is a common disease with increasing prevalence worldwide and a lifetimeestimated recurrence risk of over 50%. Imaging techniques play a critical role in the initial diagnosis, follow-up and urological management of urinary tract stone disease. The are many useful tools for diagnosing urolithiasis, including conventional plain radiography, intravenous urography, ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. All these techniques have their own individual roles to play and also their limitations. Radiological management will depend on the tools available at the center and on the characteristics of the patient. Non-contrast enhanced CT scan has high sensitivity and specificity, although concerns about radiation exposure and costs remain. It is essential to use computed tomography techniques that minimize radiation and to use alternatives like ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging in pregnant patients and children. There is no evidence to support strong recommendations regarding the frequency and type of imaging for follow-up of patients with urolithiasis (treated or under observation). The objective of this article is to review the imaging pathway for comprehensive stone management.</dc:description>
