<dc:description xml:lang="en">Henri Matisse (1869-1954) "Fauvisme", radically changed as for 1941, when he endured a severe surgery due to intestinal cancer. The resulting wound got necrosis, leading to a deficit at his abdominal muscles that impeached him to remain standing and paint. Sitting on his wheelchair, he started to cut out pieces of papers with which we created artistic collages. He died in 1954, aged 84, almost 13 years after his surgery. Claude Monet (1840-1926). After a journey to Venice in 1908, when he was 68 years old, cataracts were detected in Monet's both eyes, leading to the loss of his sight on his left eye and to an abnormal perception of colours on his right one. These alterations can be detected at his pieces of work. The surgery on his right eye en 1923, evoluted to a rare complication, know as "Xantopsia", that is, yellow-coloured sight, which was partially corrected through "Zeiss" linses. He died on lung cancer on 5th December 1926, aged 86.</dc:description>
