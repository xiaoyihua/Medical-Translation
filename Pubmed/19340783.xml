<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT Sensory systems show a topographic representation of the sensory epithelium in the central nervous system. In the auditory system this representation originates tonotopic maps. For the last four decades these changes in tonotopic maps have been widely studied either after peripheral mechanical lesions or by exposing animals to an augmented acoustic environment. These sensory manipulations induce plastic reorganizations in the tonotopic map of the auditory cortex. By contrast, acoustic trauma does not seem to induce functional plasticity at subcortical nuclei. Mechanisms that generate these changes differ in their molecular basis and temporal course and we can distinguish two different mechanisms: those involving an active reorganization process, and those that show a simple reflection of the loss of peripheral afferences. Only the former involve a genuine process of plastic reorganization. Neuronal plasticity is critical for the normal development and function of the adult auditory system, as well as for the rehabilitation needed after the implantation of auditory prostheses. However, development of plasticity can also generate abnormal sensation-like tinnitus. Recently, a new concept in neurobiology so-called 'neuronal stability' has emerged and its implications and conceptual basis could help to improve the treatments of hearing loss. CONCLUSION A combination of neuronal plasticity and stability is suggested as a powerful and promising future strategy in the design of new treatments of hearing loss.</dc:description>
