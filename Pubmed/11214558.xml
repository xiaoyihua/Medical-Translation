<dc:description xml:lang="en">In 1995 Alendronate was approved by the FDA for the treatment of Post-Menopause Osteoporosis. Their use for the preventive treatment on Osteopenic patients is approved in 1996. Calcium is a very important element in the treatment of Osteoporosis, because it is the only one that acts in the mineralization phase. It is well known that the first line to stop the loss of DMO in Post-Menopausic women are Estrogens. If we add TRH to the therapy, the effects of Alendronate will raise significantly. The first group (A) of 32 patients received Alendronate, Calcium and TRH. In the second group (B), there were 35 patients and they received Alendronate and Calcium. The groups were statistically compared and selected. In both groups the lumbar column was more affected than the hips. The use of TRH associated with Alendronate for the lumbar column significantly raised the percentage of change of DMO in 24 months. The change percentage was of 9% of DMO for group A and 5.25% for group B, giving a significant difference of 3.75% of DMO. For the hips the use of TRH associated with Alendronate did not have any difference in raise between both groups. In the next twelve months there was a change of 3.2% of DMO more in group A than in group B. In 24 months the change of DMO in the hips was of 7.95% in group A and 4.75% for group B. The TRH decrease the vasomotor symptoms, and improves the hormonal levels (FSH and Estradiol) keeping their benefits effective (Cardioprotectors, Neuroprotectors, etc.) but it potentiates the decrease of the bone reabsorption shown by the Alendronate. This significantly increases the change of percentage of DMO, obtaining densiometrics and clinical improvements in less time than using only Alendronate and Calcium. Also decreases the price of the treatment and the risk of fracture in less time, offering in that way a better quality of life to our patients.</dc:description>
