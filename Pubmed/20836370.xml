<dc:description xml:lang="en">A prospective, descriptive study was conducted at the Trauma and Orthopedics Service from January 1st, 2006 to January 1st, 2009; all patients with a diagnosis of open pelvic fracture were included. A total of 112 patients with pelvic fracture were seen at the Emergency Room; 12 of them with an open pelvic fracture; 75% were males, most of them ages 31 to 45 years of age; they were stabilized with a circular pelvic binder and external fixators with a V technique; a gastrointestinal bypass with colostomy was performed; 3 patients died within the first few hours due to hypovolemic shock, 5 survived a mean of 25 days and died due to other causes, and four patients were discharged alive. These lesions have a mortality rate of 66.66%; mediate mortality resulting from massive bleeding occurred in 25% and survival was 33.33%. The most frequent fractures (39.28%) according to the Tile classification were type C, which are the most unstable ones; according to the Bircher-Hargrove classification, most cases were type C, which are the most severe lesions and involve a high mortality rate and risk of contamination; it is therefore important to perform a gastrointestinal bypass and an emergency colostomy as part of the initial patient management.</dc:description>
