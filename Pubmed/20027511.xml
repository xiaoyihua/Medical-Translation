<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Assessing the prevalence of cardiometabolic factors in residents from a community in the north of Valencia city, Venezuela, and establishing clustering patterns for the cardiometabolic alterations. METHODS One hundred people aged 19 to 77 were studied. Weight, height, abdominal circumference, blood pressure, glucose, lipid profile and insulin were all measured. Insulin resistance was estimated by HOMA. RESULTS The five most prevalent cardiometabolic factors were low HDLc (90 %), overweight/obesity (78 %), abdominal obesity (68 %), hypercholesterolemia (59 %) and insulin resistance (54,8 %). Low HDLc frequency was higher in women (p &lt;0,01). Subjects aged 35 to 55 demonstrated higher cardiometabolic factor frequency. Metabolic syndrome prevalence was 57 %, prevailing in women. Three or four factors were found in most individuals. The most commonly occurring factors in the identified clusters were overweight/obesity, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal obesity and low HDLc. The body mass index and insulin resistance predicted metabolic syndrome in the evaluated group. CONCLUSIONS High cardiometabolic factor prevalence was found in the community being studied as well as a high tendency for several of these factors to cluster, thereby indicating the need to execute programmes focusing on reducing cardiometabolic risk.</dc:description>
