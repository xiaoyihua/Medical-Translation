<dc:description xml:lang="en">Constructivism, more than a posture or a school concept, is a specific feature of the psychic process. The term "specific" needs to be understood taking into account two senses. On the one hand, as a first sense, one must consider it as something inherent to the psychic process. On the other, as a second sense, it means that constructivism in the psychic process has distinctive characteristics: and this make it differ from the concept of constructivism applied in other fields. The fact of considering the psychism as a "construction" lets explain those mental productions such as art and science; as well as madness and crime: possibilities and risks of that construction.</dc:description>
