<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To determine the availability of intravascular fluid volume replacement solutions in Spanish hospitals, to survey the extent of use of colloids by anesthesiologists, to ascertain the possible adverse effects they seek to prevent when using each solution, and to assess their level of knowledge about the subject. MATERIAL AND METHODS A questionnaire was administered over a period of 6 months (July 2004-January 2005). The questionnaire was available online at www.encuestacoloides.com. The address was distributed by e-mail to anesthesiologists of all the Spanish autonomous communities and published in the Revista Española de Anestesiología y Reanimación. RESULTS One hundred forty-two anesthesiologists responded. Crystalloids and colloids were widely available in most hospitals. Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions were the colloids most often used (73%), followed by gelatins (28%). Dextran solutions, on the other hand, were no longer being used. The reasons the respondents gave for using these solutions were related to the time they remained in the vascular system, their greater effect of volume expansion, and the preservation of hemostasis. The most-feared complication was anaphylactic reaction to gelatins and there were concerns about the dose limit for infusion of HES solutions and about hemodynamic instability caused by dextran solutions. Fifty-four percent felt that scientific meetings provide little information about colloids and volume replacement. CONCLUSIONS There is widespread use of colloids other than dextran along with crystalloids for plasma volume replacement. Spanish anesthesiologists are clear about important concepts related to colloid use. However, a high percentage have doubts about certain fundamental issues. Continuing professional development opportunities related to intravascular fluid replacement therapy should be increased.</dc:description>
