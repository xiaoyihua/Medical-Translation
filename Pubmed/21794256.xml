<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the medium-term functional and radiological results in patients with hemiarthroplasty of the shoulder. MATERIAL AND METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in 25 patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis of any etiology, age, sex and occupation who underwent hemiarthroplasty of the shoulder using a deltopectoral approach with placement of a cemented modular hemiprosthesis; between November 2000 and December 2002. Functional evaluation (Constant 0-100 points) and radiological assessment were performed to determine the "radiological risk" of prosthetic clinical loosening. Descriptive and inferential statistics for the study variables were performed. RESULTS The prevalence of surgical disease was 0.4% of all first-time orthopedic consultations. The mean age was 61.7±12.49 (range 32-85 years); men accounted for 8.6% and women for 91.4%. The most frequent etiology was degenerative (45.8%). The most frequently affected side was the left (54.3%). With a mean follow-up of 19±8.6 months, functional evaluation was 60±12 points; radiological evaluation showed that 20.8% of the patients presented "radiological risk" for prosthetic clinical loosening whereas only 4.2% showed no line of radiolucency. Postoperative pain was significantly lower than preoperative pain (p&lt;0.05); mean satisfaction was 72%. Complications occurred in 8.3%. CONCLUSION The functionality of the operated shoulder was good and radiological evaluation showed satisfactory medium-term results in patients with hemiarthroplasty of the shoulder.</dc:description>
