<dc:description xml:lang="en">The model developed by Barreiro, Salas and Herrera (7) for the prediction of nutrient losses during the thermal processing of conduction heated foods was used in this work to optimize the thermal processing, maximizing nutrient retention in processes with equivalent sterilization values. The processes were stimulated in a digital computer (taking pea purée canned in cans 307 x 409 as the product analyzed). Aall of the processes had equivalent sterilization values with respect to Clostridium botulinum. The thiamine retention associated with each process was calculated by the model of Barreiro, Salas and Herrera (7). The maximum fraction of thiamine retained was of 0.688 for a process at 114.2 degrees C (237.5 degrees F) for 95 minutes. Also, the possibility of the existence of a can with optimum dimensions for maximum thiamine retention, with the same sterilization values, was studied. It was found that this optimum, with the same does not exist; on the contrary, the retention was at a minimum when the diameter approaches infinite and the height zero, and viceversa. For this reason, from the nutrient retention point of view, it is better to process the product in flat or slender cans for a given sterilization value.</dc:description>
