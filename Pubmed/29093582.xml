<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the endoscopic management of Zenker Diverticulum with IT-Knife 2 device. MATERIALS AND METHODS prospective and multicenter study (Edgardo Rebagliati Martins National Hospital and Golf Clinic). We included all patients with sintomatic Zenker Diverticulum that were treated with endoscopic cricopharyngeal miotomy from september 2013 until august 2016. TECHNIQUE the diverticulum septum was faced with a cap, and then it was cut by the IT-Knife 2 (ENDOCUT Q, effect 3-2-5) until its baseline. Disphagia score was compared before and 1 and 3 months after the procedure. RESULTS 20 patients were included (11 men; average age: 71 years). The median size of Zenker Diverticulum was 40.5 mm. The median duration of the cricopharyngeal miotomy was 13.75 minutes. Clinical success was 100%. There was a significative decrease (p&lt;0.001) in the disphagia score from 2+/-0.86 before the procedure to 0.05+/-0.22 one month after it. Recurrence after 3 months was 15% and it was completely solved after a second endoscopic treatment. Niether perforation nor bleeding was reported. Two patients had pneumonia. CONCLUSION the endoscopic management of Zenker Diverticulum with IT-Knife 2 is highly effective, safe and less complex than previous technique experience.</dc:description>
