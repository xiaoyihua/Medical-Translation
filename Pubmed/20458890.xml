<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hygiene is a technique that has to do with strict monitoring and control based on knowledge and a good team for the critically ill patient does not suffer its consequences such as: hemodynamic instability mismatch breathing... Considering this and there is little literature on the subject, the objectives of the study are what the patient's hemodynamic changes are more common when conducting hygiene and in what time period are, find out what are the complications or accidental events that prevail during the procedure and consider whether the experience of the nurse in relation to these events, among others. This is a descriptive research design and intervention. The sample consists of patients admitted to the ICU Hospital Universitario de Girona Dr. Josep Trueta. To collect the data has been used a record that shows the patient's vital signs before, during and after the hygiene, and a number of additional data that refer to different situations and events are considered of interest. Taking into account the patient's baseline, data were analyzed considering changes or hemodynamic instability in any patient that varies by 10% in any of the following constants: blood pressure (B.P.), heart rate (H.R.), Saturation (Sat. O2) or intracranial pressure (I.C.P.). The most relevant results, calculated with the SPSS program, we show that the most common complication is the increase of the H.R. (58.3%) and I.C.P. (100%) and that years of nursing experience does not relate to a greater degree of instability. We conclude that sometimes, before a potentially unstable patient or very labile to tampering, it is not essential to health that is why it is vital to the assessment and decision of the nurse.</dc:description>
