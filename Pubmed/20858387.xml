<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Primary hyperhidrosis is characterized by excessive sweating in a defined region of the body. It should not be considered a purely cosmetic problem as it has a significant impact on the social and professional relationships of affected individuals. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical profile of patients with primary hyperhidrosis and assess the results obtained with the use of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) in clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 52 patients (39 women and 13 men) with a diagnosis of primary hyperhidrosis treated for the first time with BTX-A. All patients completed a questionnaire that included the following information: age; sex; profession; age at onset, family history, and site of hyperhidrosis; accompanying signs and symptoms, and previous treatment; time to effect of BTX-A; local or systemic side effects; and severity of hyperhidrosis before and after BTX-A treatment. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Primary hyperhidrosis began during puberty in 61.5% of the patients included in the study, 75% were women, and the mean age was 29.9 years. In 36.5% of patients, first-degree relatives also had primary hyperhidrosis. Hyperhidrosis was classified as palmar in 61.5% of cases, plantar in 53.8%, and axillary in 59.6%. Other sites were affected less frequently. The most common accompanying symptoms were facial erythema (32.7%), palpitations (30.7%), muscle tension (28.8%), shivering (23%), and headache (17.3%). Treatment with BTX-A was well tolerated and there was a highly significant reduction in the severity of hyperhidrosis 2 months after performing the treatment (P&lt;0.001).</dc:description>
