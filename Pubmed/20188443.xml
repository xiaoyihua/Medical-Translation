<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION People aged 85 years old and older constitute a growing population group. Falls and malnutrition are common in the elderly. OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of an individualized multifactorial intervention to reduce falls and malnutrition in community-dwelling persons aged 85 years old. MATERIAL AND METHODS The OCTABAIX study is a randomized controlled clinical trial lasting 3 years in primary care in Costa de Ponent (seven primary care teams). Community-dwelling elders born in 1924 who agreed to participate in the study have been included. Three in-home visits will be made annually by a trained nurse or physician and will be complemented by two biannual analytical studies. Participants will be followed-up for hospitalizations, falls and weight using a monthly calendar. The specifically-designed algorithm to detect risk factors for falls and malnutrition will be used to provide recommendations and specific, standardized interventions for risk reduction in a randomly selected intervention group. Two face-to-face interventions will be carried out and telephone calls will be made to reinforce adherence. The control group will follow routine primary care recommendations. The primary outcome is a decline in the rate of falls and malnutrition. RESULTS The OCTABAIX study aims to reduce the incidence of falls and the risk of malnutrition in the 328 patients included. CONCLUSIONS The OCTABAIX study will help to determine the characteristics of persons aged 85 years old as well as the rate of falls and nutritional risk. The effectiveness of the measures adopted to reduce these geriatric syndromes will also be assessed.</dc:description>
