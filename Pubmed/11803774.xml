<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the second middle of the XVI century lived in Arnedillo Juan and Francisco Somovilla, booths "maesse". The names of his wives were Anna Garcia and Iomar de Oña. The brothers of Juan and Anna were Mardia, Diego baptised on 20 of june of 1566, and Iñigo. Juan Somovilla passes away on 22 of December of 1574. His brother made the testament. We think that Juan was the surgeon that we contracted by Felipe II, instead of Francisco. Francisco Díaz talked about Arnedillo, as an important thermal baths in the treatment of the kidney diseases, in his text. If Arnedillo was a centre of treatment of urinary disease, the Somovilla family could learn here the surgery of bladder litiasis.</dc:description>
