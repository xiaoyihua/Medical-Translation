<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Quality of life is an important end-point in heart failure studies, as well as mortality and hospitalization rates. The Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire is the instrument used most widely to evaluate quality of life in research studies. We used this questionnaire to evaluate quality of life in a general population attended by a heart failure unit in Spain. PATIENTS AND METHOD 326 patients seen for the first time at the unit were evaluated. We analyzed the relationship between the questionnaire score and different clinical and demographic factors. RESULTS The median global score on the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire was relatively low (28). We found a strong correlation (P&lt;.001) between the score and functional class, sex (women had higher scores), and diabetes. We also found a correlation between the score and number of hospital admissions in the previous year (P&lt;.001), anemia (P&lt;.001) and etiology (P=.01), and a weak trend toward higher scores with increasing age (P=.04). The highest scores were observed in patients with valve disease disorders (43), and the lowest were seen in patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy (20) and ischemic heart disease (24). We found no correlation with time of evolution of heart failure or with left ventricular ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS The scores on the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire in a general population attended by a heart failure unit in Spain were relatively low. However, we found a strong correlation between this score and functional class, and also between this score and number of admissions in the previous year. These results suggest that the questionnaire adequately reflects the severity of the disease.</dc:description>
