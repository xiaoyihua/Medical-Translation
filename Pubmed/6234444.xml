<dc:description xml:lang="en">The results are shown in the research on 200 patients who were selected from a total of 6,776 patients with skin pathology from all over the country during a twenty-eight-month period, and who were assisted at the Occupational Dermatology Service of the Instituto Nacional de Seguros (INS) in San Jose, Costa Rica. Only one case of hiperergic reaction was reported in a patient in clinical remission after a three-month period under control. However, this reaction was caused by different compounds, and after the patient had changed his work environment.</dc:description>
