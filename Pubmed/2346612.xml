<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Westergren inclined technique can be used to determine the globular sedimentation rate (GSR) at 10 and 15 minutes which are equivalent to the first and second hours respectively of the classic method. The present study compares GSR correlations using both methods, on a sample of 64 healthy children, included according to predetermined study selection criteria. The sample included 38 preschoolers (59.37%) and 26 school children (48.63%); with an age range between 4.14 +/- 0.48 years and 8.68 +/- 0.62 years (mean +/- 2 EE) respectively. The hematocrit range was between 38.75 +/- 0.56 Vol%; no erythrocyte alterations were observed. A significant positive correlation was observed in the GSR determinations between 1 hour-10 min and 2 hours-15 min, which were r1 = 0.9049 (P less than 0.001) and r2 = 0.9404 (P less than 0.001). No significant difference (P greater than 0.05) was noted on the basis of sex (34 males, 30 females). The determinations taken with the Westergren inclined method proved superior to the classic method, but the technique requires the inclusion of normal values of the former. The conclusion is that the inclined method can be used and interpreted by the clinician in the same way as the classic Westergren method. It permits a time saving, which in large hospital practices implies an important economic factor.</dc:description>
