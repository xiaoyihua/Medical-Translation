<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To know the rate of nosocomial infections in open prostate surgery and to assess the application of pre-surgery preparation and preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis protocols at three public hospitals in the Autonomous Community of Madrid. MATERIALS AND METHODS Prospective observational and multicentre study, including all the patients operated on at the services monitored and admitted for more than 48 hours between 1 January and 31 December 2009. They were monitored from admittance until their discharge. RESULTS The rate of hospital infection observed was 3.38%. The most frequent infection was surgical localization, with an incidence rate of 2.77% (superficial=1.23%; deep=0.31%; organ-space=1.23%). The percentage of appropriate surgical prophylaxis, both in the indication and in the selection of antibiotics, initiation and duration, with respect to all those patients that received it, was 47.42%. According to the data obtained from their clinical records, the percentage of patients in which the pre-surgery preparation protocol was correctly complied with, was 92%. CONCLUSIONS The results obtained in this multicentre study can serve not only as a reference to other public hospitals, but they are also comparable to other international monitoring systems. Monitoring and controlling infections associated with healthcare must be a key aspect in Patient Care and Safety programmes.</dc:description>
