<dc:description xml:lang="en">Neonatal diabetes mellitus is defined as hyperglycemia detected in the first month of life of more than 2 weeks' duration, requiring insulin treatment. It is extremely uncommon (1/500,000 neonates) and is permanent in only 30% of cases. Several hypotheses concerning its etiology have been postulated, such as pancreatic immaturity, paternal uniparental isidisomy of chromosome 6, and the existence of a gene located in the 6 q 22-23 chromosome region subjected to imprinting and exclusively of paternal expression. The management of these patients is usually difficult. These neonates are underweight for their gestational age, and neither anti-insulin antibodies nor anti-islets are detected. We studied a neonate hospitalized because of low weight for his gestational age with dimorphic features and hyperglycemia since the 17 th day of life. Clinical and anatomical follow-up has been periodically performed to the present date. The child presents permanent neonatal diabetes with negative antibodies. Although various insulin patterns have been used since the onset of the syndrome, management remains difficult. The child presents hypothyroidism, bilateral neurosensory deafness, bilateral congenital cataract, myopia, dimorphic features, congenital stridor and slow weight-stature curve. The results of muscle biopsy and metabolic studies were normal. Wolfram's syndrome and mitochondrial diabetes were ruled out. This is an exceptional case of permanent neonatal diabetes associated with other malformations corresponding to no known syndromic patterns.</dc:description>
