<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune disorder mediated largely by food antigens. It shares nonspecific symptoms with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). EoE is rarely reported in Mexico, perhaps due to the racial characteristics of the population or because of insufficient diagnostic suspicion. AIMS Our aim was to describe a Mexican cohort with EoE and evaluate the usefulness of the clinical history and endoscopy in the EoE diagnosis, in comparison with GERD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study was carried out on the clinical characteristics and endoscopic and histopathologic findings in patients with EoE, along with a case-control study on patients with GERD. The endoscopic images obtained were interpreted in a blind and randomized manner by 4 gastroenterologists, before and after providing them with information on the characteristic alterations of EoE. The esophageal biopsies were also blinded to 2 pathologists that evaluated their diagnostic correlation. The Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used in the statistical analysis. RESULTS Fourteen patients with EoE were included in the study. Ten (71%) of them were men and the mean age of the patients was 35 years. There were more subjects with a personal history of asthma (p=0.0023) and food impaction (p=0.04) in the EoE group. The initial evaluation of the endoscopic findings showed 53% correct EoE interpretations and rose to 96% in the second revision (sensitivity 100%, specificity 71%, PPV 65%, NPV 100%). CONCLUSIONS Mexican patients with EoE have similar characteristics to those of patients in western case series. Clinical awareness of the disorder increases endoscopic diagnosis in up to 40% of cases.</dc:description>
