<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Since 1996, when HAART became available, there has been a change in the course of HIV-infection, leading it to become a chronic disease. Our aim was to describe the characteristics of the children followed up in our hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted on 32 HIV-infected children followed up until December-2010, at the University-Hospital de Getafe. Clinical and laboratory information from the last visit was collected for the evaluation of patients. RESULTS Thirty-two children with HIV-1 were evaluated, 29 infected through vertical-transmission. The median age was 14 years. According to the CDC classification, 56% (18/32) of children were in category A, 28% (9/32) B and 16% (5/32) C. Immunological class was 3 in 75% of children, class 2 in 9% and class 1 in 16%. The median nadir of CD4 was 337 cells/ml (12%). The median current CD4 was 749 (31%). Only one adolescent had a CD4% below 200 cells/ml due to lack of adherence. Twenty-eight patients (87%) were receiving HAART, and 4 patients were off antiretroviral treatment. Among the patients treated, 26 (93%) had viral loads &lt;200 copies/ml. The median viral-load was&lt;20 copies/ml. Median time on antiretroviral treatment was 10 years. The combination more frequently used was two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one protease inhibitor (PI), that was given to 15 patients (47%), followed by 2 NRTI, and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) in 8 patients (29%). Two children received rescue therapy including raltegravir, one with tipranavir and the other with darunavir. A total of 12 patients (43%) received medication once a day, 7 of them with fixed-dose combinations in a single tablet (25%). There were metabolic complications, including hyperlipidaemia or lipodystrophy were observed in 17 children (53%). CONCLUSIONS Most of our patients are receiving HAART, with good virological and immunological control. The prevalence of metabolic abnormalities was high. Strategies to improve adherence and decrease toxicities are needed in perinatally-acquired HIV-infected children.</dc:description>
