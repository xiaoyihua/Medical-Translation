<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of dyslipidemias in Mexico city and its relation to other cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS A cross sectional study was conducted to measure cardiovascular risk factors in Mexico City. All subjects were interviewed and anthropometric measures performed, as well as cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL-C) and triglycerides. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) values were calculated. Means- as well as dyslipidemia-weighted prevalence were measured, with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS 833 males and 889 females were studied. The prevalence of cholesterol ≥ 240 mg/dl was 16.4% (95% CI: 14.2-18.7), and 34.1% (95% CI: 31.6-36.5) had values between 200 and 240 mg/dl. Very high values of triglycerides were seen in 2.6% of studied subjects and 29.9% (95% CI: 26.9-32.8) had high values. The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia was higher in males (43.3%) than females (23%). Mean values of assessed parameters were in general higher in those with other cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Lipid values in the population of Mexico City are high and so is the prevalence of dyslipidemias. There is an urgent need to implement health policies directed to diminish cardiovascular risk factors, mainly dyslipidemias.</dc:description>
