<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To reveal the meaning of violence in everyday female prostitution. METHOD we used a phenomenological approach of Martin Heidegger. The survey was conducted in Teresina / Piau√≠ / Brazil, with 11 women members of the Association of Prostitutes of Piaui. The data were produced by means of open interviews conducted by a script with questions regarding their experience as a prostitute and its relationship to violence. RESULTS The reports indicate that it is prostitution a risky activity in which gender violence is a phenomenon present. In the relational world, prostitution and violence are intertwined in the face of negotiations established between women and men with formal contracts in the dark, verbally, without witnesses, and whose object of contract is the woman herself for the purpose of providing sexual pleasure to the contractor. Through interpretative analysis was possible to understand the lived violence leads women to remain in daily life where is this fear, inauthenticity and ambiguity. CONCLUSIONS violence unveils lived relations of domination and assertion of male power, manifested by violence physical, psychological, moral and sexual. The study advances in scientific knowledge by showing that violence against women, in prostitution, must be understood as a process factual as well as the suffering experienced by them.</dc:description>
