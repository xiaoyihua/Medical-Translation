<dc:description xml:lang="en">A study was completed to investigate if any differences are observed in user satisfaction with health care centres, polyclinics and solo-practice, furthermore to identify user, organizational characteristics and doctors as variables that relate to user satisfaction in health care. A sample of users was chosen from the Andalusian cities of Granada, Málaga and Sevilla with an alpha = 5%, beta = 10% and d = 11%. The variables were collected trough the use of three questionnaires. Greater satisfaction was found between health care centre users than with polyclinics and solo-practice, with values being 62.4, 58.2 and 60.6 with a p &lt; 0.001. The variables more strongly associated with user satisfaction in health care centres are those related with doctors and organization characteristics. Therefore several are capable of improvement in order to increase user satisfaction. On the contrary in polyclinics and solo-practice the most influential variables are those related with the user characteristics, which are not modifiable by the health services intervention.</dc:description>
