<dc:description xml:lang="en">Between March 1986 and March 1989, 20 children were diagnosed as having liver abscesses at the Pediatric Department of the Central Hospital in Valencia. 10 were amebic and 10 pyogenic abscesses. 85% occurred in children and 15% in infants. 15 of them (75%) were located in the right lobe, 80% of amebic abscesses had positive serological tests. An etiologic agent was found in 50% of the pyogenic abscesses (3: E. coli, 2: S. Aureus). 80 to 90% of patients presented abnormal prothrombin time. Sedimentation rate was very high in both groups, even at the discharge time. Hepatomegaly, fever, anemia and abdominal pain were the main clinical features. The macroscopic aspect of the aspirate was not helpful in the diagnosis. 60% of amebic liver abscesses needed only medical treatment but 80% of pyogenic abscesses deserved medical treatment and needle aspiration.</dc:description>
