<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To assess if cardiovascular risk (CVR) charts are able to identify the increased risk caused by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. LOCATION Urban and rural health centres in the province of Ourense. PARTICIPANTS Patients diagnosed with PCa who had been prescribed treatment for ADT between 2007 and 2008. MAIN MEASURES Age, residence (rural/urban), staging (Gleason), diagnostic procedure and, at the beginning and end of follow-up, lipid profile, blood pressure, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, smoking, use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs, and Framingham calibrated and ATP III indexes, were determined. Cardiovascular events were recorded during the follow-up. Each patient was his own control. Increasing age was not used in the calculation of the scores at the end of the follow up period. The scores were compared using the t-test for paired samples (SPSS 15.0). RESULTS A total of 209 cases were included. The mean (SD) age was 73.8 (8.0) years, with 64.6% of urban cases. The scores at baseline and at 12 months of follow-up were: Framingham 9.0 (4.6) and 9.2 (4.8) (P=0.5), ATP III 14.2 (1.7) and 14.2 (1.7) (P=0.9). CONCLUSION CVR charts do not assess the increased risk associated with androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.</dc:description>
