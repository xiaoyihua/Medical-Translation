<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION: The HIV and AIDS epidemic has quickly spread over the world with a tendency towards feminization, pauperization, and heterosexualization. Partner communication around HIV has been described as one protective factor for the acquisition of this disease, favoring the adoption of safe sexual practices, such as couple negotiation and condom use. Considering this is fundamental in the incorporation of self-care practices among female sexuality. OBJECTIVE: Determine the level of partner communication around HIV among socially disadvantaged Chilean women. METHODOLOGY: Four hundred and six (406) women responded the baseline interview for the research project "Testing and HIV/AIDS Prevention Intervention for Chilean Women" (RO1 TW 006977, PI. Cianelli). The scale Health Protective Sexual Communication Scale (HPC) was used (range between 0-10 points). A descriptive analysis was done using SPSS, version 16.0. RESULTS: The mean level of partner communication with the main partner was 3,26 +2,7 points, of 2,52 +2,48 points with the second partner, and 0 points with the third partner. The themes related with less partner communication were the condom use and getting an HIV test before having sexual intercourse. CONCLUSION: Women in the sample had low levels of partner communication in relation with HIV with all their sexual partners. Strategies within HIV/AIDS prevention programs are needed to trigger this area, in order to strengthen the adoption of self care behaviors around this issue.</dc:description>
