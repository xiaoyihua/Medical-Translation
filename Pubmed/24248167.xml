<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Endogenous endophthalmitis (EE) is a prevalent but serious disease. Our aim was to describe cases of EE, with emphasis in the risk factors and the improvement of the prognosis. METHODS A review of EE cases was done between 1996-2011 in a secondary care hospital in Spain. The reported variables were: comorbidities, isolated microorganisms, susceptibility to antimicrobial treatment and visual prognosis. RESULTS 9 cases of EE were analyzed. All had some underlying disease, diabetes mellitus being the most frequent. Seven of the nine cases had a history of eye injury. Extraocular source of infection was identified in 7 cases, with predominantly gastrointestinal disease. Most microorganisms were isolated from blood cultures. The visual prognosis was unfavorable in five patients and was associated with virulent microorganisms and delayed treatment. CONCLUSIONS EE is a rare disease that involve immunocompromised patients with ophthalmic disease. To improve prognosis, appropriate diagnosis and early treatment is require. Therefore, we recommend funduscopy examination in patients with sepsis, risk factors and prior history of ocular disease.</dc:description>
