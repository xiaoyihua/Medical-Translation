<dc:description xml:lang="en">In Mexico, more of 36% of malignant tumors in the women are cervical cancer, representing an important public health problem. Although cytologic screening for cervical cancer was introduced in 1974, the mortality rate for this disease has been increasing. The state of Durango represents the second national place in mortality by CaCu (3.4/100,000). Since there are few the studies of DOC program evaluation in Mexico were considered important to evaluated the cervical screening program (coverage, assiduity, diagnoses and pursuit) in the state of Durango. Of 40,000 active sexually women attended in the IMSS; we received 11,185 slides during May of 1999 to April of 2000 for cytologic screening. The coverage in this population was 27.96% (11,185/40,000), 8,187 women (73.2%) had cytologic control at least previous two years, 652 (5.83%) had more of four years without control and 2,346 (21%) assisted for first time. The cytological diagnostic showed 189 abnormal Pap (1.68%), and only 40 of them (21.16%) had cytohistopatholgic pursuit and clinic treatment. According to these results we concluded that DOC program in Gomez Palacio, Durango has a deficiency of coverage (72.04%) and pursuit (78.84%). These results indicated the need for development institutional activities of prevention for increase efficiency of preventive services.</dc:description>
