<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Analyzing the spatio-temporal relationship regarding the occurrence of cases of dengue in Colombia's Córdoba Department and the temperature, rainfall and the phenological state of vegetation (vigor and density). METHODS A statistical and cartographical study of spatio-temporal distribution regarding the occurrence of cases of dengue was studied in 30 selected municipalities. Simple and multiple statistical regressions were used for analyzing disease occurrence and the aforementioned climatic variables. The statistical relationship between dengue cases and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated using satellite images. A linear multiple relationship between the occurrence of dengue cases and temperature, rainfall and NDVI was calculated. RESULTS Accordingly to the pertinent cartography, the disease extends over 32 % of the department; 89.7 % of the reported cases of dengue occurred in 13 of the 22 selected municipalities, Monteria being the municipality having the greatest occurrence (37.8 %). Analysis and evaluation of the statistical regressions showed that the selected climatic variables and vegetation state were significantly related to the occurrence of dengue, both separately and simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS The statistical validity of the relationships calculated between the variables studied here supported the conclusion that an increase in the occurrence of cases of dengue was also directly related to a simultaneous increase in temperature, decreased rainfall and deterioration of vegetation cover (vigor and density) in the area being studied.</dc:description>
