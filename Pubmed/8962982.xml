<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to review the characteristics of conventional antigens and the way they work, as well as to remark their differences with superantigens. They bind exclusively to the lymphocytic TCR V beta portion, are not processed by macrophages, are related to dependent HLA but not restrained HLA and are able to stimulate a hugh number of lymphocytes, leading them to destruction. Different microorganisms (toxins from S. aureus, S. pyogenes, M. arthritidis, etc. produce a high number of superantigens, which have been associated with infectious diseases, especially by HIV. They have also been related to immunological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, Siögren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, etc. In conclusion, these new molecules will enable us to review the etiology of many diseases and, the most relevant from a clinical point of view, its treatment.</dc:description>
