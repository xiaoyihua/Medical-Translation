<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Bariatric surgery has demonstrated its efficacy in weight loss and in reducing the comorbidities in the morbid obesity patient. The objectives of this study were to analyze the effectiveness and complication of the Scopinaro and gastric bypass techniques as well as the results from open surgery verses laparoscopy. DESIGN Retrospective study from 1999-2005. SUBJECT AND METHODS 78 patients with morbid obesity were operated. 50 patients underwent open surgery and 28 underwent laparoscopy. Gastric bypass was performed in 54 patients, Scopinaro was performed in 20 patients and Vertical Banded Gastroplasty (VBG) was performed in 3 patients. The follow up time was between 6 and 60 months. The results obtained with Scopinaro and gastric bypass were compared as well as the results from open surgery verses laparoscopy. RESULTS The percentage of patients with a percent of excess weight loss under 50% in two years was of 5% and 13%, and the excess weight loss over 75% was of 55% ad 40% in the gastric bypass and the Scopinaro technique respectively. All the comorbidities improved. The average stay was decreased in the case of laparoscopy. The non-nutritional complications were increased for most cases in open surgery with the emphasis in eventrations, infections of the wound and respiratory complications. The nutritional complications were superior with Scopinaro's technique. CONCLUSIONS Based on our study, we would recommend the performance of gastric bypass for laparoscopy due to the reduced average stay and less nutritional and surgical complications. The literature results vary and therefore we consider necessary further control and random studies to correctly establish these comparisons.</dc:description>
