<dc:description xml:lang="en">There are evidence indicating that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy (ERCP+S) reduces the rate of complications in patients with severe acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP). The aim of this study was to analyze our experience in the treatment of severe ABP with ERCP+S and compare the evolution of the patients treated early (3 days or less following admission) with those treated late (after the 3rd day). A retrospective review of the clinical histories of the 16 patients with severe ABP treated with ERCP+S over the last two years is presented, analyzing their clinical features on admission and evolution. Biliary stones or biliary sludge was observed in 11 cases (69%). Nine patients had undergone early, and 7 late, ERCP+S. The patients of the latter group presented a greater number of complications during evolution than the former group (43% vs 0%; p = 0.025). The mortality of the patients of the late ERCP+S was also greater although without statistical significance (28.6% vs 0%; p = 0.15). No complication secondary to ERCP+S was detected. These findings confirm the fact that ERCP+S performed early in severe ABP significantly reduces the number of complications and is associated with a lower mortality.</dc:description>
