<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors evaluate the adoption of a protocol to recuperate blood from drainage during surgery for knee prosthesis. They carried out a prospective study on 19 patients diagnosed with knee arthrosis and who underwent surgery for Total Knee Arthroplasty from September 2006 through June 2007. The medical instrument used was Bellovac, produced by Astral Tech. In the Post anesthesia Reanimation Unit, four patients received a homologous transfusion (27.50%). Prior to the adoption of this protocol, the rate of transfusion was 37%. Hemoglobin during preoperative procedures was not a risk factor for a homologous transfusion. This is associated with the volume drained and reinserted. Patients who received a transfusion had drained 450 cc or more. The study did not record any complication due to the use of the recuperating device. The use of this device made it possible to decrease homologous blood transfusions.</dc:description>
