<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Quality of Life of cancer patients and its assessment are of great important nowadays. They are useful in offering a treatment that is better adapted to the characteristics of the patient and the development of his/her illness. Patients have to evaluate their Quality of Life through measurement instruments. The European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer-EORTC is an international body devoted to research in cancer treatment. One of its divisions is working on the study of the Quality of Life. They have developed a core questionnaire for Quality of Life measurement and modules for different types of tumour and treatment to complement this. The Oncology Department of the Hospital of Navarra has been collaborating in this group since 1992. The Department has participated in the creation or validation of the core questionnaire and different modules. It is measuring the Quality of Life in different clinical studies. All members of the department are collaborating in these studies.</dc:description>
