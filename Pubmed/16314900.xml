<dc:description xml:lang="en">The concept of resistance in the treatment of bipolar disorders is not adequately formalized at present. This is due to the complexity of the evaluation of treatment effectiveness in a clinical scenario of heterogeneous development where huge differences between the degrees of recuperation achieved by different groups of patients can be observed. The use of an oversimplified concept of resistance to treatment favours the appearance of inadequate therapeutic strategies and the inclusion of treatment proposals devoid of evidence. On the other hand, a concept of resistance which does not take into account the clinical characteristics of these cases makes the understanding of results difficult for patients in treatment. Certain psychotherapies and pharmacological tools do at least share a level of consensus that grant their suggestion in cases of poor response to conventional therapeutics.</dc:description>
