<dc:description xml:lang="en">Temporary henna tattoos have become increasingly popular in the last few years, because of their apparent harmlessness and disappearance in few weeks. Black henna contains paraphenylenediamine (PPD), a synthetic colorant which is used in hair dyes and can cause sensitization. Many cases of allergic contact dermatitis occurring after tattooing have been reported, especially in children and teenagers during the summer time, since there are many tattoo-painters at holiday places and the parents are unaware of the risks of these tattoos. Clinicians, particularly pediatricians, primary care physicians and dermatologists should seek to remedy this misinformation. We can be the first person to be consulted before the tattoo painting and we will treat patients with lesions. We present our experience of eight cases of allergic contact dermatitis after tattooing and briefly review the literature on the risks of black henna tattoos.</dc:description>
