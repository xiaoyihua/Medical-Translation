<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND DATA Hipotensive lower esophageal sphincter (HLES) has been considered the most frequent finding in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Recently it has been published that esophageal dismotility (ED) has a higher prevalence in GERD. OBJECTIVE To compare the prevalence of HLES with ED in patients with GERD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Consecutive patients with endoscopic esophagitis grade II or higher and abnormal esophageal acid exposure time in pH-monitoring were evaluated. Stationary esophageal manometry were performed in all patients. HLES was defined by: a) LES pressure &lt; 10 mmHg, b) LES length &lt; 2 cm and c) LES abdominal segment &lt; 1 cm. ED was defined by: a) presence of more than 30% of peristaltic waves with an amplitude &lt; 30 mmHg or b) more than 10% of simultaneous waves in distal esophagus. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients, 27 women and 10 men were evaluated. Twelve patients (32.4%) had ED, 5 (13.5%) showed HLES. Four of these 17 patients had both abnormalities. Fifteen patients (40.5%) had normal findings and in 5 (13.5%) a high LES pressure was found. CONCLUSIONS Esophageal dismotility is the most common manometric abnormality in patients with GERD.</dc:description>
