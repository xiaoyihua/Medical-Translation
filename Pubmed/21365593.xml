<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Positive psychology has boosted interest about the study of factors of adjustment, among which is included satisfaction with life. AIM To analyze the relationship between satisfaction with life of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and their parents with behavioral risk and protective variables, and to determine the predictive power of these variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS 56 parents and their children with ADHD filled out questionnaires of satisfaction with life, self-concept, sense of coherence, success attributes and behavioral rating scales. RESULTS Behavioral problems have a significant negative relationship with satisfaction with life perceived by parents and by children while the relationships with the self-concept and success attributes have a positive value. The most predictive factors were social problems, oppositional behavior, self-concept, self-awareness and social support. CONCLUSIONS The identification of factors that put at risk or enhance satisfaction with life of people with ADHD will improve the functionality of evaluation and intervention processes.</dc:description>
