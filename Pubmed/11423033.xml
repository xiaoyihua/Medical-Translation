<dc:description xml:lang="en">The causes of many health problems such as smoking are beyond individual action. To change them requires the development of interventions dealing with the social factors that cause them, interventions of a political nature. In this paper we review for Spain public policies influencing smoking, with an emphasis on those with greater potential impact (fiscal policies to increase price, and those controlling the promotion and publicity of tobacco products), as well as the role of different government levels in regulation (local, regional central and European). The role of the Central government and of the European Union are crucial today in Spain. Some aspects influencing the adoption of smoking prevention policies (problem definition, private interests, and ideology) are also analyzed, as well as the need for a strategic coalition to promote them.</dc:description>
