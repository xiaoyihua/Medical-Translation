<dc:description xml:lang="en">There is strong evidence favoring colorectal cancer screening. Preliminary data suggests that it is not included in routine practice with the adequate frequency. We intended to recognize in a Health Care System (HCS) that provides the needed resources, the facilitators and barriers related with the implementation of this preventive practice, how many individuals have carried out one procedure and what this preventive activity predicts. A telephone survey was administered to a sample of affiliates from an HCS that serves employees of the University of Buenos Aires; 132 completed the questionnaire (70% response rate). Facilitators obtained an affirmative response in a 64 to 97%, and barriers from 11 to 27%. In the latter category a special subgroup (39%) was afraid of adverse events, and there was a feeling of embarrassment in others (30%); 33% of respondents had carried out a screening procedure, mainly FOBT 27, sigmoidoscopy 11 and colonoscopy 20. A majority (95%) stated that they "would do the procedure if doctors recommend it", or "not do it unless my doctor advises to do it" (87%). Answering affirmatively that "physicians will do the best for their patients" was associated with having had a CRC screening test, OR 1.55 (95% CI: 1.02-2.37) p: 0.04. Studied individuals showed good predisposition for colorectal cancer screening, but to put it into practice, medical advice seems to be a prominent determinant.</dc:description>
