<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Describe the resources for the treatment of breast cancer in Mexico. METHODS Information was obtained from 23 Centros Estatales de Cáncer (State Cancer Centers, CEC), two federal hospitals and Cancerología. This study was performed in Mexico City in August/September of 2008. RESULTS These 23 centers provide medical care for breast cancer including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy; all of them validated by the Seguro Popular. The costs were defined according to clinical stage and ranged from $27,500.00 pesos for clinical stage 0 to $480,00.00 in the advanced stage. A total of 2 689 women with breast cancer have been treated; only 1% was reported with in situ carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS An adequate medical infrastructure is in place to treat breast cancer in Mexico. The costs are high due to late diagnosis of the disease. Early detection of breast cancer is a high priority for optimal control of this disease in Mexico.</dc:description>
