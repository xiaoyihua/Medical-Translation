<dc:description xml:lang="es">The systematic review and meta-analysis form a part of secondary research which begins with the study of the evidence available on a certain health care intervention in order to respond to specific questions by means of an explicit and rigorous methodology. The first step in its elaboration is the writing of the research question that will define the inclusion criteria of the studies of our review: study methodology, participants, interventions, comparisons to be studied and measurements of the results. These characteristics will define the study protocol and their correct definition will facilitate the rest of the procedure. The following stage consists in the search for studies in the scientific literature on the subject in question and the critical reading of them to rule out, sometimes only by reading the title or abstract and others by reading the complete article, those that do not fulfill our selection criteria. Finally, those remaining will be included in the study. These studies will make up our review and will be used to obtain the necessary data and to evaluate them both qualitatively and quantitatively. In those cases where there is homogeneity between the studies included and where at least two of them have reasonably combinable data, a quantitative analysis called meta-analysis will be conducted. This is generally done with the help of computerized statistical programs that aid this work and that make it possible to visualize the results graphically in the so-called forest plot. The last phase of the review, as in the rest of the epidemiological studies, consists in interpreting the results obtained and in drawing the corresponding conclusions. In this type of studies, they will have repercussions in both the research and clinical practice</dc:description>
