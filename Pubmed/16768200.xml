<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hypoglossal-facial anastomosis was performed in four patients with total peripheral facial palsy after removal of cerebellopontine tumors (three patients with neurinoma) and pontine aneurysm (one patient). The anastomosis was performed after a period of 3 months to one year from surgery. The results obtained, concerning the facial activity, were clinically valued according to the tests used (questionnary, and the House-Brackmann paralysis index); the EnOG was used for its electrophysiological assessment. The follow-up period was 4 years with a good facial recovery in three patients and poor in one (class V, 27% in ENoG). We observe that the improvement in function greatly depends on the early surgical process performance.</dc:description>
