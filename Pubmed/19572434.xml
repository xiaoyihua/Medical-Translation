<dc:description xml:lang="en">Until relatively recently, the treatment available for invasive fungal infections in hematological patients consisted of amphotericin B and azoles. Each of these groups had limitations and secondary effects. The echinocandins are a new class of antifungal agent that has shown promising results in the treatment of numerous invasive fungal infections. Anidulafungin is a new echinocandin that, in addition to showing potent in vitro activity against Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. (including fluconazole- and amphotericin B-resistant microorganisms), also provides some advantages over other candins. In humans, these drugs are degraded through biotransformation rather than a metabolic process. No drug interactions have been found. In hematological patients, anidulafungin would play a "potential" role as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenia, as is the case of caspofungin. Given the epidemiology of Candida infection in these patients, anidulafungin could be used as initial therapy in candidemia before starting treatment with oral flucozanole, if indicated by the fungigram. This drug would also be indicated in the treatment of invasive Aspergillus spp. infections in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency or in those taking concomitant medications. The available in vitro studies also suggest an important role for this drug in combinations of antifungal agents. Given the excellent safety profile and absence of interactions of anidulafungin, this drug will undoubtedly be of great utility in the management of difficult-to-treat mycotic infections in hematological patients.</dc:description>
