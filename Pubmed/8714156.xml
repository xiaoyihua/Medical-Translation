<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Clostridium difficile is currently recognized as an important nosocomial enteric pathogen. The significance as etiologic agent of community and nosocomial diarrhea is not well known in Spain. METHODS Retrospective study of all cases of community diarrhea that required admission in the hospital and all nosocomial diarrhea observed in a period of three months in a 450-bed university hospital. We performed conventional coprocultives and detection of toxin-A of C. difficile with the method ELISA Premier. RESULTS During the period of study were included 66 patients, 19 pediatrics and 47 adults patients (23 males, 24 females, age: 54.5 +/- 21.8 years). Three cases (15.8%) of pediatrics patients were diagnosticated of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, only one case were of nosocomial origin. Toxin A of C. difficile were detected in 6 cases, all were patients under two years old, represented 60% of these patients. The origin of diarrhea were: community in 32 cases and nosocomial in 15 of adults patients, in 18 cases (38.3%) were diagnosticated antibiotic-associated diarrhea, 11 were nosocomial. Toxin A of C. difficile were detected in 12 patients, 25.5% of adults, and 4 cases had criteria of C. difficile associated diarrhea, representing 8.5% of the diarrhea. None of this cases were suspected during admission. CONCLUSIONS Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and C. difficile associated diarrhea were not infrequent cause of diarrhea of nosocomial and of community origin in our environment. We recommended culture and/or detection of toxins of C. difficile in patients who were treated with antibiotics and diarrhea of more than 72 hours of evolution.</dc:description>
