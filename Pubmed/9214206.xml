<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the feasibility and diagnostic performance of the one hour pad test proposed by ICS. PATIENTS AND METHODS The pad test was performed in 20 women referred for incontinence. Five were included in a surgical protocol and 15 had inconsistent medical history. Their mean age was 52.5 years, the mean time of incontinence was 3.4 years and they used a mean of 3.5 pads/day. Six showed leakage on physical examination (PE) and 2 during previous cystometry. RESULTS The test is well tolerated and lasts one hour and 15 minutes. The test was positive in 17 (mean leakage = 168 g). Leakage was not related to duration of incontinence, number of pads or cystometric capacity. A weak negative correlation (r = -0.52) was found between leakage and voided volume on uroflowmetry performed after the test. All patients who leaked on PE had a positive test and a significantly higher leakage compared to patients who didn't leak on PE. CONCLUSION The pad test is a feasible outpatient procedure in the context of a Urodynamics Unit, providing objective information on leakage in most patients.</dc:description>
