<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the evolution and characteristics of the NANDA taxonomy I nursing diagnosis of «situational low self-esteem» (SLS) and its related factors in Primary Care patients from the towns of Fuenlabrada and Leganés in the Autonomous Community of Madrid, in the period 2003-2009. METHOD An observational retrospective case series of patients diagnosed by their Primary Care nurse with SLS according to the NANDA I taxonomy. This case series was performed in the towns of Fuenlabrada and Leganes (Madrid). Descriptive analysis of the variables obtained from the database management software for electronic health records in Primary Care (OMI AP). Data observed in percentages. The main variable is 00120 NANDA I diagnosis: SLS. A total of 342 care plans with a SLS diagnosis having completed all the nursing process phases. The NANDA, NOC and NIC classifications were used for the diagnostic formulas, the performance criteria to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of care, and the interventions that were performed to achieve them. The assessment of the nursing process was made according to the Marjory Gordon Functional Health Patterns. RESULTS The incidence between 2003 and 2009 increased 8-fold. The large majority (80%) were women, with 52.4% between 40 and 64 years. Eighteen percent of the cases were closed, with 88% positively resolved. The most frequent distinctive characteristic was «negative self-verbalization» (26.5%). The main related factors were «disturbed body image» (23.8%). The most established NOC was «to improve the self-esteem» (41.3%) and its evolution was positive in 61%. Just over half (53.2%) of the interventions were «to increase facing up to responsibilities» and «to boost self-esteem». More than half (55%) of the diagnoses were made due to psychological causes, with episodes of a feeling anxiety-nervousness-tension in 33%. CONCLUSIONS Although the approach is still difficul, the resolution of psychosocial problems, particularly those of self-esteem, continue to improve. The diagnoses with follow-up show positive results. We must increase our knowledge of psychosocial problems and communication skills in order to respond to the current demands of the population.</dc:description>
