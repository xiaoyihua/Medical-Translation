<dc:description xml:lang="en">The present article analyzes the structure of public health services in the USA. It aims to describe the perspective of 200 years of a federal organization of public health services, which could be useful in the current context in Spain. Information was obtained by interviews with key informants from the three levels of government (federal, state, and local) and with academics (many of whom had previous experience as public health officers). Special attention is paid to the organization, financing and activities of local and state health departments, as well as to the relationships between these departments. The implications for a country like Spain, which has evolved in a short period from a highly centralized system to a decentralized system based on 17 Autonomous Communities, is discussed.</dc:description>
