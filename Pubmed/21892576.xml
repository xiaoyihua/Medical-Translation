<dc:description xml:lang="en">Several years ago, it was recommended not to add vitamins or oligoelements to parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions and to administer them immediately after the addition of the micronutrients to avoid their decay. Nowadays, it has been observed that with multilayer bags, ternary mixtures and sunlight protection vitamins degradation is minimal. Daily intake of micronutrients is necessary in the critically ill, malnourished or long-term PN patients. Aiming at knowing the schedules of use of micronutrients in PN in Spanish hospitals and the way PN bags are prepared regarding the factors conditioning their stability, we undertook a telephone survey to the pharmacists in charge of PN at the different hospitals. We compared the data obtained with those from other surveys performed in 2001 and 2003. Pharmacists from 97 hospitals answered the questionnaire (answer rate 88%). The hospital sizes ranged 104-1728 beds. As compared to the data form preceding years, we observed a better adequacy to the current recommendations, although there are still 30% of the hospitals that administer micronutrients on an every other day basis independent of the clinical situation of the patients. In most of the hospitals, multilayer bags are used and/or sunlight protection and ternary mixtures. According to these results showing the different criteria for administering vitamins and oligoelements in PN solutions, it seems necessary to elaborate consensus documents that adapt to the reality of the diverse practices besides promoting the performance of well-designed clinical studies establishing the requirements under special clinical situations.</dc:description>
