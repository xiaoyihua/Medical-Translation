<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The Preventive Health Examination of older people in Chile incorporates the timed up and go (TUG) and right and left unipodal stance test (RUPS and LUPS) as functional assessment methods. AIM To assess if TUG and LUPS discriminate older people with different degrees of disability. MATERIAL AND METHODS TUG, RUPS and LUPS were assessed in 860 participants aged 71.3 ± 6.9 years (591 females) attending a primary health care clinic. The results of the three tests were expressed in seconds. Participants were classified as non-disabled without any risk, non-disabled with risk and in risk of dependence, using the Functional Assessment of Older People of EFAM (the Spanish acronym), previously validated for Chilean older people. RESULTS In all participants TUG, LUPS and RUPS values were 8.9 ± 3.6, 10 ± 10.6 and 9.7 ± 10.3 seconds (sec) respectively. Among non-disabled participants without risk, the values for TUG, RUPS and LUPS were: 7.9 ± 2.3, 12.7 ± 11.1 and 12.2 ± 10.9 sec respectively. The figures for non-disabled participants with risk were 8.4 ± 2.6, 8.8 ± 9.8 and 8.9 ± 9.8 sec respectively. The figures for participants in risk of dependence were 11.7 ± 5.3, 5.1 ± 7.8 and 4.5 ± 7.1 sec, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In this group of older participants there is an association between the degree of disability and the results of TUG, RUPS and LUPS.</dc:description>
