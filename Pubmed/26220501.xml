<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Echinococcosis is a zoonotic infection with a worldwide distribution, and is still an important health problem in many areas of the world, including the Mediterranean basin. At present the epidemiological situation is unclear in certain regions of Spain. The aim of this study was to update the epidemiological situation in Extremadura through an analysis of hospitalised patients in the public health system diagnosed with hydatid disease. METHODS A longitudinal retrospective study was conducted between 2003 and 2012 on hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of hydatidosis (ICD 122.0-122.9) in hospitals of the public health service of Extremadura. RESULTS During the period of study, 876 patients were diagnosed with hydatid disease. Of these 536 (61%) of cases were male, with a mean age of 65.53±17.8 years. More importantly, 19 (2.2%) of patients were 19 years old, with 17 cases between 2003-2007 versus 2 cases between 2008-2012 (OR=7.83; 95%CI: 1.79-34.11; P=.001). A total of 141 (16.0%) were younger than 45 years. The primary diagnosis was most frequently reported in the younger population &lt;45 years, whereas the secondary diagnosis was usually found in the elderly population &gt;70 years (P&lt;.05). The incidence rate of hydatid disease obtained from Hospital Discharge Records (HDRs) was significantly higher compared to the incidence that was declared in the Notifiable Disease System of Extremadura (8.02 cases per 10(5) person-years vs. 1.88 cases per 10(5) person-years [P&lt;.05]). CONCLUSION In Extremadura hydatid disease is still frequent. With a clear decrease in the number of paediatric cases. The number of cases obtained from HDRs regarding Notification System Diseases Extremadura suggests the need for modifications to improve surveillance and control of hydatid disease.</dc:description>
