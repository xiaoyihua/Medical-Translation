<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ongoing immunization campaigns have significantly reduced the incidence of measles. To evaluate the efficacy of vaccination policies, however, it is necessary to analyze disease indicators of mortality and of morbidity such as medical complications and sequelae. We reviewed the hospital experience at Hospital Infantil de Mexico regarding children with measles who necessitated hospitalization between January 1976 and December 1989. During this 14 year period, 176 patients with measles were hospitalized; the majority of the cases corresponded to the period between 1985 and 1989. Fifty five percent of the cases corresponded to children under one year of age. Of those older than 12 months, 81% lacked an immunization history. Eighty percent were from Mexico city or from the neighboring state of Mexico. The mayor complications included: respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia (50.8%), diarrhea (18.2%), and less frequent: laringotracheitis, otitis media, myocarditis and pyodermitis. More than 70% were significantly (grade II or III) malnourished. Twenty three patients died, for a mortality of 13%. The factors more likely related to measles mortality were; age less than two years, undernutrition, and more than two medical complications associated. This report emphasizes that medical complications and mortality are more likely to occur in very young unimmunized, malnourished children.</dc:description>
