<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report a 29 years old female presenting with fever and painful infiltrated erythematous and violaceous plates with pseudo vesicles in the surface, located in both arms, four days after having suffered a tonsillitis. She was admitted with the diagnosis of Sweet syndrome and the lesions disappeared spontaneously. Two months later, she presented with a similar condition, again after an upper respiratory infection. Five months later, she was admitted with arthralgias with positive rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies. Three years after the first admission, she was admitted with an acute glomerulonephritis and renal failure after another upper respiratory infection. Sweet syndrome was described in 1964 and, although initially considered benign, its association with inflammatory diseases or cancer has been reported.</dc:description>
