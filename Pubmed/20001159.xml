<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE Acquired chronic hepatocerebral degeneration, acquired hepatolenticular degeneration or pseudo-Wilson is an infrequent disorder with a hepatic origin. Cases in the literature are scarce and it is frequently confused with hepatic encephalopathy and Wilson s disease. The aim of this essay is to report a patient suffering from this disorder due to cirrhosis from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. CASE REPORT We present a 54-year-old man diagnosed from cirrhosis grade B9 of the Child Pugh classification. He progressively developed a picture with bradylalia, mild postural and action tremor and spatial and temporal disorientation. Further studies demonstrated an increase of the values of hepatic transaminases and a hyperintensity in the basal nuclei in the cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical and radiological data established the diagnosis of hepatocerebral degeneration. CONCLUSIONS Acquired chronic hepatocerebral degeneration is a disorder rarely reported in the literature that it is usually confused with other diseases. We alert about the need of having this diagnosis into account with patients developing neurological symptoms after hepatic disease.</dc:description>
