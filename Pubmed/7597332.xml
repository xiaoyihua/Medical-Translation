<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ischemic stroke constitute a mayor cause of morbidity and mortality in the adult population, particularly in the elderly. Heart disease may predispose to ischemic stroke, especially in the presence of transient or permanent precipitating factors such as atrial fibrillation. To elucidate the role of heart disease in predisposing to ischemic stroke we studied the clinical and non invasive cardiac profile (EKG, 2D-Echo, Holter) of 186 consecutive patients, 91 of them embolic (GI) and 96 non embolic (lacunar, atherothrombotic, others) (GII), as determined by brain CT scan and thorough clinical evaluation. Age and male/female ratio were significantly different (71 + 13 vs 65 + 12 years, 40/60 vs 65/35, p &lt; 0.003). Hypertension was equally common in both groups (38 and 40%). Patients in GI had higher prevalence of valvular heart disease (23 vs 1%), atrial fibrillation (67 vs 10%), 2D Echo left atrial enlargement (45 vs 16%) and supraventricular ectopy in Holter (59 vs 32%) p &lt; 0,001. By contrast absence of heart disease (45 vs 19%), ST-T changes in EKG (28 vs 14%), left ventricular hypertrophy in 2D Echo (28 vs 9%) and ventricular ectopy in Holter (54 vs 23%) were more prevalent in GII patients, p &lt; 0.001. Multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis showed age &gt; 70 years (relative risk (RR) 1.67), valvular heart disease (RR 2.25), chronic AF (RR 2.44) and paroxysmal AF (RR 1.89) were significant independent predictors of embolic stroke, whereas the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy in 2D-Echo (RR 0.76) and frequent ventricular premature beats in Holter (RR 0.47) were predictors of occlusive non embolic stroke. Thus, the clinical and non invasive cardiac profile of embolic and non embolic ischemic stroke is significantly different, which is relevant to preventive strategies.</dc:description>
