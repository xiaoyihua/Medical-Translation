METHODOLOGY It is a prospective study, with a duration of one year, in a real sample with 119 patients randomized as a stratified sample from the population attended after their intent. Data recollection was made with a psychiatric semi-structured interview and Beck's letality and suicidal intent scales. Recruitment and follow-up periods were one year long for each of them. Statistical analysis was realized with the chi square test and Fischer's exact test to evaluate associations among cualitative variable and the variance analysis of the relations between qualitative and quantitative variable. RESULTS Suicide intent ratio was 82/100,000 inhabitants, being in 83% by medicament ingestion. 71% were women, 66% were between 15 and 30 years old, 50% were unmarried and 12% were separated. 33% suffered from a affective disorder, and 23% were alcohol abusers. 6% of them bad a psycotic disorder. 52% of the patients had previous psychiatric disorders and 43% had been in treatment. 46% of them had someone in their families with a psychiatric disorder. 29% were repeaters after a previous attempt. Concerning to a prior contact with the Mental Health Services in the preceding month Significant differences were observed by age, but no significant differences were observed by sex. 26% used alcohol prior to the intent, mainly men.
