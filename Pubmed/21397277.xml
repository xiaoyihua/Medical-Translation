<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE To assess changes in renal function in a cohort of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and describe which factors are associated with deterioration. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a prospective transversal study. The follow-up period was 12 months. Data were collected at baseline and one year including the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We analyzed epidemiological data, comorbidities, CD4 lymphocytes, viral load, and AIDS status. RESULTS A total of 365 patients. Three hundred and thirteen (85%) were under highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART); the median CD4 was 606 ± 314 and the CV was undetectable in 85%. At 1-year, we found a mean deterioration in the GFR of 9.7 ml/h. Eighty patients (21.8%) had a fall in GFR &gt; 10 ml/h, while in 20 patients (5.8%) it was &gt; 30 ml/h. An association was found regarding age, treatment with didanosine (DDI) and males (OR 1.89 95% CI 1.3 to 4.08, OR 2.3 95% CI 1.9 to 23 and OR 3.47 95% CI 1.6 to 14.20 respectively). We found a protective role of being under HAART (OR 0.54, 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.8). CONCLUSIONS There was a protective role of HAART in the deterioration of GFR of patients with HIV infection. Male gender, age and use of DDI were associated with worsening renal function. Tenofovir and protease inhibitors were not associated with further deterioration of renal function.</dc:description>
