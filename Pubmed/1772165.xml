<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report a retrospective study of 51 children who presented urolithiasis between 1980 and 1989 in our Hospital. Mean age was 7 years and the male:female ratio was 2. 1:1. A positive family history was found in 60% of cases. It was done metabolic evaluation in every case: hypercalciuria was found in 34% of cases. In 6% of cases there were hyperuricosuria. None of our patients presented hyperoxaluria, cystinuria or hypocitraturia. Abdominal echography was the most sensible an specific imaging technique of diagnosis. In 16 cases it was necessary a surgical procedure although most cases received only medical management. Four patients were treated with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy. We emphasize the importance of metabolic evaluation. We report our own protocol of study and results.</dc:description>
