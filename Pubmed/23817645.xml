<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of the study was to investigate biofilm formation in Gram negative bacteria and to quantify biofilm production applying a new developed technique that made possible to compare results about biofilm formation within the different Gram negative bacteria species. A total of 153 Gram negative strains corresponding to 12 different bacterium species were studied applying a variation of the optic density measurement technique reported by Stepanovic et al. Data obtained with optic density analysis allow to classify microorganisms in strong biofilm developers, moderate biofilm developers, weak biofilm developers and no biofilm developers. The results were expressed in two ways, using in both cases the same statistical method: without standardization, where controls were different depending on the day optic density measurements were performed, and standardized using a correction factor, using the same control for every strain of all our bacterium species in our study, which allows result homogenization. The obtained results in our study after data analysis and standardization show that over the 153 Gram negative strains in our study, 105 of them were no biofilm developers, representing 63.75% of all the studied bacterium genera. We consider that standardization and quantification of biofilm development in Gram negative bacteria can be useful in clinical practice, because biofilm development ability can lead or focus the gold treatment of pathologies produced by these microorganisms.</dc:description>
