<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Protease inhibitors, boceprevir and telaprevir, have changed the treatment paradigm of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The objective is analyzing the degree of compliance with the recommendations for boceprevir and telaprevir use that have been issued for the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products in patients with CHC on a tertiary hospital. METHOD All patients who started treatment with triple therapy between March and September 2012 were included. Compliance the initiation criteria were assessed and whether the rules of discontinuation due to ineffectiveness were made. RESULTS 76 patients, 24 treated with boceprevir and 52 with telaprevir were included. In 11 patients (14.5%) triple therapy was initiated without keeping the Spanish Agency criteria, 6 were monoinfected patients and 4 with liver transplantation. In the group of boceprevir viral load (VL) at 12th week of treatment in 19 patients was measured (79.2%) and in 13 patients at 24th week (61.9 %). For telaprevir VL at week 4 the in 48 patients was determined (92.3%), at week 12 in 45 (91.8%) and at week 24 in 42 patients (93.3%). In all patients that the VL was determined its outcome was linked with the treatment continuation or not. CONCLUSIONS In most patients (80.3%) start and suspension requirements for triple therapy were kept. There is leeway for action and improvement that requires the involvement of all the acting agents.</dc:description>
