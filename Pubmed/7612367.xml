<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to compare the cost of laparoscopic cholecystectomy with that of open cholecystectomy. DESIGN We analyzed the cost of both procedures regarding hospital stay, days of work lost and the cost derived from the morbidity of the complications of each technique in two groups of patients. With these data we were able to calculate direct and indirect costs of both procedures and compare them. RESULTS Morbidity was similar in both groups and had no influence in the cost; cost of the material used for laparoscopic cholecystectomy was higher; hospital stay and days of lost work were significantly lower for the laparoscopic procedure than for the open one. The total cost of laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 23% cheaper than that of open cholecystectomy. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to be cheaper than open cholecystectomy. As the laparoscopic technique becomes more widespread its cost might decrease even further.</dc:description>
