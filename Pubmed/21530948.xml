<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Robotic-assisted surgery is playing an increasingly important role in the last few years in the treatment of colorectal oncological disease. However, there are still no studies that objectively demonstrate the advantages of this type of surgery. We present a prospective randomised study in order to compare the short-term results between colorectal robotic surgery and laparoscopic surgery. MATERIAL AND METHOD A total of 56 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between January 2008 and January 2009, were randomised and assigned to the robotic or laparoscopic group. Age, body mass index, tumour location, conversions in each group, complications during and after surgery, and histological characteristics of the specimens obtained, were all compared. RESULTS There were no significant differences between age (P=.055), body mass index (P=.12), or tumour location (P=.91). Only one patient in the robotic group required a transfusion and none in the laparoscopic group. The percentage of conversions was the same in both groups, however, the preparation times and operating times were significantly longer in patients intervened using the robotic device (P=.0001 and P=.017, respectively). There were no differences as regards the rate of complications or in the percentage of re-interventions (14.2% and 7.1%). The mean hospital stay of the patients was 9.3 (8.1) days in the robotic group and 9.2 (6.8) days in the laparoscopic (P=.79). The distal resection margin was greater in the specimen obtained using robotic surgery (P =.003) as well as the number of lymph nodes obtained in the specimen (P =.23). CONCLUSION Robotic colorectal was performed safely and effectively, and with similar clinical results. International Trial Number for this study is: ISRCTN60866560.</dc:description>
