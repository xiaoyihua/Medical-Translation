<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Artery embolization (AE) is a safe and useful procedure in the management of massive hemoptysis. The objective of our study was to describe the experience of AE in a tertiary referral center, to characterize angiographic findings at the time of recurrence, and to analyze factors associated with these findings. MATERIAL AND METHODS Observational retrospective study of patients presenting with life-threatening hemoptysis. All consecutive patients with at least one episode of hemoptysis that required AE during a 13-year period were included. The effects of i)time to recurrence; ii)use of coils, and iii)number of arteries embolized on the likelihood that the recurrence was secondary to recanalization were assessed. RESULTS One hundred seventy-six patients were included in the study. Twenty-two patients (12.5%) died due to hemoptysis. Probability of recurrence-free survival at one month was 0.91 (95%CI: 0.87 to 0.95), at 12months was 0.85 (95%CI: 0.79 to 0.91), and after 3 years was 0.75 (95%CI: 0.66 to 0.83). A longer time to recurrence was associated with a higher probability that the hemorrhage affected the same artery (estimate=0.0157, z-value=2.41, p-value=0.016). CONCLUSION AE is a safe and useful technique in the management of massive and recurrent hemoptysis. Nevertheless, recurrence after embolization is not uncommon. Recurring hemoptysis due to recanalization is related to time to recurrence, but not to the use of coils or number of arteries embolized.</dc:description>
