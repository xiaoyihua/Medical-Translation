<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since 2007, there are international guidelines for implementation and interpretation of spirometry in preschool children. A percentage of these patients cannot obtain maneuvers that meet all eligibility criteria. The objective of this study was to develop a quality scale for interpreting these partially acceptable spirometry. MATERIAL AND METHOD Delphi methodology was used, which allows to reach consensus among experts analyzing a defined problem. We invited to participate pediatric pneumologists dedicated to lung function and who participated actively in scientific specialty societies in Chile. Successive rounds were conducted with questionnaires about criteria used to assess spirometry in preschool children. These criteria define the acceptability of spirometric maneuvers according to international guidelines. Proposed quality grades were &#147;very good&#148;, &#147;good&#148;, &#147;fair&#148; and &#147;bad&#148;. RESULTS Thirteen of the 15 invited experts accepted our invitation. In the first round 9 disagreed with the degree of &#147;regular&#148; quality. In the second round this was removed and 11 experts answered, 9 of them agreed with the use of this new version. The most contentious criterion was the end of expiration. CONCLUSION Most experts agreed with the final scale, using &#147;very good&#148;, &#147;good&#148; and &#147;bad&#148; judgments. This would help to improve the performance of spirometry in children between 2 and 5 years.</dc:description>
