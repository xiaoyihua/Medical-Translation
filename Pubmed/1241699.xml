<dc:description xml:lang="en">A new case of hereditary acrokeratotic poikiloderma of Weary is presented by the authors. There was no eczematoid dermatitis and the patient was the only member of the family affected. There were similarities with the cases published by Piñol Aguadé and co-workers. The authors suggest that this disease can appear in two forms; a complete form (Weary type) and an incomplete form (Piñol type). The histology of the keratotic lesions is reported for the first time. The lesions are very similar in the 15 cases published up to 1975, and the authors believe that it constitutes a well defined entity.</dc:description>
