<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE We report our experience during the past 10 years in the management of accidental punctures. PATIENTS AND METHODS A study was made of all hypodermic needle punctures recorded in children aged 0-14 years in our center since 1987. A clinical protocol consisting of 5 visits and duration of 6-7 months was used in all cases. RESULTS A total of 150 punctures were recorded during the study period with a decrease in prevalence over time. All cases the clinical protocol was accepted and correct follow-up procedures were performed. In no case was post-puncture sero-conversion detected for HCV, HBV, or HIV among correctly immunized children. CONCLUSIONS The protocol employed is useful and well accepted with the risk of infection caused by accidental puncture being remote provided initial patient care was adequate.</dc:description>
