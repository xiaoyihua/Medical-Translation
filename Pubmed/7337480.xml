<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thirty-five patients with an average overweight of 67.1% were studied. Pulmonary restriction of a variable degree was found in 68.6/; in 60% due to reduction of respiratory reserve volume. Bronchial obstruction was detected in 57% as measured by forced midexpiratory flow (25-75%). In addition, 14% showed a decrease of 75-85% in forced expiratory flow, which suggested that the pathology was located in the small respiratory airways. The PaO2 while breathing room air and in a resting state was of 52.6 +/- 9.42 mmHg, and after breathing it increased to 69.07 +/- 11.01 mmHg. The PaO2 breathing inspiratory fractions of 99.6% O2 in a resting condition was 309.34 +/- 70.07 mmHg, and after deep breathing it rose to 354.0 +/- 64.27 mmHg. The mechanisms which produce hypoxemia in the obese were analysed and it was concluded that they were due fundamentally to alterations of the ventilation perfusion ratio and to an increase of the venous-arterial shunt. In some cases, alveolar hypoventilation contributed (Pickwick syndrome). By increasing the pulmonary volume with deep breathing, the ventilation perfusion ratio improves or becomes normal, likewise, the venous-arterial shunt can improve or persist as the only cause of hypoxemia.</dc:description>
