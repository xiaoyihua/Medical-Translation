<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this article we examine the role of the family in the provision of social support by studying the identity of persons which the participants consider available for providing support. We define social support as that human relationship in which socio-emotional (closeness, intimacy counseling), instrumental (goods and services) and recreational (companionship for recreation) resources are interchanged. Based on a probabilistic sample of the adult (17-68 yrs.) population, 912 persons were successfully interviewed (response rate = 90.4%) using a structured interview schedule. Results indicate that close relatives (parents, brothers/sisters, sons/daughters) are the main resource of all types of support, not only of the general population but also of specific demographic groups defined by their gender, age (17-39, 40-68) and schooling (0-11, 12 + yrs). The marital partner was also identified as an important support resource, especially emotional and recreational; more distant relatives were also important for providing instrumental support. Although the compared groups showed many similarities, they also differed in various aspects both when individually and jointly analyzed. It is concluded that the family is very important in the provision of social support in Puerto Rico (PR).</dc:description>
