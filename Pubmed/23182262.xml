<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND local estrogen treatments have been used for vaginal dryness management. The objective was to determine the maturation index (MI) and vaginal dryness after the treatment with topic conjugated estrogens (TCE) in low and conventional doses in Mexican women. METHODS postmenopausal women that received vaginal TCE cream. Group I Low-dose which received 0.5 g of TCE twice a week and Group II Conventional-dose with one g of TCE twice a week. The MI was determined and estrogenic value (EV) was calculated. Vaginal dryness was evaluated with an analog visual scale, and vaginal humidity by the moistening of a pH test strip measured in millimeters. Statistical analysis with Student's t test for independent and paired samples was done. RESULTS 27 women were studied, group I (n = 13), group II (n = 14). There weren't any differences in the analyzed parameters. Both treatments increased the MI and decreased the vaginal dryness. CONCLUSIONS low and conventional dose of TCE had similar effect in vaginal scope in Mexican women.</dc:description>
