<dc:description xml:lang="en">The physician Julián Gutiérrez de Toledo, born in the Imperial Town halfway through the Fifteenth Century and deceased around 1520, has a great relevance in the History of Urology for being the first writer of a treatise on urological topics in the Castilian language with his work "Cure of the stone and loin pain or/and renal colic" (Editor Melchor Gorricio, Printer Pedro de Hagembach, Toledo 1498). His work marks the transit from The Middle Ages to the Modern Times in what refers to awareness of the urinary tract diseases. The book "Cure of the stone..." has 85 pages written in two columns of 40 lines each with gothic characters. On the cover there is an engraving of the saint physicians Cosme and Damian, and on the last page is the printer's coat-of-arms. The book consists of five parts as all books from late Middle Ages: Of the Causes, Signs and Prognosis, Preservation, Of the Cure, Misgivings. The value of the treaty is that it compiles all that was known at the time on urinary lithiasis showing a marked Avicenna-like Galenism to which the author adds his own observations that show the Renaissance man. An exceptional witness of the reign of the Catholic King and Queen, this incunabular should be known by the Spanish speaking urologist as illustrious predecessor.</dc:description>
