<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Retrospective review of the clinical and functional results and the degree of satisfaction of patients with osteochondral talar lesions treated with arthroscopic debridement, curettage and microfractures at our center. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 2008 and December 2011, a total of 30 patients with osteochondral talar lesions were seen. They all had failed conservative treatment and underwent arthroscopic debridement, curettage and microfractures. The data analyzed included etiology, location and size of the lesion, and lesion grade according to the Berndt &amp; Hardy classification. The functional clinical assessment was done using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society classification and the visual analog scale. The degree of satisfaction was assessed using a simple survey. Associated lesions, complications and reoperations were also recorded. RESULTS Mean follow-up was 12 months; mean age was 43 years. The main cause was trauma (10/30 patients). Mean size of lesions was 0.86 cm2. The mean American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score was 92 and the visual analog scale dropped from 7 to 1. All patients were satisfied with the treatment they received. No complications or reoperations were recorded. CONCLUSIONS Osteochondral talar lesions in patients over 40 years of age have specific characteristics and the results of arthroscopic treatment are similar to those seen in the younger population.</dc:description>
