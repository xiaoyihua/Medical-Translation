<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (PTC) evaluates the requests for off-label uses with an abbreviated report format. The aim of this study is to perform a descriptive analysis of this activity and to study the rate of approvals. MATERIAL AND METHODS A descriptive study was performed on the PTC reports in a tertiary hospital between September 2009 and April 2011. The type of drug by treatment group and by type of dispensing, indication and requesting department was analysed. The final decision adopted was studied as the primary outcome, and the percentage of requests approved according to the characteristics of the drug evaluated, indication requested, alternatives used, evidence and cost, as secondary outcomes. RESULTS A total of 51 applications were analysed, of which 60.8% were drugs for hospital use and 54.9% cytostatic. The most requested indications were the onco-haematological (43.2%) and autoimmune (35.3%). Haematology was the department that made most requests (11 requests with 72.7% approved), Oncology and Paediatrics (both with 10 requests, with 50% approved). Almost two-thirds (60.8%) of the requests were approved. Of those that were not approved, 11 had not used up the therapeutic alternatives, and 8 had no evidence. Just under half (47.1%) of the drugs requested had a cost/patient between 10,000-100,000 euros,of which 58.3% were approved (cost per course of treatment if it had a defined period, or cost of treatment per year for chronic treatment). CONCLUSION There is an increase in the activity of the PTC that is growing over the years. Most applications focus on drugs for hospital use and cytostatic drugs by Onco-haematology. There is a high rate of approval by the PTC, and high variability in the percentage of approval depending on the department and the evidence of use. The difference between approved and unapproved requests followed a logic of cost-effectiveness.</dc:description>
