<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Periodic intra-access blood flow rate (QA) monitoring is the preferred method for vascular access (VA) surveillance (NKF-K/DOQI, update 2000). OBJECTIVES 1) To determine the ultrafiltration (UF) method accuracy for early detection of VA stenosis. 2) To evaluate the hemodynamic effect of elective VA intervention (angioplasty or surgery). 3) To define the impact of periodic QA monitoring using the UF method combined by elective VA intervention on VA thrombosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS We prospectively monitored QA during hemodialysis (HD) in 65 ESRD (mean age 64.9 +/- 11.4 years, 20% diabetes) patients over 1 year period. All patients undergoing HD in the Hospital de Mollet by arteriovenous fistula (89.2%) or graft 10.8%. QA was measured at least every 4 months by the UF method using the Crit Line III Monitor. Fifty (77%) patients were included at the beginning of the study period and the remaining 15 (23%) were added later when they started HD. All patients with absolute QA &lt;700 ml/min or decreased &gt;20% from baseline met criteria of positive evaluation (PE) and were referred for angiography (AG) plus subsequent preventive intervention (angioplasty or surgery) if VA stenosis &gt;50%. We also studied 94 not QA monitored patients since the beginning of the study period (mean age 64.6 +/- 13.7 years; 12.8% diabetes) that undergoing HD simultaneous in the Institut Nefrològic Granollers. RESULTS We performed 200 QA measurements in 509 months of follow-up. The overall mean QA was 1176.7 +/- 491.8 ml/min (range, 380.5-2904.0 ml/min). Three patients (4.6%) thrombosed VA. Nineteen (29.2%) patients had PE; none of them clotted VA. The AG was performed in 84.2% (16/19) patients with PE and all of them (16/16) showed VA stenosis &gt; or =50%; 31.2% (5/16) were lost to follow-up (3 death, 2 transplantation); of the remaining explored patients (11/16), 72.7% (8/11) underwent intervention (3 angioplasty, 5 surgery). The mean QA increased from 577.2 +/- 108.2 ml/min to 878.1 +/- 264.4 ml/min postintervention (p=0.005). The positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity of UF method for VA stenosis were 84.2%, 93.5%, 84.2% and 93.5%, respectively. VA thrombosis rate in our 50 beginners QA monitored patients (mean age 64.5 +/- 1 1.4 years; 20% diabetes) was lower (2/50, 4%) compared to 94 not QA monitored patients (16/94, 17%) (p=0.024). CONCLUSIONS 1) QA monitoring using the UF method allows an early diagnosis of VA stenosis. 2) Serial QA measurement by UF method can be used in assessing the functional response to corrective VA intervention. 3) Periodic VA surveillance by QA measurements using the UF method combined with elective intervention results in reduced VA thrombosis.</dc:description>
