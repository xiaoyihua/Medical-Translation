<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED In 1992 the radiofrequency ablation program was started, with very good results in patients with supraventricular tachycardias and normal hearts or minimal structural defects. Nevertheless, the results are not as good for the patients with structural defects, that are actually seen more frequently, those are cases with more complex arrhythmias, are patients with cardiac surgery that show a complex arrhythmogenic substrate or patients previously treated with conventional ablation which tachycardia recurs. In these cases, the electroanatomic Carto system has been very useful. RESULTS In the last two years, 74 procedures with the Carto system were performed, of which 56 have been supraventricular arrhythmias, improving substantially the success rates CONCLUSIONS The electroanatomical mapping allows the more accurate identification of the arrhythmogenic substrate, achieving better success rates in recurrent tachycardia after conventional ablation, or in cases with more complex arrhythmogenic substrates.</dc:description>
