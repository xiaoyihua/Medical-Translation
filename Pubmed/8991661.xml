<dc:description xml:lang="en">A case of cholestasis in a young patient with portal cavernomatosis is reported. This clinical picture is very infrequent and appears as a consequence of extrinsic compression on the common bile duct due to which the derivative venous collaterals. There does not appear to be any relationship between the intensity of the morphologic alteration of the biliary tract and the level of portal hypertension and the degree of extrahepatic obstruction. Diagnosis was fundamentally achieved by arteriography and retrograde cholangiography with differential diagnosis with the previously mentioned diseases being required. Chronic cholestasis advises derivative surgery in which difficulties may be found due to the presence of thick collaterals in the hepatic pedicle as occurred in this patient.</dc:description>
