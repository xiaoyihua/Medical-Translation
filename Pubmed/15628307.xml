<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Instituto de Investigaciones Cardiológicas (ININCA) was founded by Alberto C. Taquini in 1944 and directed by him during more than 50 years, until his death in 1998. The Institute was (and still is) dedicated to research in connection with CONICET (National Research Council) and to teaching within the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires. From the very beginning research was centered on hypertension, hypoxia and hemodynamic adaptations, renal physiology and electrolytes, arterial wall, cardiac metabolism, myocardial pharmacology and regulation of the circulation by the central nervous system. On the basis of Taquini's autobiographical notes, the experiments are reported which eventually led to the discovery of hypertensin, angiotensin and their relation with renin, together with the discussions promoted by the diverse hypotheses proposed by both national and international groups of investigators as the mechanism of hypertension. Taquini also played an important role in promoting science at national levels including his role as the first Secretary of Science and Technology from 1968 to 1971. He believed that scientific research is something more than planning and producing, that it also involves creating knowledge. As such he made many contributions to science, formed many disciples, and directed an Institute which is demonstrating its continuity.</dc:description>
