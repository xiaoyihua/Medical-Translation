<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the year 1817, Charlotte daughter of Georges IV and princess of Wales, died on an unknown condition with uteroplacental hemorrhage and fetal death called at the time "Uteroplacental Apoplexy" and later "Abruptio Placentae". This affection was described in the classical books as an hemorrhagic complication of labor. In 1961 we have at first related the Abruptio with acute toxemia (preeclampsia) and have proposed the term "Gestosis hemorrágica" to design it. In 1982 Weinstein has described the called HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated liver Enzymes, at Low Platelets) which basically is the same pathological picture as the described by us as "hemorrhagic toxemia". The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the identity of both syndromes and to claim for the priority of our definition.</dc:description>
