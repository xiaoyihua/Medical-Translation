<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Presentation of 8 patients with subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas (SGCA) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). MATERIAL AND METHODS There are 8 patients, 6 males and 2 females with TSC, who presented with the tumour between the neonatal period and 24 years. RESULTS All patients showed bilateral hypersignalised areas in zones close to the foramen of Monro. Three of the patients were admitted urgently due to blindness and increased intracranial pressure. Incomplete removal of the tumour has always been bad solution as it resulted in the death of the patient (in one case) or further surgery operation in the short term. Only one patient developed the tumour suddenly from pre-existing subependymal nodules from the childhood and they had to be removed at 24 years of age. By contrast, 32 patients with TSC and images of subependymal nodules whose CT or MR progress was followed up for between 10 and 30 years did not develop a tumour. One patient had to be operated four times over 20 years. CONCLUSIONS SGCA associated with TSC is a severe complication which as likely to develop and careful monitoring is required from neonatal age with periodicclinical and imaging studies in order to avoid its irreversible complications. Hydrocephaly, blindness and even the death can be the main consequences. Reintervention of the recurrent tumour is often necessary.</dc:description>
