<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective To determine and compare with reports in the bibliography, the prevalence of temporomandibular disorders with an instrument validated for Mexican children with mixed dentition. Methods 150 children, from 8 to 12 years of age and of any sex who attended the pediatric stomatology clinic of the BUAP (Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla) were included and evaluated with the diagnostic criteria for research on TTM (CDI/TTM) by a researcher who had been previously standardized (kappa=0.93). The results contrasted with reports in the bibliography. Results The prevalence of TTM was 20.7%. It was predominantly muscular (77.4%), though 33.3% showed alteration of the mouth-opening pattern, 34% showed joint noises (clicks). The most compromised mandibular function was chewing (6%). These results contrast with reports in the bibliography, specifically in terms of muscle pain sites and headaches, probably explained by different instruments used. Conclusion The prevalence of TTM is in contrast among different studies. It is necessary to place emphasis on the need to evaluate these factors during the childhood and adolescence with validated instruments.</dc:description>
