<dc:description xml:lang="en">Vasodilator therapy has been utilized for the treatment of congestive heart failure in the last 20 years. These drugs contribute to increase cardiac output, decrease peripheral vascular resistance and favour venous dilatation. Recent multicenter trials have addressed the issue of the impact of vasodilator therapy upon survival. Thus, the VHEFT-I and Consensus studies have shown that both the combination of nitrates and hydralazine and ACF inhibitors improve life expectancy in patients with moderate and severe heart failure. Moreover, the SOLVD study showed that ACE inhibitors improve survival and reduce cardiac events in patients with mild heart failure and depressed myocardial function at the end of 2 years of follow-up. The VHEFT II trial compared the effects of the nitrate-hydralazine combination versus ACE inhibitors upon the clinical course of patients with moderate heart failure. This last trial showed that although nitrates and hydralazine exerted a slightly better benefit upon exercise tolerance and left ventricular ejection fraction, patients that were treated with ACE inhibitors had a significantly reduced mortality. Differences in mortality when both groups of vasodilators drugs were compared were due to reduction of arrhythmias and sudden death. It is likely that this greater benefit obtained with ACE inhibitors when compared to nitrates and hydralazine in heart failure might be due to their favourable effects upon the abnormal neurohormonal activation observed in this syndrome. Thus ACE inhibitors have turned out to be one of the cornerstones in the treatment of congestive heart failure.</dc:description>
