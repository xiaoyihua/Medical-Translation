<dc:description xml:lang="en">The publication of the Treaty of Urology of Francisco Díaz towards the end of the sixteenth Century, was a milestone in the History of medicine. The originality and precociousness of his doctrine entailed a true revolution in the genesis of medicosurgical literature, considering that the text constitutes an inspired anticipation to the specialization age. Ever since the last century, all historians and annotators of this work have asked themselves whether there was an earlier edition to that of 1588 since the title "Newly printed treaty ..." invites such a inference. So far, every investigation searching for the original or a copy of the first edition have been in vain. This paper, based on documents and old works from the Archive of Protocols in Madrid, Library of the Royal Palace and Library of El Escorial Monastery, reveals certain data until now unpublished on the destiny of most of the copies belonging to the second edition presented and brings into light old references on which account is given that the original "Treaty of Urology" by Francisco Díaz, considered to be a Sixteenth Century Codex was lost in the fire of the El Escorial Monastery in 1671.</dc:description>
