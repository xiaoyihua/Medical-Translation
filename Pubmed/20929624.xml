<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine if the anatomical vascular variations of the renal allograft affect kidney function after a transplant surgery. METHODS Patients that received kidney transplantation in a period of six years were included. The anatomical vascular variations of the allograft, techniques for reconstruction, outcomes in kidney function and surgical vascular complications were investigated and a comparison between the group with multiple renal arteries (MRA) and the group with a single (SRA) renal artery was performed. RESULTS In a period of six years 477 kidney transplants were performed; 22.8% (109) presented MRA of the allograft. In these patients, an anastomosis for two, three, or four arteries was performed. Fifteen percent (72) presented multiple veins. The mean serum creatinine at day seven and three years later were 1.32 and 1.43 mg/dL respectively for the group with MRA; for the group with SRA 1.2 and 1.38 mg/dL respectively. Vascular surgical complications occurred in 2.48% (4) in the group with MRA and in 1.2% (2) in the group with SRA. CONCLUSIONS There is no difference in kidney function and incidence of surgical vascular complications between both groups.</dc:description>
