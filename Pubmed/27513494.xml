<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Mutation analysis has identified a G-&gt; A transition in the promoter region of TNF-alpha gene at position -308 (rs1800629). OBJECTIVE The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of polymorphism in -308 GA promoter variant of the TNF alpha gene on metabolic response and weight loss secondary to two hypocaloric diets. METHOD A sample of 283 obese subjects was enrolled in a consecutive prospective way. In the basal visit, patients were randomly allocated during 9 months to diet HP (high protein/low carbohydrate hypocaloric diet) and diet S (standard hypocaloric diet). RESULTS There were no significant differences between the positive effects on weight loss in either genotype group with both diets. With both diets and only in wild genotype (diet HP vs. diet S), total cholesterol (-9.1 ± 3.4 mg/dL vs. -6.9 ± 2.0 mg/dL; p &gt; 0.05), LDL cholesterol (-9.0 ± 2.9 mg/dL vs. -6.5 ± 2.1 mg/dL; p &gt; 0.05) and triglycerides (-23.1 ± 5.1 mg/dL vs. -12.3 ± 4.8 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.05) decreased. The improvement in triglycerides was higher in subjects without A allele. With diet HP and only in wild genotype, insulin levels (-3.1 ± 1.8 UI/L; p &lt; 0.05) and HOMA-R (-0.8 ± 0.1 units; p &lt; 0.05) decreased. CONCLUSION Carriers of -308 GG promoter variant of TNF-alpha gene have a better metabolic response than -308 GA obese with a high protein hypocaloric diet.</dc:description>
