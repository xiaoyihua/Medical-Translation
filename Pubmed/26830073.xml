<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Fontan operation is the final palliative stage of patients with univentricular hearts. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) decreases ventricular performance and increases pulmonary artery pressures in the post operative recovery period. It seems that Fontan operation performed without CPB decreases short term morbidity and intra hospitalary length of stay. OBJETIVE Compare outcome in Fontan patients who have undergone surgery with or without CPB. METHOD This is a retrospective review of patients undergoing Fontan operation from january 2009 to december 2012. Patients were grouped according to CPB use and comparative analyses were done. RESULTS Ten patients were operated without CPB use. There was a discrepancy between age in both groups, being younger in the no CPB group. Around 80% of patients in both groups had a staged procedure. A 18mm graft was used in half of the cases; a fenestration was created in all cases. Length of stay was equal in both groups, there was less need of pharmacologic support and nitric oxide use in patients without CPB use. No deaths were reported also in this group. At folllow up, most patients had a class i functional status. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, Fontan operation without CPB has similar outcomes compared with CPB use.</dc:description>
