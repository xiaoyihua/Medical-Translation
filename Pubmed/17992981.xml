<dc:description xml:lang="en">Costa Rica is not an exception in the prevalence of ochratoxin A in human plasma, in this research the presence of the micotoxin was found in 95% of the 149 samples studied. The presence of ocratoxina A also was studied in 110 samples of toasted and grounded coffee from the most important 12 coffee factories of the country and from 7 supermarkets. With the exception of one negative sample the rest of them have concentrations of micotoxin below 4000 ng/kg. An association between the coffee consumption and the presence of ochratoxin A in plasma was attempted to be found as well as in the consumption of beer, but there were any statistically significant difference in the average level of mycotoxin between the coffee consumers and non coffee consumers neither between beer consumers and no beer consumers.</dc:description>
