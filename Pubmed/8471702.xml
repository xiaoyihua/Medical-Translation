<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of rheumatic illnesses in the Principality of Asturias. DESIGN Crossover study, consisting of an interview and a medical examination, administered to 702 people selected in a random fashion, in line with multi-stage and proportional sampling. Validated criteria for the diagnosis of rheumatic pathology were applied. SETTING Urban and rural population throughout the Autonomous Community of the Principality of Asturias. RESULTS There was a 75.6% response (702 people). In these a 23.8% prevalence of arthrosis was found, with a significantly higher proportion among older people and women. The second most common condition was rheumatism in soft parts; and then lumbalgia, which predominates in middle age. Inflammatory arthropathies are much less common (2.5%) in the general population. 6.1% of the sample presented a rheumatic pathology that could not be adequately defined. CONCLUSIONS Rheumatic illnesses are extremely common among the general population. Arthrosis, rheumatism of the soft parts and lumbalgia are the most customary conditions. Their prevalence is much greater than that of inflammatory rheumatism.</dc:description>
