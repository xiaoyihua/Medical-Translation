<dc:description xml:lang="en">Several outbreaks of sheep mastitis by Aspergillus fumigatus in Castilla y Leon (Spain), were studied. Only sheep that were treated intramammarily with antibacterial antibiotics during the dry period suffered this mastitis. Mastitis was acute with a morbidity up to 14 % and mortality near 100 %. The udder was markedly enlarged in size, fibrotic, haemorrhagic and with multiple compact nodules, some with purulent material inside; after 30-50 days postpartum, cheesy abscess of several centimetres in diameter were present. Some sheep had granulomatous nodules in the lung. Microscopy and culture shown the presence of A. fumigatus in milk, udder and lung. The route of infection was by intramammary via as a consequence of unhygienic intramammary treatment in the dry period.</dc:description>
