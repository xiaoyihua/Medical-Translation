<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Given both the limited experience of Undergraduate Teaching in Primary Health Care (PHC) and the lack of contact between different teaching centres, we sought to identify the minimum contents of a potential Syllabus. We made a distinction between items of knowledge required and skills students would have to develop. DESIGN We undertook a Delphi study, which was longitudinal, prospective and observational. PARTICIPANTS We defined three groups of experts among groups with PHC teaching experience. 20 Associate Lecturers at Undergraduate level, attached to Health centres; 20 postgraduate PHC teachers, and 7 University staff members involved with Public Health and Preventive and Community Medicine teaching. MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS The reply rate from the three questionnaires was about 60%. There was a high level of agreement. Of the items of knowledge which scored highest, we noted: the doctor-patients relationship, the Promotion of Health and Health education, Integrated Health Programmes, Prevention of Disease and Care of Risk-Groups. Of the skills, we pointed to the Clinical Interview, the construction of a Clinical History at the PHC level, Detection of Risk factors and Physical Examination. CONCLUSIONS The most valued items of knowledge are those related to the overall Conception of Health, Promotion and Prevention. The most highly-scored skills are those concerning the Doctor-Patient relationship. Questions relating to the Individual are prioritised over those concerning Family and Community. There is a high level of agreement that the acquisition of the necessary theoretical knowledge must be accompanied by the ability to put them into practice.</dc:description>
