<dc:description xml:lang="en">It was conducted a descriptive study of the data available at the National Statistics Division of the Ministry of Public Health on the 397 deaths caused by leptospirosis in Cuba from 1987 to 1993. Data were tabulated according to age, sex, place of residence, death date, necropsy, and occupation on dying. The years of potential life lost by the age group 0-65 were calculated. In 1993, it was observed a rough increase of the rate that reached a value of 1.03 per 100,000 inhabitants. The highest rates were registered among those over 50. The high rate attained by males determined their general behavior. The incidence of this disease rose in October, November and June. The Isle of Youth special municipality and Las Tunas were the provinces with the greatest rates. The retired were the most affected followed by the factory and agricultural workers.</dc:description>
