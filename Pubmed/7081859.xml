<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hypoplasia of penis which is frequently associated with hipospadias is important when a surgical treatment of this malformation is to undertaken. The decision to increase the dimensions of the penis before surgery by means of hormone treatments is based on good surgical results obtained in very young patients with hypoplasia. The authors have conducted a study involving 76 boys with hipospadias over a period of four years. One group of 37 boys was treated with corionic gonadotrophines by injection during a period of eight weeks. The second group of 39 boys was treated with testosterone cream (2%) topically during one month. Measurements were taken before and after the treatments using four parameters, and the boys were separated according to age. The results showed a more favorable response to testosterone cream in comparison to the injections of corionic gonadotrophines.</dc:description>
