<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The Cox MAZE III operation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) is complex and consumes significant operative time. Cryoablation of the pulmonary veins (CPV) is a simpler alternative for patients that require concomitant valvular surgery. AIM To evaluate CPV in patients with AF submitted to valvular surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty one patients had simultaneous valvular surgery and CPV, 81 % of them had permanent AF for an average of 5 years. Twenty patients had mitral valve disease. The etiology was rheumatic in 14. Average left atrial diameter was 60 mm. In 7 patients the mitral valve was replaced, in 5 it was repaired, in 7 both mitral and aortic valve were replaced, in 1 the mitral valve was repaired and the aortic valve was replaced and in 1 only the aortic valve was replaced. A combined transeptal and superior approach was used for all patients. The CPV was performed after the valvular procedure with cryothermy at -60 degrees C for 2 minutes with two 15 mm cryoprobes applied simultaneously. RESULTS CPV increased surgical time by 10 to 20 minutes. Operative mortality was 4.8% (1 patient). One patient developed a pericardial effusion and another a complete heart block that required a permanent pacemaker. All patients improved their functional class. At the end of an average 10.5 months of follow-up, 50% of patients were in normal sinus rhythm and 25% persisted in AF. The remaining patients were in some type of regular rhythm. CONCLUSIONS CPV as a complementary procedure in patients with AF undergoing valvular surgery had good results to abate AF. It restored normal sinus rhythm in 50% of the cases, with low morbidity and mortality and little increment in surgical time.</dc:description>
