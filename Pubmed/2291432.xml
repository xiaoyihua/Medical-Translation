<dc:description xml:lang="en">"The Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly" (CAMDEX) is a new structured interview developed for diagnostic of dementia and other psychogeriatric disorders frequent in the old age. The CAMDEX is composed of three main sections: 1) A clinical interview structured to obtain from the patient a systematized information about his present condition, his antecedents and his familiar history. 2) A short neuropsychological battery formed by several cognitive tests. 3) A structured interview to obtain independent information about relative or another informing person about the present state of the patient, his antecedents and his familiar history. The good results obtained by the original version of CAMDEX, as in clinical works as in epidemiological ones, have determined their translation and fitting in our environment. The present work shows the changes that have been necessary to insert in the original version in order that this interview may be used in our geriatric population.</dc:description>
