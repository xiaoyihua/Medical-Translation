<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Medication errors occur because of pitfalls in one or more of the steps involved in the process of drug administration and should be considered as system errors. They should never be considered as human errors with assignment of responsibility. Rather, their causes should be analyzed to prevent repetition. The ultimate aim should be to improve working procedures to avoid these errors. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 122 prescriptions were prospectively analyzed, along with their corresponding transcription to the nursing notes. Their legibility, dose, units, route of administration, and administration interval were evaluated. Units per kilogram of body weight and the use of generic names were also recorded. RESULTS Prescription errors were detected in 35.2 % of the prescriptions reviewed. The most frequent errors were related to dosing (16.4 %). Analysis of the quality of the prescriptions revealed that 61.5 % of the drugs were prescribed by their generic name, but only 4.1 % specified the dose per kilogram of body weight. Errors were detected in 21.3 % of transcriptions, the most frequent being the absence of the administration route (7.4 %). The generic name was used in 57.4 % of the transcriptions. CONCLUSIONS In the busy and complex environment of neonatal units, medication errors can be frequent. However, most of these errors are trivial and do not harm patients. Medication errors are indicators of the quality of the healthcare provided. Therefore, their detection and systematic analysis of their causes can contribute to their systematic prevention, thus improving the healthcare delivery process.</dc:description>
