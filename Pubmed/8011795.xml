<dc:description xml:lang="en">The main clinical manifestations of aluminum toxicity include progressive encephalopathy, osteomalacia, microcytic hypochromic anemia, and cholestasis. The premature newborn receiving IV therapy are at high risk of such aluminium intoxication: two conditions predispose them to an aluminum overdose-parenteral exposure and their reduced kidney function. The amount of aluminum present as contaminant was calculated for each of the i.v. solutions used in the preparation of the parenteral nutrition units in pediatrics, along with that for three prepared nutritions. This was done using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The calcium salts (5.18 +/- 2.88(5)ppm), phosphorus salts (3.96 +/- 3.52(5)ppm) and trace elements (1.52 +/- 0.92(4) ppm) were the most contaminated components, the amount of aluminum being similar to that found by other authors showing bone and liver accumulations. The great variability between the solutions of different manufacturers and of different batches suggests that the contamination takes place during manufacture, so that it could in many cases be prevented by establishing adequate controls.</dc:description>
