<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Trichophyton tonsurans is a dermatophyte fungus that can cause ringworm outbreaks. In our health area in September 2013, two cases of T. tonsurans ringworm were diagnosed in children who lived in a Children's Centre. AIMS To determine the origin and extent of the outbreak. METHODS Mycological cultures of scalp and skin samples from the contacts of the diagnosed cases were performed, as well as environmental samples from the Children's Centre. The patients started with a treatment for their ringworm, and an environmental disinfection of the centre was performed. RESULTS Twelve cases of ringworm were detected, along with three asymptomatic scalp carriers of T. tonsurans among 20 children in the Centre. The index case was a resident in whose family, that had just returned from their country of origin, Nigeria, three cases of ringworm were diagnosed. From November 2013 to February 2014 another five cases of ringworm were diagnosed among schoolmates of three cases from the Children's Centre. CONCLUSIONS The antifungal treatment of the children resulted in the mycological and clinical resolution, and from February to November 2014 no other cases of ringworm by T. tonsurans in the same health area were diagnosed.</dc:description>
