<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex type I (HSV-1) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) are latent persistent infections. Their reactivation may cause illnesses and death in human immunodeficiency virus-infected (HIV) people. World wide seroprevalence of these viruses is over 50%. In Chile, information is not available. AIM To determine the seroprevalence of CMV HSV-1 and EBV in Chilean HIV-infected adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 400 HIV-infected adults aged 17 to 67 years (340 males) were studied during 2005 and 2006 CMV HSV-1 and EBV serum antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. RESULTS The mean lapse from the diagnosis of HIV and serum testing was 67 months and 69.5% patients received antiretroviral therapy. Sixty seven percent of the sample were men who had sex with men (MSM). The seroprevalence for CM, HSV-1 and EBV were 98.5, 92.2 and 99.7%, respectively. No patient had negative antibodies for all three viruses. Male patients that were negative for HSV-1 had a lower frequency of MSM than the rest of males (26% vs. 62%, p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS There is a high prevalence of positive antibodies against CMV HSV-1 and EBV in Chilean adults infected with HIV Specific diagnostic tests and antiviral therapy should be available for these patients.</dc:description>
