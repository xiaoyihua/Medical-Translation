<dc:description xml:lang="en">Subcutaneous granuloma annulare is a benign, chronic inflammatory lesion located usually at scalp or extremities and typical of childhood. Its etiology is unknown and no link with systemic diseases has been found. A thorough clinical history and normality at complementary tests are enough for its identification. It tends to dissaparition, so no therapy is needed although histologic study will let a definitive diagnosis. A case in a three years-old boy is reported. He was submitted because of four asymptomatic, long-lasting tough lesions at his scalp, without other antecedents. Radiologic and hematologic tests found no alteration. Two months later a larger size was appreciated in one of them, so it was removed and its histology was diagnostic for granuloma annulare. After a 10 months follow-up, no change in size has been detected in the remaining ones.</dc:description>
