<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report the first case described of genitourinary infection by Corynebacterium Thommsenii in a man. METHODS Descriptive study of a testicular infection by an atypical unknown germ in a patient, which was identified and diagnosed thank to the use of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We performed a bibliographic search of similar cases. RESULTS We only found one case of pleural infection by Corynebacterium Thommsenii in the human being, with no case of genitourinary involvement described. CONCLUSIONS To date there is only one case described of infection by Corynebacterium Thommsenii in human beings, possibly due to underdiagnosis for the slow grow of this pathogen. Genetic amplification methods by PCR should be demanded more frequently by clinicians because they provide an advance in the microbiologic diagnosis is slow-growing pathogens.</dc:description>
