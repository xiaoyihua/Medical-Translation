<dc:description xml:lang="en">Owing to the all-accelerating rhythm in present life changes, alienation is likely to be envisioned as the main feature of our time. To the traditional change factors handed down through centuries on, modern life patterns add fresh ones up, ss: 1) transformations at an accelerated pace, b) evolution of both scientific knowledge and technology, c) development of massive media, d) political challenges, e) crisis of both life and relationships models, f) crisis in ideologies and the scientific as well as the philosophical principles, and g) intense transculturation. These challenges are to be met by means of a permanent learning i.e. Man is to enterprise an educating process aiming at a body, character, and spirit forming up of every individual within the frame of his very culture. It is also suggested that the mourning process is essential to either success or failure in changes to be achieved.</dc:description>
