<dc:description xml:lang="en">Retrospective analysis of the results from corpse renal transplantation, under immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporin in a group of 58 elderly receptors (greater than or equal to 50 yr). The results are compared with those obtained in 152 receptors under 50 year of age transplanted during the same period of time (1984-1988). No statistical differences were seen between both groups regarding immunosuppressive therapy, number of transfusions, HLA histocompatibility, number of transplantations and percentage of hypersensitive patients. Incidence of rejection is significantly higher in the younger patients group, as well as graft loss due to immunological reasons. Mortality was significantly higher in the elderly group. Actuarial survival of the graft after two years is similar in both groups. It is concluded that in the era of cyclosporin, the receptor's age should still be considered a risk factor and, therefore, that maximum precautions should be taken in order to detect any additional risk factor within this group in a strategy to improve their survival.</dc:description>
