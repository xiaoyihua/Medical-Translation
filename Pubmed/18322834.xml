<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION This article analyzes the effects that the arrival of the nazis to power as well as the participation of the neuroscientists in the programs developed by nazi medicine had on german neurology. METHODS Review of the literature related with medicine in the times of the nazis, placing special attention on the role played by the neuroscientists. RESULTS The physicians were the professional group that joined the nazi party the most. Many neurologists, psychiatrists and neuropathologists participated in the sterilization, euthanasia and experimenting programs in humans. Based on the experience acquired in these projects, some were chosen as personnel in charge of extermination in the concentration camps. Eminent neurologists such as Hallervorden, Spatz and Schaltenbrand took advantage of the scientific possibilities offered by the euthanasia and experimentation projects in humans with no harm being done to their careers after the war. Many Jewish neurologist or dissidents were driven out of their work, required to go into exile or, in the worst of the cases, were jailed and assassinated. CONCLUSIONS The nazi government had two outstanding effects on german neurology. On the one hand, many neurologists were harmed due to racial or political reasons. On the other, outstanding neurologists participated in programs of nazi medicine. This reminds us of the perverse role that politics may play in medicine and that scientific knowledge should not forget ethics.</dc:description>
