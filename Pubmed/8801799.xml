<dc:description xml:lang="en">Exposition of the experience accrued over 8 years in endo-urological procedures performed to 303 patients divided in 2 groups: Lithiasic (Group I) and Non-lithiasic (Group II) patients. Ninety-two (92) percutaneous nephrostomies in 69 patients and 235 ureteroscopies in 234 patients were accomplished, removing 324 calculi and resolving other obstructive conditions. The rate of success was 85% and 98% for the percutaneous nephrostomies and ureteroscopies, respectively. Complications were reported in 7 patients after percutaneous nephrostomy and in 14 patients during ureteroscopy. Most of these complications resolved with the use of endoscopic techniques except in two patients who required open surgery. There were no deaths in the present series. The advantages of applying this technique over the conventional one are discussed.</dc:description>
