<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyse the indicators of use in the Gran Canaria Health Area. To characterise over-users so that the primary care team can take corrective measures. To design a computer tool giving appropriate useful information to the management, that can be directly put into practice in primary care. DESIGN Retrospective descriptive study. SATTING: Gran Canaria Health Area. Hierarchical descent in the analysis of data in the base health area and family care unit, in the year 2000. PARTICIPANTS Users of the Canaries Health Service registered on the individual health card data base. MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS The activity generated by 636 270 users with 2 876 394 appointments was studied. Mean frequency of attendance in the Gran Canaria Health Area was 4.52, with a 67.3% use rate. The user causing 11 or more visits per year was defined as an over-user. 13.4% of users were over-users and caused among them 52.3% of visits. 32.7% of users registered made no visit. CONCLUSIONS A small section of the population causes over half the consultations. The characteristics of these users need to be analysed so that programmes can be worked out to decrease their frequency of use. The integrated management software for primary care enables this information to be analysed and serves as a support for the primary care teams. Special attention needs to be paid to the population that does not use the health centres.</dc:description>
