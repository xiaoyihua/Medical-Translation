<dc:description xml:lang="es">In the order to develop some aspects of physical traumas, I have differentiated traumas caused by seeing and traumas caused by hearing. After discussing the question of whether we could make a psychological goal out of trauma, I have referred to Freud´s main ideas on the traumatic, and I have extracted two points: 1) the evolution between the theory of excess of excitation and the one that indicates that the traumatic events is not as important as its representation. Above all because it can be experienced as a foreign body, the source of internal excitation. 2) The idea of traumatic efficiency which makes unification of excitations necessary in order to enter latency. As a guideline I have described sessions with a child of six and a half who talks of the adventures of Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones, and I have put forward some thought about trauma relating clinical sessions, and I have expounded in detail traumatic listening in relation with parents traumatised by premature deaths of their own parents (AU)</dc:description>
