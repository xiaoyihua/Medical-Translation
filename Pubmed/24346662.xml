<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the effect of a pilot program of tele-assistance and tele-alarms on the elderly's self-perception of health status and to identify the satisfaction with and acceptance of the program. METHODS Cross-sectional study that included interviews with 378 elderly individuals, 294 caretakers/relatives and 53 health care professionals. The program was run in Mexico City in 2010. The variables were socio-demographic characteristics, self-rated health, satisfaction and acceptance of the program. The information was gathered through a standardized questionnaire. The statistical analysis included descriptive analysis and nonparametric tests. RESULTS Significant effects on self-perception of health were observed, 6.17 (SD 17.9 p &lt; 0.05) points above the average. The program was well received and accepted by the elderly, family caregivers and health professionals. CONCLUSIONS The program helps to maintain or improve quality of life, allows preventive care and is an ideal means of providing psychosocial support to the elderly.</dc:description>
