<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Non-communicating hydrocephalus is defined as a blockade of the physiological cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow from the choroid plexus to the subarachnoid space. Usually, a ventricle peritoneal shunt with a valve is employed as treatment but this does not provide a physiological restoration on the CSF flow. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study is to introduce a more physiological solution by means of endoscopic technique. We also pretend to find out some prognostical factors related to successful treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS We present a prospective non-randomized series of 32 endoscopic III ventriculostomies performed in patients with non-communicating hydrocephalus. When the blockade was due to a tumor, an endoscopic biopsy was performed at the same surgical time. In the same way, if the cause was a ventricular hematoma, an endoscopic aspiration was performed. The patients follow-up was two years. RESULTS The procedure was considered successful (83.8% of the cases) when the clinical symptoms resolved without ventricle-peritoneal shunt. We study the relationship of the blockade level and the highest value of intracranial pressure during endoscopy with the results of the procedure in terms of success and morbidity. We have found significant relation between high pressure during endoscopy and the practice of a complementary biopsy or hematoma evacuation. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic third ventriculostomy provides an effective and physiological solution to non communicating hydrocephalus. Complementary endoscopic procedures can be associated at the same surgical time, however this association can be related to increased values of intracranial pressure during surgical performance.</dc:description>
