<dc:description xml:lang="en">Clinical and laboratory findings in eight children seen in our department in the last seven years with Kawasaki's syndrome are described. Incidence in our area seems to be higher than it is in the whole country. Authors interested in transmitting their experience as general pediatricians, particularly on difficulties found to establish correct diagnosis in early stages of the disease. Therefore, they insist on the time at which signs, symptoms and laboratory data appeared. ECG was abnormal in five of our eight cases (62%). Bidimensional echocardiogram showed abnormalities in half of the patients in whom the procedure was performed. There were no deaths among our children. Bacteriological, serological and other laboratory investigations were not of help to diagnosis. They conclude that periungual descamation and thrombocytosis are the most useful data to confirm initial diagnostic suspicion.</dc:description>
