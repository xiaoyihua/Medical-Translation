<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To examine the reliability and validity of a scale to measure perceived barriers to active commuting to school among Spanish young people. METHOD The validity of the scale was assessed in a sample of 465 adolescents (14-18 years) using a confirmatory factor analysis and studying its association with self-reported active commuting to school. The reliability of the instrument was evaluated in a sub-sample that completed the scale twice separated by a one-week interval. RESULTS The results showed that the barriers scale had satisfactory fit indices, and two factors were determined. The first included environment- and safety-related items (α=0.72), while the other concerned planning and psychosocial items (α=0.64). Active commuting to school showed significant correlations with the total score of the barriers scale (rho=-0.27; p &lt;0.001), with the environmental/safety barriers (rho=-0.22; p &lt;0.001), as well as with the planning/psychosocial barriers (rho=-0.29; p &lt;0.001). Test-retest ICCs for the barriers ranged from 0.68 to 0.77. CONCLUSION The developed scale has acceptable validity and good reliability to assess barriers to active commuting to school among Spanish young people.</dc:description>
