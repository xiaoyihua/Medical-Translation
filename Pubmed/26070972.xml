<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Developmental hip dysplasia is a frequent cause of coxofemoral pain in young adults. Bernese periacetabular osteotomy emerges as a possible option for the management of pain relief and functional limitation, in order to delay the need for arthroplasty in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A descriptive-retrospective study was conducted on 26 selected patients with symptomatic developmental hip dysplasia treated with bernese periacetabular osteotomy between 1996 and 2009 (94% women). Mean age at time of surgery was 39.8 y (15-49 y), with a mean follow-up of 10 years. Osteoarthritis (OA Tönnis scale), acetabular index and Wiberg angle were evaluated by radiology and functionality was valued by using the de Merle-D'Aubigné-Postel scale. RESULTS The mean hospitalization time was 10 days. At 10 years, the mean radiography value of acetabular index was 9.03° and 38.3° for Wiberg angle (17° and 27° correction, respectively, above the mean pre-operative values). Joint lock was referred to by 43% of patients, and 53% to non-evidence based limb failure. Mean functional value was 14.30 (Good). At 5 years of follow-up, 20% advanced at least by one grade in OA Tönnis scale compared to their pre-operative status, increasing to 55% at 10 years. At 10 years after surgery, 83% patients did not need arthroplasty and 85% showed high satisfaction level. CONCLUSIONS Bernese periacetabular osteotomy is a useful alternative in young adults with symptomatic developmental hip dysplasia that can improve pain relief, femoral head coverage, and slow down coxofemoral osteoarthrosis progression in order to delay arthroplasty.</dc:description>
