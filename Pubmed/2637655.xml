<dc:description xml:lang="en">A series composed by 13 patients suffering Tuberculous Meningitis (TM) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is reported. The characteristics of the disease are compared with those obtained from a control group. TM reached a frequency of 18% in the first 66 patients with AIDS and neurologic disorders attended by the authors. The male/female ratio was 12:1. There was lesser frequency of headache in the group with TM and AIDS, but there was a greater frequency of lymph nodes, anemia, leukopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia and elevated ESR that in the control group. These differences were statistically significative. Parabolic and hyperbolic correlations were found between the number of cells and the albumin or glucose concentration in the CSF (and also between the later two parameters) of the patients with TM and AIDS. The treatment was very efficacious, but the proper duration and the long-term results of the therapy are unknown due to the difficult follow-up.</dc:description>
