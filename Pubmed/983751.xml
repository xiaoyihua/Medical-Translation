<dc:description xml:lang="en">"La Vuelta de Obligado" (Obligado bend of Paran√° river) is the name of a battle fought by local rebels against the colonial invading navy. The victory was due to a witty device: the patriots stretched a cable across the river and succeded in stopping the foreign float. The event is the paradigm of the everlasting fight of under-developped countries against powerful colonial metropolis. The author examines the conditions of local fight against colonizing cultural and scientific ideas, being his main content that scientific advancement needs not be an instrument of scientific imperialism. He analyzes in detail several factors currently impeding the use of scientific discoveries and improvements, focusing into concrete "obstacles" (in Bachelard's meaning) to betterment of Psychoanalytic knowledge. The obstacles are: 1. All-pervading transference. The rule adapted from Melanie Klein theories emphasizing hic et nunc validity of materials from the patient, neglects the fact that the analyst is also moved by desire, and that the patient's productions are not fragments of behavior able to be reduced to the present situation, but vectorial motions, always open and always re-opening into something defined since the beginning as forever lost. 2. Increasing activity for the analyst. The current hypothesis concerning the possibility of analyzing everything, encouraging the analyst's hyperactivity, does not allow for theoretical evaluation of the means and ways of manifestation of unconscious drives through gaps in the discourse. 3. Pan-counter-transference. The conception of counter-transference as an instrument is against Freud's contention, defining it as a reciprocal transference that must be fought in the same way as the patient's. 4. Belittling of theory. The thesis against theory, on the grounds that Psychoanalysis deals with affects and the affective life of patients, forgets that there is always some system for understanding the world and, for want of a theory, an ideological system is always ready to provide the grid underlying all concepts used. 5. Not-analyzing. The automatic "translation", lacking the search for new links to replace the ones that analysis dismantles, leads to denaturalizing the practice and keeping intact the patient's imaginary consistent universe. 6. Intergrationism. Other theories cannot be integrated to Psychoanalysis as they have different objects and different frameworks. Conversely, Psychoanalitic concepts cannot be formulated in other theories conceptual corpus for the same reason. The exception are the sciences having similar fields and methods of analysis, such as Semiotics or Linguistics. In their case the articulation of concepts becomes possible, but still requires the previous command of Psychoanalytic Theory in its full depth. 7. Communicationalism. The most common of all integrations with other sciences is the one linking Psychoanalysis with Communications Theory...</dc:description>
