<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND We undertook this study to determine risk factors for histological alterations of the female genital tract in an open population who attend a first-level care medical facility. METHODS We conducted a case/control cohort study that included patients from outpatient consultation who responded to a cervical cancer control and prevention program. We studied 1933 patients; 88 patients (cases) had cellular alterations and were matched with 88 patients without alterations (controls). Statistical analysis was carried out with one-way ANOVA for comparison between groups and association of variables with relative risk for 95% confidence interval; p &lt;0.05. RESULTS Mean age of the case group was 36.1 +/- 1.6 years and the control group had a mean age of 35.8 +/- 2.1 years. Diagnoses obtained in the case group showed a greater frequency of ectropion, human papilloma virus infection and CIN1. Risks factors analyzed in these patients showed statistical differences in number of gestations &gt;2 (RR = 2.33) and the early initiation of sexual activity (&lt;19 years) (RR = 1.14) for experiencing histological problems of the female genital tract. CONCLUSIONS Prevention of cervical cancer can be accomplished through timely and opportune detection in order to avoid the disease or to decrease risk factors by using condoms, delaying initiation of sexual activity and limiting the number of sexual partners. These are all strategies that the general population should be aware of.</dc:description>
