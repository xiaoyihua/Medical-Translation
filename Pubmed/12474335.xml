<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to report our experience with infliximab and analyse prognostic factors for response in Crohn's disease (CD). MATERIAL AND METHODS Consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled in the study when referred for infliximab infusion. Data collected included indication for infusion, patient epidemiological characteristics, Vienna classification, previous surgery, previous medications and extra-intestinal manifestations. Adverse events and clinical response were tabulated separately for patients with luminal or fistulous Crohn's disease. RESULTS 28 patients were treated (7 with inflammatory and 21 with fistulizing disease). Patients received a total of 116 infusions of infliximab: 57.1% (4 of 7) of patients with luminal disease had complete response within a median of 17.5 days (range 15-28 days), and 62% (13 of 21) of patients with fistulizing disease had complete response within a median of 9 days (range 6-51 days). All patients (5) without relapse received concomitant treatment with immune modifiers. The group of patients with previous resection or perianal fistula repair had complete response more frequently p = 0.03 (OR = 30; IC 95% = 1.47-119.8). CONCLUSIONS Infliximab is safe and beneficial in clinical practice for Crohn's disease. The re-treatment regimen of infliximab is effective in maintaining clinical response. Immunosuppressant therapy may have a role in the duration of maintained clinical remission in patients with fistulizing disease. In patients with perianal fistulizing disease infliximab treatment is more effective when previous resection or fistula repair is present.</dc:description>
