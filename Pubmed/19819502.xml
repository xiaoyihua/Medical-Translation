<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE To analyze the use of reperfusion therapy in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in Catalonia in a registry performed in 2006 (IAM CAT III) and its comparison with 2 previous registries PATIENTS AND METHODS Frequency of reperfusion therapy and time intervals between symptom onset - reperfusion therapy were the principal variables investigated. The IAM CAT I (June-December 2000) included 1,450 patients, the IAM CAT II (October 2002-April 2003) 1,386, and the IAM CAT III (October-December 2006) 367. RESULTS The proportion of patients treated with reperfusion increased progressively (72%, 79% and 81%) as the use of primary angioplasty (5%, 10% and 33%). In the III registry the transfer system most frequently used was the SEM/061 (17%, 32% and 47%, respectively) but the time interval symptom onset-first contact with the medical system did not improve (II, 90 vs III, 105 min), the interval symptom onset-thrombolytic therapy did hardly change (178, 165 and 177 min) and the interval hospital arrival-trombolysis (needle-door) tended to improve (59, 42 and 42 min). Thirty day mortality in STEMI patients declined progressively through the 3 registries (12.1, 10.6 and 7.4%, p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS The proportion of STEMI patients treated with reperfusion has improved but the interval to its application has not been shortened. To improve the latter it is mandatory an earlier contact with the medical system, a shortening of the intervals door-needle and door-balloon through better coordination between the 061, the sanitary personnel and the hospital administration, and to consider the subject as a real sanitary priority.</dc:description>
