<dc:description xml:lang="en">We prospectively studied 279 patients with epistaxis referred to ENT specialist from emergency room in our hospital in one year. Masculine sex (62%), medium or old ages (median 56 year), and associated diseases (HBP 22.9%, anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs 11.1%), were the most common. Predominant local etiologic factors were trauma (12.9%) and inflammation (14%). Epistaxis had been essential in 36.9%. The most frequent location in all ages was the anterior one, especially located in the Kiesselbach's area, although the incidence of the posterior epistaxis increases in characteristic way from fourth decade, affecting more to men. Most of epistaxis (&gt; 99%) were treated successfully by conservative approach and only two patients required surgical or interventional therapy. Patients between 30-59 year and the posterior epistaxis was the most refractory to the treatment. Hospitalized patients were older than ambulatory ones and had more associated diseases. Their average hospital stay was 9.2 days.</dc:description>
