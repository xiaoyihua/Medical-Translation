<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The aim of our work was to evaluate the dietary intake of patients with asthma. PATIENTS AND METHOD A total of 54 subjects with asthma were enrolled (average age 23.59 +/- 9.6 years). In all patients, we determined weight, height and the body mass index and a three days nutritional questionnaire was administered. RESULTS The total calories intake was normal. Distribution of calories was: 39.7% carbohydrates, 19.4% proteins and 40.9% lipids. Low intakes of vitamin A, D, E, thiamine and folic acid were detected, and an adequate intake of vitamin K, C, niacin and B12 was observed. The mineral intake showed an increase in calcium and a decrease in magnesium, zinc, iodine and selenium. The intake of polyunsaturated omega-9 fatty acids was 34.8(12.7) g/day, that of polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acids was 5.7(3.1) g/day, and the intake of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids was 0.85(0.31) g/day. Saturated fats represented a 18.4%. The omega6/omega3 ratio was 6.63. CONCLUSIONS Asthmatic patients have a low intake of vitamins A and E but an increase in the intake of saturated fatty acids.</dc:description>
