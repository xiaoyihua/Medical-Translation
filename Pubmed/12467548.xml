<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To evaluate the immediate results obtained with balloon aortic valvuloplasty in neonates and long-term echocardiographic outcome as well as to identify variables predictive for outcome. To identify the degree of agreement between hemodynamic and echocardiographic study. PATIENTS AND METHODS We analyzed the results obtained in 26 procedures performed in 18 boys and 8 girls (2.25:1), aged 2 to 49 days (16.1 12.9 days). All procedures were performed in the Pediatric Cardiology Unit of Ramón y Cajal Hospital in Madrid between June 1989 and June 2001. Follow-up was from 0 to 144 months (39.5 39.7 months). RESULTS The immediate effects observed through echocardiographic study were a significant decrease in the maximum Doppler gradient (from 77.8 to 32.4 mm Hg; p &lt; 0.0001) and in the medium Doppler gradient (from 41.7 to 18.5 mm Hg; p &lt; 0.05). Hemodynamic studies showed a significant decrease in left ventricular systolic pressure (from 119.8 to 82.8 mm Hg; p &lt; 0.0001) and an increase in aortic systolic pressure (from 56.8 to 66.6 mm Hg; p &lt; 0.007). The hemodynamic peak gradient decreased from 63.1 to 17.7 mm Hg; p &lt; 0.0001. In 23 % of the patients, aortic insufficiency significantly increased. Echocardiographic follow-up showed a significant increase in the telediastolic size of the left ventricle and a decrease in the maximum and medium Doppler gradient. The procedure showed initial success in 68.7 % and analysis of survival free of valvular surgery was 65.8 % at 45 months. Proportional risk analysis revealed that the post-valvuloplasty gradient was a predictive factor for future valvular surgery.</dc:description>
