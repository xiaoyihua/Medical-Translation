<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED INTRODUCTION AND OBJETIVES: Minimal invasive surgery trends to get prompt recovery in terms of inmediate deambulation and early discharge from hospital, without increasing patient's discomfort neither postoperative complications. This "fast-track" protocol is being progresively introduced in a crescent number of urological procedures. We are evaluating the viability of applying it in retroperitoneoscopic prone- position nephrectomy. METHODS AND MATERIALS We have performed a retrospective review of the clinical reports of the patients submitted to prone nephrectomy with hospitalization between 2007 and 2011 and we present patients submitted to this procedure in an outpatient basis (less than 8 hours hospital stay) from 2011. We have recorded epidemiological factors, diagnosis, surgical time, first postoperative week analgesic requirements, parents cofort and postoperative complications. RESULTS All the procedures were performed retroperitoneoscopically in prone position using two trocars. We included 34 nephrectomies with a mean surgical time of 107 minutes. Mean postoperative stay was under 24 hours in 23 patients, two of them were discharged in the first 8 hours after the procedure. Hospital stay over this time was due to concomitant pre-existent pathology in 6 patients and to non urological fever in the remaining 3. Analgesia was excellent in every patient with endovenous non-steroid drugs, registering no pain after administering them orally. There were no complications. CONCLUSIONS We believe that "fast-track" requirements can be applied to prone-retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy in pediatric population, as long as they have no associated pathology. In our experience this surgical procedure can be included in day-case surgery, increasing patient's confort and with a positive economical impact.</dc:description>
