<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS To collect some factors that can help the clinician to design a plan of pharmacologic treatment for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). DEVELOPMENT We did a literature search of current available studies on the pharmacological treatment of ADHD. Treatment of ADHD requires the design of a comprehensive and individualized plan for each patient, family and environment, which includes three main parts: psychoeducation and behavioral management training, academic support, and medication. Stimulants (methylphenidate) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine) are the two drugs approved in Spain for children and adolescents and then treatment in adults with ADHD. The effect size of stimulants (1.0) is higher than for atomoxetine (0.7-0.8). The methodology of the study, especially the duration, may affect the effect size. The range of NNT is 1.9 to 5.3, higher than other drugs for other disorders (antidepressants or antipsychotics). Some factors that impact the choice of medication for ADHD are: comorbidity, potential adverse effects (especially low appetite, insomnia, tics and potential abuse of medication), parental preference and patient need for action along the day or at specific times of day, need rapid onset of action, and any visa price of medication. CONCLUSIONS There are some factors related to the patient and the features of ADHD, drug, and the patient's situation or environment which should be considered when selecting a treatment for ADHD.</dc:description>
