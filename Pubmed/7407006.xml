<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two groups with the two procedures were made. In the first group, ligation was made within the first 10 seconds following birth, in the second group, at the third minute of life. The acid--base balance, pO2 hemoglobin and hematocrit were studied at birth, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes later and at 3, 30 and 60 days of life; neonatal heart rate at 10, 50 and 80 minutes and bilrubin at the third day after birth; weight at birth, 24, and 48 hours and 30 and 60 days after birth. The statistical analysis showed significant differences between both groups attributable to placental transfusion in relation to volemia and potential reserves of iron. On the other hand, no harmful effects followed the practice of late ligation of the umbilical cord; thus it may be recommended as routine procedure in normal newborns.</dc:description>
