<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is relatively uncommon in eyelid (1 to 2% of all eyelid lesions). The true frequency of this tumor has been difficult to estimate because of a tendency for overdiagnosis (basal cell carcinoma and sebaceous carcinoma) in published reports of eyelids lesions. METHODS We present a retrospective review of a series of 18 patients, surgically treated in our hospital between 1990 and 1998, analysing their characteristics. RESULTS The pathologic examination revealed 18 SCC. Tumors developed most frequently in males, lower eyelid and right eye. The mean age and highest incidence decade were 71 years old and 71-80 years old (45%). CONCLUSIONS SCC is the second common malignant eyelid tumor. Male are most affected. Recurrence after surgical excision is uncommon, but three of our patients developed orbital invasion (16.6%). SCC are much more likely to metastasise than basal cell carcinomas. They arise from pre-existing actinic keratoses, however, they possess less metastasic risk than other presentations. Unfortunately, our culture values the well-tanned look. At-risk patients may pay the ultimate price for this vanity.</dc:description>
