<dc:description xml:lang="en">Twenty six patients coming from endemic areas, with diagnosis of filariasis caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa and Manzonella (Dipetalonema perstans) and 29 patients suspicious of suffering filariasis were studied by means of Knott, membrane filter and indirect immunofluorescence techniques. Results of microfilaremia were compared with antibody titers and it was verified that there was not relationship between these parameters. The suspicious patients presented higher antibody levels than those of the verified patients. In additions, a preliminary study was carried out on the serologic behaviour of some patients treated with diethylcarbamazine (6 mg/kg daily, during 14 days) and increase of antibody titers was observed in most of the cases after three days and a decrease after the first month of treatment.</dc:description>
