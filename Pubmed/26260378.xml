<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse patient satisfaction with care provided in the pre-anaesthetic consultation and its determining factors. MATERIAL AND METHOD An anonymous questionnaire was randomly distributed to patients attending a pre-anaesthesia clinic, which included 4 questions with 5 possible answers on a (very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, fairly satisfied, satisfied and very satisfied) categorical graduated scale related to punctuality, understanding of the information received, respectful treatment, and overall satisfaction. The fifth question was about the knowledge or the name of the anaesthesiologist who attended them. A binary logistic regression model was used, which identified the predictors of satisfaction, calculated the odds ratios, and their respective 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS A total of 4006 questionnaires were analysed, in which 99.2% (3966) of users rated as satisfied/very satisfied the question about the respectful treatment, 98.4% (3937) of the information received and understanding, 77.4% (3096) punctuality in attending, and 97, 6% (3909) overall satisfaction. Almost three-quarters (71%, 2844) did not know the name of the anaesthesiologist. Regression analysis associated the more satisfied with their treatment (OR 17.44; P&lt;.0005) and the information received (OR 14.94, P&lt;.0005), while punctuality (OR 5 40; P&lt;.0005) was the factor that contributed less to the result. CONCLUSION In our population satisfaction in pre-anaesthesia consultation is due mainly to the communication skills of the anaesthesiologist.</dc:description>
