<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective To describe knowledge, attitudes and practices about remaining drugs (RD) and expired drugs (ED) disposal. Method Descriptive study in 392 patients at a hospital in Bogotá, Colombia. Results Participants were 17 to 86 years old. 66.1% of them had RD, 31.4 % were nervous system drugs (according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification of WHO). 25.8 % of people dispose of RD in common waste (CW) and 64.0 % dispose of ED in CW. 17.4 % think RD, and 62.5 % think ED should be thrown away like CW. 4.9% of people think RD, and 6.6 % think ED should be thrown away in specialized places. 92.4 % people don't know about DRP nor 86.7 % about "Puntos Azules"; 94.6 % would like more information. 79.1 % think that throwing away drugs can affect health and, 88.8 %, the environment. Conclusions Most participants dispose of drugs inappropriately. They think that it is wrong and this can damage the environment and health. There is an interest in being informed. This reveals an area of possible work in awareness, information and education from pharmacovigilance about this subject for the benefit of the population.</dc:description>
