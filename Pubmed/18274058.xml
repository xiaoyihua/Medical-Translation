<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Dyspepsia is a word that means bad digestion. In the conviction of which it is a question of an entity that it includes different disciplines, we realize a meeting consensus to discuss and to resolve a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm of national order. OBJECTIVE To agree on a national algorithm applicable to the functional dyspepsia. MATERIAL AND METHODS In June 2005 a multidisciplinary group met to design and to propose a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for the functional dyspepsia. RESULTS Priority gives to the medical-patient relationship and to the reinsurance. Then we divide the patients if they have signs of alarm. If they are present we studied them, if not we divide them, in accordance to the principal symptoms, in pain or epigastric discomfort. If they have pain we realized an endoscopy and a abdominal ultrasound scan. If they are positive, treatment of the disease. If the studies are negative or it has epigastric discomfort we propose a therapeutic test. Pain: H2 bloquers, wait 4 to 6 weeks, if it not response we propose a PPI, wait for 4 to 6 weeks, if there is no response psychiatric or psychological consultation. Discomfort: proquinetics, wait for 4 to 6 weeks if there are no answers, antidepressants in low doses, wait for 4 to 6 weeks if there are no answers, ca. bloquers, sumatriptan or trimebutina. In all cases we can add tranquillizers in anxious personality. CONCLUSIONS A multidisciplinary dignostic and therapeutic consensus of national order for the patients with functional dyspepsia was obtained.</dc:description>
