<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective. The aim of the study was to analyze tuberculosis treatment outcomes in a health area of the National Health System. Material and Methods. Analytical cohort study of tuberculosis' cases treated in the hospital care of the health area of Salamanca (Spain) 6 months. The clinical record constituted the basic source of data, whose information was complemented by a clinical interview to the patient. The microbiological records were additionally used for classifying the therapeutic outcomes in satisfactory outcome (SO), potentially unsatisfactory outcome (PUO) and death. A total of 146 patients met the inclusion criteria; 108 patients were interviewed. Their average age was 49 years. Out of them, 29.6% (32/108) showed some social risk factor (SRF). Results. The SO level was 55.6% (IC 95%: 55.6±9); the variables associated with the SO were young elderly patients, living in family and patterns of 6 months. The PUO proportion stood at 40.7% (IC 95%: 40.7±9); the variables which increased the PUO probability were adulthood, residing in other provinces, living alone, comorbidity, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), alcoholism and social maladjustment. The variables included in the final model for PUO in logistic regression were adult, comorbidity and SFR, while the institutional conditions associated the mortality. Conclusions. The SO rates can be improved. The PUO level is conditioned by high loss rates, 31.5% (95% CI: 31.5 ± 9), so measures should be established for reduction and improve the effectiveness of the overall treatment.</dc:description>
