<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To retrospectively study the diagnosis and treatment of benign breast disease during pregnancy and breastfeeding at our department. To review the relevant literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2001 to March 2005, a total of 91 pregnant or breastfeeding women (age range: 23-36 years) were diagnosed with benign breast pathology. All patients presented with palpable nodules or inflammatory symptoms. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle cytology was performed in all cases and percutaneous core biopsy was considered necessary in three cases. Abscesses were drained when present. Patients provided their informed consent before all procedures. RESULTS Tumors were detected in 28 cases (30%): fibroadenomas (n = 12), lactating adenomas (n = 9), galactoceles (n = 5), and papillomas (n = 2). Conservative treatment with ultrasound follow-up was employed in all cases except one, which required surgical treatment in the third trimester. On 63 occasions (70%), the pathology was inflammatory, including abscesses in 24 cases (38%); abscesses were drained using fine-needle aspiration (n = 16) or pig-tail catheter (n = 3), according to protocol, depending on the size of the abscess (less than or greater than 3 cm). In 5 cases the abscesses were drained surgically. CONCLUSIONS The most common benign breast pathology during pregnancy is inflammatory and is satisfactorily managed with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage with good esthetic results. Ultrasound is the diagnostic technique of choice, together with cytology; percutaneous biopsy is only performed in uncertain cases to minimize the risk of fistulas. Management of tumors after histological confirmation should be conservative with close follow-up. These tumors cause no problems for the child, the mother, or breastfeeding.</dc:description>
