MATERIALS AND METHODS Information collected by the Direccion General de Epidemiologia by the surveillance strategy in non-communicable diseases for the period 2006-2014 was requested. The rate of age-adjusted incidence and a descriptive statistical analysis of the variables studied were calculated. RESULTS 1261 CRC cases were reported in patients between 20-49 years of age. The annual percentage change (APC) for the incidence is declining -0.09% (p=0.004). The CPA for CRC cases was -3.9% in men (p=0.009) and -5.22% in women (p=0.014). 640 women and 621 men were reported. Most cases of CRC in the studied population is the group of 40-49 years with 60.3% of cases. Lima was the region with the highest number of reported cases (42.6%). 63.7% of CRC cases were represented by colon tumors. CONCLUSIONS Based on case reports provided by the DGE, there is a trend of decrease in the incidence of CRC cases in young adults Peruvian in the last 10 years.</dc:description>
