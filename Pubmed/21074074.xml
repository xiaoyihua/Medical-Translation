<dc:description xml:lang="en">The recent introduction of new drugs in the therapeutic arsenal for the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes has opened up new perspectives and raised hope for improved metabolic control in these patients. DPP-4 inhibitors are a family of drugs whose action is mediated by the incretin hormones, in particular GLP-1. This hormone is involved in the control of glucose homeostasis, as it stimulates insulin secretion in response to food intake and halts glucagon production. This effect, which is altered in patients with type 2 diabetes, can be improved by administering this group of drugs. The available evidence suggests that the efficacy, tolerability, safety, low drop-out rate and limited effects on weight, together with the low risk of hypoglycemic episodes, could place this group of drugs high on the treatment list in patients with type 2 diabetes. Incretin therapy provides an alternative to currently available glucose-lowering drugs for type 2 diabetes with good efficacy and a favorable profile on weight. In the studies performed to date, DPP-4 inhibitors seem safe. However, these agents must continue to be evaluated in long-term studies performed in clinical practice to ensure their effectiveness and safety profile, as well as to determine their precise role among all the currently available options in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</dc:description>
