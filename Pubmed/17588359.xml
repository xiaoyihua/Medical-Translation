<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has been commercialized in Spain since June 2001. We aim to evaluate the impact of this vaccine in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Navarre. POPULATION AND METHOD The laboratories of microbiology of Navarre declare all the isolations of Streptococcus pneumoniae in samples of normally sterile corporal fluids. We analyzed the incidence of IPD in children younger than 5 years between weeks 41 of 2000 and 40 of 2005. RESULTS The doses of PCV7 sold up to 2005 would provide a cover of 27% in children younger than 5 years, having assumed 4 dose schedules. In the 5 seasons, 103 cases of IPD were diagnosed. From the 2 first seasons (2000-2002) to the last one (2004-2005) a reduction of 69% in the incidence rate of IPD caused by vaccine serotypes was observed (from 33 to 10 cases by 100,000 children under 5 years; p = 0.003). Between those same periods the incidence of IPD caused by non-vaccine serotypes increased a 36% (from 42 to 57 by 100,000; p = 0.405). The global incidence of IPD diminished a 12% (from 77 to 67 by 100,000; p = 0.689). The percentage of cases that had received PCV7 increased until 45% in season 2004-2005 (p &lt; 0.001). The meningitis and bacteraemic pneumonias supposed 42% of the IPD, without significant changes during the period (p = 0.442). CONCLUSIONS Since the PCV7 was marketed the pattern of serotypes has changed, but the expected reduction in the total IPD incidence has not been achieved.</dc:description>
