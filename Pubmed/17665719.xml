<dc:description xml:lang="en">The healthy park initiative is an example of a prevention and health promotion programme in a community affected by high levels of drug use. It was developed through a strategic partnership with local actors (such as community leaders and youth groups), public institutions (Health and Education Ministries and the local police) and private sector institutions (NGOs, local commerce). The community involvement was essential throughout the project's entire process of design and implementation. Community members were empowered through direct responsibility for carrying out the project and its follow-up, through advocacy initiatives and financial accounting with the funding agency, the Belge Technical Cooperation group. The key programme outputs include the creation of a framework for community coexistence and a community development plan, which allowed not only to plan and distribute responsibilities among the neighbours for the park's care and maintenance, but also to coordinate an increase in services and development opportunities with the local authorities.</dc:description>
