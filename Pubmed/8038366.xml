<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To establish what the most common complications are in the pregnancies of adolescent women in our environment. DESIGN Retrospective study. SETTING Pregnant women who had their children in the Ciudad de Jaén Maternity Centre. PATIENTS Pregnant women who gave birth in our centre in 1991 and 1992. The study group was composed of 104 adolescents (under 19 years old) and the control group by 7,824 non-adolescent pregnant women during this same period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The most common general complication is the threat of premature delivery, which was more common in pregnant women under 19 than in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). There was no higher incidence among the adolescents of any other medical or obstetric pathology, including the frequency of Caesarean deliveries and neonatal morbidity/mortality. CONCLUSIONS In our environment, the most common complication in adolescent pregnancies is the threat of premature birth. For other pathologies there are no differences from other women.</dc:description>
