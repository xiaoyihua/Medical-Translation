<dc:description xml:lang="en">Considering the present coexistence in our unit of different criteria that guide the rules and visits timetable of the relatives, the objective of this study is to know the opinion of all the implied people in the clinic relation (sanitary staff, patients and relatives), about the rules of the visit in our Coronary Unit to compare, discuss and bring the protocol unit up to date. This is an observational and transversal study in which 40 sanitary staff, 56 patients and 53 relatives have been surveyed. The study was developed in 2002, and a survey made by us was used to collect the next parameters: number and length of the visits, profits and troubles when the visit timetable is more flexible; opinion about the waiting room; and the convenience or not of using the mobile phone for the patient. For doing the statistical analysis it has been calculated the distribution of the frequencies of the results, and the Chi2 test. In general, the sanitary staff is who has a more positive attitude for visiting, being nurses particularly the most flexible, considering the patients'condition. Relatives and patients have the same opinion more or less but they aren't so flexible.</dc:description>
