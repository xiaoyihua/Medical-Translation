<dc:description xml:lang="en">Patient-centered healthcare is currently one of the most pursued goals in health services. It is necessary to ensure a sufficient level of cooperative and coordinated work between different providers and settings, including family and social and community resources. Clinical integration occurs when the care provided by health professionals and providers is integrated into a single coherent process through different professions using shared guidelines and protocols. Such coordination can be developed at three levels: macro, which involves the integration of one or more of the three basic elements that support health care (the health plan, primary care and specialty care), with the aim of reducing fragmentation of care; meso, where health and social services are coordinated to provide comprehensive care to elderly and chronic patients; and micro, aimed to improve coordination in individual patients and caregivers. The implementation of new roles, such as Advanced Practice Nursing, along with improvements in family physicians' problem-solving capacity in certain processes, or modifying the place of provision of certain services are key to ensure services adapted to the requirements of chronic patients.</dc:description>
