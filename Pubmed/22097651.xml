<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Pectus carinatum (PC) is a deformity that involves the protrusion of the anterior chest wall. It is 10 times less frequent than pectus excavatum. It has a progressive growth and is more common with men. There are two different types, the lower or condrocorporal which is the most common one, and the upper or condromanubrial. Most of the time there are no cardio-respiratory symptoms. OBJECTIVE We present our experience in the orthopedic treatment of the pectus carinatum. METHOD Retrospective review of patients treated in our hospital from 2002 until 2009. Patients were treated with observation, aerobic exercises, postural change and/or compression braces. Literature review was performed of the treatment for this pathology. RESULTS 18 patients have been diagnosed with PC, 16 were men and 2 women. All were treated in a nonoperative way. Only 11 of them used a compression brace. We missed two follow-ups and another has just yet begun to achieve proper results. All the rest have had excellent results with nonoperative treatment. None of them have had a surgical treatment. CONCLUSION The PC is a disease that most often is a cosmetic problem, with no impact on a cardio-respiratory level. Classically it has been a surgical entity. In our experience we have found that the orthopedic method is an effective alternative, safe and with a significant reduction in morbidity. But we need the collaboration of the patient to accept and maintain continuity in the use of the prostheses.</dc:description>
