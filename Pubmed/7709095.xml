<dc:description xml:lang="en">With the aim to evaluate the efficacy of four vermicides, praziquantel, mebendazole, nitroscanate and triclorfon in the control of Bothriocephalus acheilognathi in carps, one hundred and sixty, two year-old carps (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) with an average weight of 120 g and a mean parasitic burden of 115.5 parasites/fish were used. Five groups of 30 fish each were randomly formed. Each group was then subdivided in three groups, each of 10 individuals/pond. The three subgroups of group A received 30, 50 and 70 mg/Kg of praziquantel, respectively. Groups B and C received 2.2, 4.4, and 6.8 mg/Kg of mebendazole suspension and mebendazole solution respectively; groups D and E received 10, 30, 50 mg/Kg; and 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 mg/Kg of nitroscanate and trichlorfon respectively. Group F of 10 fish remained as non-treated control. Praziquantel showed 100% of efficacy for all doses, therefore it was excluded from the statistical analysis. The subgroups B, C, D and E compared with the non-treated control were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01); showing in all treatments an additive effect, the higher the dose the better efficacy, except trichlorfon which showed a different tendency, having no explanation on that matter.</dc:description>
