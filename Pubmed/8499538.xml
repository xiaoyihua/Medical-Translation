<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To discover the paediatric demand at a child health clinic (CHC) and its hourly spread. Based on this, to see if the attendance of paediatricians is justified during the hours covered by the CHC. To evaluate, too, whether consumers properly use the CHC. DESIGN Descriptive, crossover, non-random study. SETTING Primary Care. PARTICIPANTS All children under 14 attended at Soria's urban Primary Care centre between 31 January and 31 March, 1991, by the paediatricians and general practitioners. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Paediatricians attended 49.8% of the consultations, which covered 17.7% of the weekly opening-time. Nine per cent of children were breast-fed. The most common reasons for attending were: temperature (48%) and cough (20%). The most common diagnoses were tonsillitis (29.4%), Acute Respiratory Infection (16%) and otitis (12.3%). Emergency treatment was given in 4.5% of cases. Prescriptions were given for 94.7% of cases and 1.6% were referred to hospital. CONCLUSIONS Paediatric demand is to a high degree occasioned by infectious, respiratory and ENT conditions. The proportion of referrals to hospital and the application of treatment in the Primary Care centre indicate insufficient use by the consumer. On the basis of the present study, we are unable to determine whether the presence of paediatricians is justified or not.</dc:description>
