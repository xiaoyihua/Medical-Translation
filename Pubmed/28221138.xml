<dc:description xml:lang="en">Renal lithiasis is one of the most common disorders in modern society, constituting an important health problem that associates a great economic burden. The nature of stone disease varies according to age and sex, being also influenced by dietary and lifestyle factors, and climatic variations among others. In spite of the advances made in the management of this pathology, it continues being a disease with a high recurrence rate. In recent years, several studies have pointed out that its prevalence is rising especially in developed countries. This increase seems to be fundamentally due to changes in dietary habits and lifestyle, although other factors such as migratory flows from rural areas to major cities, and a rise in global temperatures may also be involved. In the present article, we discuss the main factors that seem to influence today the epidemiology of urinary litiasis, as well as the aforementioned increase of prevalence.</dc:description>
