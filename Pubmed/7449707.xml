<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since the beginning of this century, countless efforts have been made to give adequate training to those who will be responsible for administering the health services. Yet, despite numerous recommendations and initiatives promoted by PAHO, private foundations, and the governments themselves, the situation with respect to medical care administration remains critical. In view of the status of health administration in the Region, the authors propose that different academic institutions join with the health services in the organization of courses based on a multidisciplinary approach (as shown in the annex), which would enable the students to acquire knowledge and skills in different areas so that they can take over the management of the complex health services and programs required in the world of today.</dc:description>
