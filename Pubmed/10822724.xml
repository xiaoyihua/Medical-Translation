<dc:description xml:lang="en">The in vivo contribution of diffusion, convection ad adsorption to beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) elimination by hemodiafiltration (HDF) was investigated. 11 patients (8M/3W), with a mean age of 59 +/- 10 years and weighing 62.7 +/- 8.7 kg were studied. A 1.89 m2 polysulphone membrane was used in 180 min postdilution HDF. Samples at blood inlet (bi), blood autlet (bo), dialysate outlet (do) and ultrafiltrate (uf) were taken to determine beta 2-m concentrations at 30 and 150 min. Rates of flow (Q, ml(min) prescribed were: infusion, Qinf = 103.6 +/- 12.3, Quf = 14.6 +/- 4.0 y Qb = 465 +/- 5.0. Effective Qbi was automatically measured by the machine and Qdo = 800 + Quf. The removed beta 2-m mass (M, mg/min) was obtained by multiplying rates of flow (Q, L/min) by beta 2-m concentrations (mg/L) at each sampling point. From mass balance, we calculated the mass of beta 2-m removed (mg/min) by adsorption 0.23 +/- 0.2, by convection 0.7 +/- 0.3 and by diffusion 1.0 +/- 0.4, at 30 min. At 150 min, the beta 2-m mass removed was -0.06 +/- 0.1 by adsorption 0.4 +/- 0.1 by convection and 0.3 +/- 0.1 by diffusion. In HDF, these beta 2-m eliminating mechanisms play a variable role throughout the session. The more significant conclusion is that diffusion of beta 2-m with a synthetic "open" membrane is an important method of removing beta 2-m, comparable to convection over the whole procedure. That result explain the relative efficacy of beta 2-m clearance by HDF convection, and also explain why isolated diffusion is an efficient mechanism for beta 2-m removal by high-flux hemodialysis.</dc:description>
