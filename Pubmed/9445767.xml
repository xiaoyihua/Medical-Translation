<dc:description xml:lang="en">The leaders of 21 Ibero-American countries came to Vi침a del Mar (Chile) for the sixth meeting of the now-traditional Ibero-American Summits. The Declaration that resulted from the Summit reiterated the commitment of these nations to the principles of democracy, the rule of law, and political pluralism. The development of efficient and participatory systems of democratic government was one of the most important of the topics dealt with at the meeting and served as the framework for the discussion and the search for solutions to common problems, such as poverty, arms trafficking, unequal opportunity for men and women, and inappropriate government practices. The leaders also supported a series of initiatives and international programs in the technological and cultural arenas that will strengthen the ties and unite the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries.</dc:description>
