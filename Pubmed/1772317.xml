<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report our experience with five children with pulmonary embolism and infarction. Two with congenital heart disease, one with rheumatic cardiopathy and two with a previously healthy cardiopulmonary system. The risk factors, clinical behavior and ECG were similar to those in adults. In chest roentgenogram we found pulmonary infarction with cavitations in three patients because of a delayed diagnosis. All patients had hypoxemia and hypocapnia, and diagnosis was made on the basis of segmentary or larger defects in perfusion gammagraphy. In just one case we obtained V/Q gammagraphy and pulmonary angiography. In one case we confirmed the clinical diagnosis by autopsy. We conclude that it is very important to keep this diagnosis in mind in all children with respiratory failure.</dc:description>
