<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to know the opinion and general knowledge of patients about the informed consent (IC), and their participation in the decision-making (DM) process. MATERIAL AND METHODS A descriptive, transversal, observational, qualitative and quantitative study was designed with 120 patients randomly surveyed at the 8 University Hospital Complexes of Galicia, Spain. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The mean age was 52.14 years, with 50% of men. 84.21% of the ICs provided by non-medical personnel were limited to delivering and reading it. 90% of patients after signing the IC, trust their doctor. Only 50% of the professionals tried to involve the patient in DM. 53.33% of the patients participated in DM. 45.83% patients signed for having understood and accepted the explanation, being completely satisfied 95 of the patients surveyed (79.17%). CONCLUSIONS It is essential to change the attitude of non-medical health professionals involved in the DM process, because their involvement is not being promoted. Although less than half of the respondents have signed the IC for having understood, the degree of satisfaction and confidence in the doctor was not compromised.</dc:description>
