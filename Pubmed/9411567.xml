<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The ascertainment of patients who consume important amounts of alcohol admitted to a hospital is essential to prevent medical and psychological complications. Carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) is a new marker of alcohol consumption which requires validation in the hospital setting. METHODS The values of carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT), gamma glutamil transpeptidase (GGT) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were measured in 101 consecutive patients admitted to the Internal Medicine and Surgery Departments. Considering amounts higher than 60 g/day of ethanol for male patients and higher than 40 g/day for female patients as risk consumption, the values for sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve were calculated for the different biological tests. RESULTS Twenty-six percent of patients reported a consumption of risk. The sensitivity of the tests were lower than 50% and specificities higher than 77%. CDT had the lowest sensitivity (15%) but it was very specific (98%). CDT had a better sensitivity among women than among men. None of the tests had an area under the curve with adequate efficiency levels. CONCLUSIONS CDT among the hospitalized patients and other biological markers of alcohol consumption have a low efficiency.</dc:description>
