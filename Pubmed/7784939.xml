<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE Some genetic factors associated to the HLA system phenotypes may allegedly predispose to the development of infection in patients exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). So the aim of this study was to assess if certain HLA antigens are positive or negative risk factors in the development of AIDS in Zulia State. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 62 samples were studied, 31 from HIV seropositive subjects and 31 form healthy individuals. The patients were subclassified into four groups in accordance with Atlanta's CDC guidelines. Tests for histocompatibility including HLA-A-B-C, DR and DQ typing were performed with Terasaki's technique. VIH positivity was determined by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot. The statistical evalub1p4n was performed with the chi 2 test for antigen frequency comparison, the relative risk (RR) was estimated with the Ryder and Svelgaard test, and the inferential analysis was made by means of non-parametric statistics. RESULTS Most patients were included in CDC's groups II and IV, 48.4% and 29.0%, respectively. Increased B35 and DQw2 and decreased B39 and DR2 antigens were found when comparing the HLA distribution in the sample and the antigenic frequency of the population. RR &gt; 1 was observed in the infected patients A for A1, A3, A10, A11, B5, B7, B12, B14, B35, B61, CW4, DR4, DRW52 and DQW2 HLA antigens. A positive association between symptomatic infected patients and antigen B35 was present (X = 7.045). CONCLUSION The findings reported here suggest that antigen B35 is a major risk factor for the development of AIDS.</dc:description>
