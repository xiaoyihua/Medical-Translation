<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile has a two decades experience in training endocrinology specialists. This communication explains the operation of the training program and the results of a survey, answered by 90% of Endocrinologists that were trained at the center. This survey covers different aspects of the program such as the strengths and weaknesses of the academic teaching and the present position of the trainees. Questions about the working environment and the relationship with their teachers during the application of the program are also included. These results can be useful for other University centers that are planning a training program in endocrinology and for those physicians that are planning to become endocrinologists.</dc:description>
