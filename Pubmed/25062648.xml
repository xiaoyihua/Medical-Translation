<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common malignancy in patients who have received a solid organ transplant. Multiple factors are involved in the onset of posttransplant NMSC. OBJECTIVES To analyze the relationship between new immunosuppressive drugs and the onset of NMSC in renal transplant recipients. METHOD This was a combined retrospective and prospective observational study in which we studied 289 patients who received a kidney transplant between January 1996 and December 2010 at Hospital Universitario Doctor Peset in Valencia, Spain. RESULTS Seventy-three patients (25.2%) developed 162 NMSCs over a median follow-up of 72 months. There were no statistically significant differences in the onset of NMSC on comparing different induction therapy strategies involving monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. NMSCs occurred less frequently in patients treated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors than in those treated with other immunosuppressive regimens, although the differences were not statistically significant. Three of 5 patients with recurrent NMSC who were switched from calcineurin inhibitors to mTOR inhibitors developed additional NMSCs despite the change. CONCLUSIONS Induction therapy with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in renal transplant recipients is not associated with an increased risk of NMSC. While mTOR inhibitors are associated with a lower risk of posttransplant NMSC, it remains to be determined whether a switch to these drugs is useful in the management of patients who develop multiple NMSCs.</dc:description>
