<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The occupational environment generates a large amount of illness which involves several specialities, including neurology. However, there is little awareness--or little training--in this field as in most medical specialities, since in the basic tool of a doctor's work, the clinical history, importance is sometimes given to aspects such as sex, race etc. and data referring to the patient's occupation and the risks this may imply for his health are considered to matter less. DEVELOPMENT The creation of a new working party within the Sociedad Española de Neurología, that of Neurología del Trabajo (Occupational Neurology) aims to correct these deficiencies, and to make colleagues aware of the importance of assessing the occupational hazards of patients and attempt to relate them to the clinical picture which presents. In order to do this we must first mark out our field of action, the commonest diseases and the administrative route used for claiming for these conditions. Then we will have to evaluate our relationship with other professional colleagues in the field of occupational health and finally consider the tasks of training, investigation and promotion of occupational health.</dc:description>
