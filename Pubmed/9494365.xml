<dc:description xml:lang="en">A two-year-old boy with a history of slow growth, snoring during sleep and adenoid hypertrophy underwent adenoidectomy and transtympanic drainage under general anesthesia. Immediately after extubation, severe inspiratory stridor and shallow labored breathing began and persisted over a period of two hours, in spite of corticoid administration and oxygen therapy. The signs receded partially when the patient was seated and with a mandibular traction maneuver. As symptoms persisted, foreign body obstruction was ruled out by examination of the cavum and upper airway under general anesthesia and with orotracheal intubation. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit, where he remained intubated for 18 hours. After extubation, stridor and shallow labored breathing reappeared but gradually receded as the residual effects of sedation disappeared. The parents mentioned symptoms suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) occurring since the boy was 6 months old and that had worsened in recent months. OSAS in children is characterized by intermittent obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, causing snoring and periods of apnea/hypopnea that lead to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. The most frequent cause is hypertrophy of the adenoid and tonsils, and the treatment of choice is adenotonsillectomy, although the risk of postoperative respiratory distress in such children is high. It is important to rule out OSAS in children who are candidates for adenotonsillectomy so that such patients are not scheduled for ambulatory surgery, but rather given adequate postoperative monitoring and treatment.</dc:description>
