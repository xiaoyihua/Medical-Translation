<dc:description xml:lang="en">The relation between cigarette smoking and obstetrical history, characteristics of skin and voice, presence of hirsutism and newborn weight/height index was studied in 100 hospitalized women. 45 had never smoked, 36 were present and 19 former smokers. No differences were found in the average age of menarche, number of live births or stillborns. Abortions were twice as frequent in women smoking more than 10 cigarettes a day. Menopause occurred an average of 5 years earlier among smokers. A significant increase in hoarseness and face hirsutism was detected, the relative risk for heavy smokers (more than 10 cigarettes per day) being 14.2 for hoarseness, 5.6 for facial hirsutism and 2.8 for other locations of hirsutism. Obesity was twice as common among smokers. These findings, related to hormonal disturbance, should be used in education efforts in the anti-smoking campaign among Chilean women.</dc:description>
