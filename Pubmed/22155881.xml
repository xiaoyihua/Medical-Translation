<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To present the case of a woman with the diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and Stauffer's syndrome. METHOD The clinical and radiological files were analyzed, and a bibliographic review was performed. RESULTS We present an 82 year old female with a four month history of hematuria, presenting in the emergency room where abnormal hepatic profile was documented. The diagnosis of bladder tumor was established and she underwent transurethral bladder resection. The pathological report showed transitional cell bladder cancer, with complete resection. Metastasis and infectious hepatic dysfunction were discarded. The hepatic profile became normal days later, so Stauffer's syndrome diagnosis was performed. CONCLUSION This is the first report to our knowledge of this paraneoplastic syndrome in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.</dc:description>
