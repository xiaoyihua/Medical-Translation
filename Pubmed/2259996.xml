<dc:description xml:lang="en">Following the World Health Organization guidelines, the Latin American Diarrheal Disease Control Programs have directed its efforts towards the promotion of Oral Hydration Therapy (OHT) and appropriate dietary management during the diarrheal episode and convalescent period, aimed at diminishing the mortality secondary to diarrhea. In developing countries, OHT is preventing, annually, one million of childhood deaths due to dehydration. Yet, only one fourth of the total population of children suffering diarrhea are being treated with this therapy. Among the strategies to decrease diarrhea morbidity, breast-feeding and hand washing are top priorities. The fundamental strategy has been to promote educational programs to train health personnel and community members. To continue these actions, we suggested the creation of more secondary and tertiary level hospitals and the installation of community units of OHT. They should become self-sufficient and self-manageable and include other programs of primary health care, such as immunization, growth and development surveillance, family planning and pregnancy control.</dc:description>
