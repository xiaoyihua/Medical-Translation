<dc:description xml:lang="en">Bernardino Ramazzini was a renowned physician and a prolific writer, born in Capri in 1633. He is considered the father of occupational medicine for having written the first paper on workers' diseases (De morbis artificum diatriba). His Treaty on Workers' diseases included 53 different professions, one particular and specific method of analysis, and a methodological proposal to prevent these diseases. This essay supports the approach taken by the father of occupational medicine and confirms that the principles established in his work are applicable to this day. A fair tribute is paid to the man and his writings in the third century after their publication. The English version of this paper is available at: http://www.insp.mx/salud/index.html.</dc:description>
