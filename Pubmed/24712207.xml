<dc:description xml:lang="en">Pirogoff amputation was originally described by Russian surgeon Nicholas Pirogoff in 1864. It refers to the osteoplastic amputation distal to the ankle joint, talus resection and bone fusion of the tibia and the calcaneus. Its advantages are as follows: less loss in limb length, the possibility of full weight bearing, and the use of a more anatomical prosthesis. We present herein two cases: a 38 year-old female patient who underwent Chopart amputation after a gunshot wound and developed a plantar flexion deformity that prevented proper use of the prosthesis; and a 39 year-old male with sequela of fibular hemimelia, with severe foot deformity preventing proper use of the extremity and footwear. This treatment is proposed as an alternative to traditional amputation levels, particularly in cases in which, due to the disease characteristics, foot reconstruction is not possible and therefore the possibility of a less radical and less limiting procedure is considered.</dc:description>
