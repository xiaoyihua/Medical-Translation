<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To discover the amount of tobacco and alcohol consumed by young people attending a primary care (PC) clinic. DESIGN Descriptive study lasting three months. SETTING The "V Centenario" Health Centre in San Sebastián de los Reyes, in the outskirts of Madrid. PARTICIPANTS All young people of both sexes between 15 and 25 (N = 159) who sought attention for any reason were included in the study. All of them were asked to fill in a questionnaire on their alcohol and tobacco consumption during the previous month. They were also administered the CAGE test and a MCV and GGT were requested. The results were analysed with the Chi squared test and by comparing averages. RESULTS Of the young people, 25.16% didn't drink, 53.46% did so with moderation and 21.38% were heavy drinkers. Males consumed more alcohol than women (p &lt; 0.001). "Weekend drinkers" made up 82.35% and consumed less alcohol per week than the "daily drinkers" (p &lt; 0.05). The CAGE test was associated with the stated enolic consumption (p &lt; 0.001). We found alterations in only 1% of the analyses. Of the sample, 47.80% smoked: 45% of the men and 50% of the women. CONCLUSIONS The percentage of drinkers is high and men consume more alcohol than women. "Weekend drinkers" predominate and have a lower overall intake than the "daily drinkers." The CAGE test is associated with the stated consumption. Anamnesis in private could be a fair indicator of enolic intake at this age. The MCV and GGT would not be useful. Half of young people smoke. Tobacco and alcohol use are linked.</dc:description>
