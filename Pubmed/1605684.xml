<dc:description xml:lang="en">We reviewed 149 cases of renal trauma that were seen at the Urology Service of Hospital de Navarra from January, 1975 to December, 1989. The severity of the renal injury, type (open or closed), the presence of previous lesions, renal changes, and the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were analyzed. The follow-up urologic and nephrologic controls are briefly described. Most of the cases with important renal injury have been followed for one to five years. We observed as increased incidence of renal injuries from road traffic accidents in younger patients with a prevalence in the male. Treatment is more conservative and less nephrectomies have been performed. CT, US, renal arteriography and isotope studies have become widely available. The endourological and transcutaneous techniques have been widely used in the treatment of these patients.</dc:description>
