<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND There are conflicting data concerning the alteration of cardiac function in diabetics without another type of accompanying pathology. Therefore this study was designed with the aim to analyze the anatomical and functional changes and relate them with the time and control of diabetes. METHODS Fifty-four type I diabetics with a mean age of 33.5 years and 25 healthy controls paired by age and sex were studied. The patients were rigourously selected excluding any disease or treatment other than insulin and the presence of demonstrated microangiopathy was required. M-mode and bidimensional echocardiographic studies were carried out in 46 patients to calculate thickness, cavity dimension and systolic function rates. Doppler-echo studies analyzing 9 parameters of diastolic function were performed in all the 54 patients studied. RESULTS The results obtained demonstrated significant differences in the thickness of the posterior wall and the septum in the diabetics in comparison with the normal subjects. No differences were observed in the parameters of systolic function with the diastolic parameters being significant. Considered globally 41% of the patients demonstrated structural alterations, 4% systolic and 70% diastolic. The only significant correlation was established between the diastolic alteration and the time of evolution of the diabetes. The autonomic alteration which some patients presented did not vary the results obtained. CONCLUSIONS In this group of selected diabetic structural and cardiac diastolic alterations appeared being attributed only to the diabetes itself in relation to the length of time of the same and possibly to the microangiopathy.</dc:description>
