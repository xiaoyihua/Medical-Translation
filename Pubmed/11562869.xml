<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The literature concerning the association between headache and arterial hypertension is very scarce, mostly prior to the actual IHS classification and based on very diverse methods, being therefore difficult to interpret. OBJECTIVES To analyse the association between arterial hypertension and two types of chronic headache and to determine, if and how arterial hypertension may affect the outcome of prophylactic therapy for chronic headaches. PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty four files of our headache outpatient clinic, chosen randomly among patients suffering from migraine or tensional type headache (TTH), were analysed retrospectively. Patients were considered hypertensive, if blood pressure was higher than normal several times without an acute crisis present. Resistance to treatment was defined as lack of benefit concerning number and/or intensity of crisis. RESULTS Age varied between 18 and 80 years, the mean age being 42,9 (SD 13,86) years. Eighty six percent were females. Twenty nine patients suffered from TTH and 35 from migraine. Prevalence of hypertension was 35,9% among all patients, 28,5% among migraine patients, 44,8% among patients with TTH. The prevalence of resistance to treatment was 39,8%, 34,3% and 41,3%, respectively. Of the patients resistant to treatment 60% were hypertensive and 62,5% of the hypertensive patients showed resistance to therapy. CONCLUSIONS Arterial hypertension was more prevalent in the study sample than would be expected in an equivalent sample of the general population. Hypertension was significantly more prevalent among patients resistant to therapy, as was resistance to treatment among hypertensive patients. We therefore conclude that there is a relevant comorbidity between chronic headache and hypertension and that arterial hypertension complicates the control of chronic headaches.</dc:description>
