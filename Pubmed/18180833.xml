<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The esophagus can suffer several motor disturbances of striated or smooth muscle. AIM To determine the presence of primary motor disturbances of the esophagus among a group of patients with esophageal symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective study of 5,440 patients consulting for heartburn, chest pain or dysphagia, with primary esophageal motor disturbances, studied between 1994 and 2004. AH were subjected to an esophageal manometry with eight perfused catheters connected to pressure transducers. RESULTS Nineteen percent of subjects had a normal esophageal manometry, 60% had unspecific motor disturbances usually associated to gastroesophageal reflux, 13% had a nutcracker esophagus, 5% had diffuse esophageal spasm, 2% had achalasia and 0,3% had an hypertensive sphincter. CONCLUSIONS Primary esophageal motor disturbances are common among patients with esophageal symptoms. A manometry should be performed to these patients.</dc:description>
