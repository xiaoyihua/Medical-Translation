<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES the postoperative evolution of patients submitted to orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) is frequently associated with the appearance of different types of complications such as renal failure, graft rejection, infections, and neurological disorders. These complications are the most significant causes of early morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing OLT. The purpose of the present study was the identification of factors related to the different postoperative complications after OLT. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN a prospective study was carried out. PATIENTS seventy-eight variables were analyzed in 32 consecutive patients undergoing OLT. The factors independently associated with the appearance of postoperative complications were identified using a stepwise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS the multivariate analysis showed that malondialdehyde and creatinine pretransplant serum levels were associated with the development of renal dysfunction. The pretransplant levels of haemoglobin and the units of platelets administered during surgery were prognostic factors of infections. Acute graft rejection was predicted by ?-glutamyl transpeptidase and total bilirubin serum levels. The pretransplant sodium and glutaredoxin levels in serum were associated with neurological complications. CONCLUSIONS we propose these markers for the identification of high-risk patients allowing an early surveillance and/or treatment to improve morbidity and survival in patients submitted to OLT.</dc:description>
