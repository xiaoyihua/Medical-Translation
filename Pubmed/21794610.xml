<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To study the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of all adults patients as having synovial sarcoma in the Hospital Xeral-Calde (Lugo) between 2002 and 2006. PATIENTS AND METHOD We conducted a retrospective study of the case records of all adults patients diagnosed with synovial sarcoma from January 2002 through December 2006. Patients were considered to be adults if they were more than 18. In all cases a tissue-biopsy sample showing synovial sarcoma was required. The Hospital Xeral-Calde is the only referral center for a population of almost 250.000 people. RESULTS Four cases (3 women) met the classification criteria for this study. The mean age was 35 years old (range, 22-41). The most common presentation was a palpable mass (mean 6.7cm.) associated with pain in lower extremities. The mean delay for the diagnosis was 17 months, but in one case has been noted as long as 2.5 years. Unlike the neck synovial sarcoma case, a long delay in the diagnosis implied a major tumor size and a higher histologic grade. The mean follow-up was 25.5 months; one patient died 1.5 years after the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS The overall annual incidence rate of synovial sarcoma in the Lugo region between January 2002 and 2006 for the population older than 18 years was a minimum estimate 0.32/10(5). Better physician awareness may contribute to the progressive increase in the recognition of this condition, especially in young people presenting with palpable mass. A long delay at the diagnosis implied a poor prognosis.</dc:description>
