<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Smoking is the most important risk factor for public health and one of the factors with the greatest economic repercussions for society. The aim of the present work is to publish the results of a programme to reduce smoking in the working environment. METHODS A programme was designed in two stages. The first consisted of carrying out a survey to establish the prevalence of smoking and the attitudes towards smoking of staff working for Salamanca district Council. The second stage consisted of a specialized treatment programme for all the workers who wanted to try to give up smoking. RESULTS A total of 384 workers answered the questionnaire. Of these, 135 (35.1%) were smokers of whom 80.5% (n = 113) wanted to give up smoking and to receive medical help to do so. A total of 73 workers started the programme. After one year of treatment, 41% of the workers who had started the programme had dropped out. An average of 2.9 of every 3 workers found the programme satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of smoking in Salamanca District Council is similar to that described in the National Health Survey, 1997. Programmes to treat smoking in the working environment are useful to reduce the prevalence of smoking and are welcomed by the workers. Reducing the prevalence of smoking is the first step towards achieving smoke-free institutions.</dc:description>
