<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment of asthmatic children by inhalation. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two hundred twenty-seven young patients have taken part in a practical inquiry regarding the handling of their inhalation device and showing how they attained the appropriate dosage of medicine by using either the direct pressurized aerosol, the dry powder device or pressurized aerosol in an expansion chamber. Five different steps have been observed in the handling of the above mentioned devices. After assembling the data, a profile has been compiled (through absolute and relative frequencies and a 95% confidence interval) and a logistic regression multivariant analysis. RESULTS Correct handling was observed in 37.2% of the children who used the dry powder device, 51.2% in the children who used the direct pressurized aerosol and 58.6% of those who used the expansion chamber aerosol. The influence of the duration of the treatment plus the age of the patient was also taken into consideration. CONCLUSIONS From this study it follows that the direct pressurized aerosol treatment and the dry powder device are incorrectly handled by a high percentage of children and this problem gets worse as the age of the patient increases. In contrast, the proportion of children who use correctly the expansion chamber aerosol is highest and remains similar for all age groups. Misusage increases when the explanation of the treatment is provided by the parents and also when the treatment occurs for a period greater than 22 months without reminding the patient of the correct usage of the apparatus.</dc:description>
