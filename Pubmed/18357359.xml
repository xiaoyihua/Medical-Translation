<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura presents as a multisystemic disease with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, fever, neurological and renal involvement. We report a 24 years-old male presenting with purpura and a generalized seizure. His blood tests showed an hemolytic anemia, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, increased lactated dehydrogenase, thrombocytopenia and impairment of renal function. He was initially treated with daily plasmapheresis and steroids without improvement. Due to persistence of the disease, he was treated with two doses of intravenous vincristine in four days, with clinical and laboratory improvement. He was discharged 40 days after the last dose of vincristine, in good conditions.</dc:description>
