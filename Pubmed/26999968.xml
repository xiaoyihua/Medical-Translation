<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this paper is to assess the results obtained with the arthroscopy-assisted surgical technique for the treatment of chronic acromioclavicular joint instability (CACJI), based on non-rigid coracoclavicular (CC) fixation and anatomical CC reconstruction with a tendinous allograft. Patients with CACJI who underwent surgery between 2008 and 2012 were included in the study. Clinical assessments included SF36, VAS and DASH, applied at the preoperative visit (POV) and at the last follow-up visit (LFUV). The Constant score and the General Satisfaction Score (0-10) were applied at the last follow-up visit. Occurrence of secondary subluxations was assessed. Ten patients were included; mean age was 41 years (range 33-55). Mean follow-up was 25.50 months (range 24-30). Surgical treatment was indicated in all patients after failure of conservative treatment. Questionnaires applied at the POV and the LFUV showed the following results: 1. SF36: physical, POV = 29.60 ± 3.41 and LFUV = 59.58 ± 1.98 (p = 0.000); 2. SF36 mental, POV = 46.57 ± 3.80 and LFUV = 56.62 ± 1.89 (p = 0.000); 3. VAS: POV = 5.17 ± 2.40 and LFUV: 1.67 ± 2.07 (p = 0.022); and 4. DASH: POV = 63.33 ± 23.56 and LFUV = 2.61 ± 1.79 (p = 0.000). The Constant score and the general satisfaction at the LFUV were 95.56 ± 3.28 and 9.22 ± 0.67, respectively. There were no secondary subluxations. Treatment of CACJI with a CC suspension device and arthroscopically-assisted anatomical reconstruction of CC ligaments may provide a significant quality of life improvement to patients. It is a strategy that, upon considering primary mechanical CC fixation, may minimize the chance of failure and occurrence of secondary subluxations.</dc:description>
