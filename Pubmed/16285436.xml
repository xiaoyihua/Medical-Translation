<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE This study is presented to help define the role of radiotherapy in the management of buccopharyngeal epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 1999 and December 2004, we treated 17 patients who had acquired inmunodeficiency syndrome related to mucous Kaposi's sarcoma. Kaposi's sarcoma lesions were in the oral cavity in 12 patients (70%), oropharynx in 3 patients (18%) and larynx in 2 patients (12%). All the patients were treated by radiotherapy using a Cobalt Unit beam energy, the treatment doses ranged from 15 to 30 Gy. RESULTS Tolerance was generally satisfactory, with an effective palliation of symptoms (88,4% overall rate of objective responses). Nevertheless an enhanced mucosal reaction was noted in patients receiving doses close to 30 Gy (mucositis grade 3). CONCLUSIONS We conclude that radiotherapy is an efficient treatment for mucous epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma; a dose of 15 Gy may be enough to shrink the tumour and obtain a good palliation of symptoms. Prophylactic measures with antifungal treatment should be systematically associated with oropharyngeal irradiation in order to improve tolerance to the treatment.</dc:description>
