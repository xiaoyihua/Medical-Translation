<dc:description xml:lang="es">Hydatidosis continues to be an important cause of morbimortality in several parts of the world. The definitive diagnosis of the hepatic disease depends on the combination of imaging techniques and serological studies. Surgery continues to be the preferred treatment, especially in the case of large or complicated cysts. We present the clinical case of a 5-year-old patient in whom, during a routine examination, an abdominal mass located in the right hypochondrium was found. The patient had been in contact with a dog that was properly de wormed. Through an ultrasound scan and abdominal NMR imaging a hepatic cyst measuring 11 cm in diameter was diagnosed. The serology confirms the etiology since it shows a titre of antibodies against Echinococcus of 1/128. In view of the size of the cyst the chosen treatment was surgery consisting of a cystectomy. Both the study of the cystic fluid (Echinococcus granulosus are seen) as well as the histology of the surgical specimen are diagnostic of a hydatid cyst. The patient&#146;s clinical evolution was satisfactory, with the antibodies against Echinococcus becoming negative after the patient had been followed up for a year(AU)</dc:description>
