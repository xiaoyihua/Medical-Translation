<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The present study analyzed the indications for laparoscopic surgery in cryptorchidism. METHODS The clinical, surgical and anatomopathological data of 2000 cryptorchid testes submitted to surgery from 1972 to 1993 were reviewed. RESULTS 17.75% (355 testes) were not palpable at physical examination; of these, 3.45% (69 cases) were anorchid and only 5.4% (108 testes) of the remaining 14.3% were true intra-abdominal testes. The other 8.9% were localized elsewhere. Scrotal descent was achieved only by funiculolysis in 68% of the cases. The remaining 28% (30 testes, since the technique used was not reported in 5) were brought to the scrotum using two-stage procedures, Stephen-Fowler and autotransplantation (one case), which could have been replaced or preceded by laparoscopy. Of the 30 testes, 10 were removed. CONCLUSIONS Since only 5% (20 testes) can benefit from laparoscopic techniques and, moreover, 68% have a very low tubular fertility index and there is an increased possibility of progressing to malignancy, if other than standard surgical techniques are warranted in cases with unilateral cryptorchidism, testis removal is preferable, which further reduces the application of laparoscopy in cryptorchidism.</dc:description>
