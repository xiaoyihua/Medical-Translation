<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In the last 15 years a number of autoantibodies against antigens of the peripheral nervous system have been associated, in some cases, to specific clinical features. DEVELOPMENT Antibodies to MAG or gangliosides have been described in neuropathies associated to monoclonal gammopathy or inflammatory polyneuropathies, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome or multifocal motor neuropathy. A lot of research is devoted to the characterization of known antibodies to glycolipids and the discovery of new ones. Furthermore, experimental models both with animals and in vitro preparations are performed in order to unravel the possible immunopathological role of these antibodies. CONCLUSIONS It is very important to define the clinical features of these patients precisely in order to establish consistent associations between: presence of antibodies to specific antigens of the peripheral nervous system and clinical syndromes. A deeper knowledge of the antigens and antibodies involved in these neuropathies may be very helpful in the follow-up of these patients and also for future therapies.</dc:description>
