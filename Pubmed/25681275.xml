<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Several reports have been published in relation to complications, sometimes fatal, associated to endoscopic ventriculocisternostomy (EVC). The objective of this study was to determine the range of complications using this surgical technique in a series of 108 patients. METHODS A retrospective and descriptive study was performed on 108 hydrocephalic patients: 76 children and 32 adults. All of them presented various forms of obstructive hydrocephalus. RESULTS In a total of 108 patients, 114 EVC were performed. The follow-up period ranged between 6 months and 10 years (mean 6.8 years). Age of patients ranged from 6 days to 75 years old (mean 18 years). Aqueductal stenosis was the most common aetiology, with 62 patients (57.4%). Significant complications occurred in 10 patients (9.2%). During the course of the study, the complication rate dropped significantly. No patient died because of the procedure (mortality 0%). We applied the Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy Success Score (ETVSS) developed by Kulkarni and collaborators to our series to know if this score could be useful in predicting ETV results. CONCLUSION Like all minimally-invasive techniques, there is a steep learning curve for EVC. Correct patient selection and surgeon experience (which means not only familiarity with endoscopic techniques but also the performance of a minimum number of surgeries per year) are very important to avoid complications. The ETV Success Score devised closely approximates the predicted probability of ETV success.</dc:description>
