<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The epidemiologic characteristics of HIV infection in La Rioja (Spain) were studied and the future tendencies of the same analyzed. METHODS The data from official Health sources were collected and analyzed. RESULTS In La Rioja, the 5th region in Spain regarding to AIDS incidence, the duplication time of the number of cases continues to shorten. The number in December 1991 was 81. The heterosexual route of infection was 5% of the cases of AIDS up to December 1990 and in 1991 it was 15%, while, with regards to the total number of seropositive subjects, the number rose from 0.3% in December 1990 to 10% in 1991. One thousand one hundred fifty-one seropositive patients were detected in December 1991 representing seroprevalence of 0.34% which reaches 1.14% in the age range between 18-32 years. Mean hospital stay was 23.6 days with 3,032 hospital stays calculated for 1991 representing 8.3 occupied beds/day. There are presently 92 patients undergoing antiviral treatment. Between 43-69 new cases of AIDS have been calculated for 1992. CONCLUSIONS 1) Medical care should be provided to a greater number of seropositive people to avoid early deterioration. 2) The increase in heterosexual infection is alarming. 3) The need for rehabilitation centers for drug abusers and social alternatives to prostitution is clear. 4) Organized campaigns pointing out and returning the dignity and value of life and therewith the role of human sexuality are needed. 5) Alternative means to conventional hospitalization is required.</dc:description>
