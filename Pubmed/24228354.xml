<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Diaphragmatic paralysis may result difficulty for respiratory compromise and extubation. We study the effectiveness of diaphragmatic plication held in its two modalities: videothoracoscopy assisted surgery (VATS) and percutaneous with needle. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective study of diaphragmatic plication performed in our center in the past three years. Review of clinical histories, analyzing the variables: sex and age, etiology and laterality, surgical indications, technique, ventilation support, complications and outcome. Data Analysis with SPSS 18.0. RESULTS From 2009-2012, 24 diaphragmatic plication were realized (7 left, 13 right, 2 bilateral) in 22 children (15 males). The mean age was 10.4 months (2 to 23.1). In 68.1% paralysis was secondary to thoracic surgery. In 12 patients was performed VATS and in 5 percutaneous with needle. Surgical indications were: respiratory distress (69.1%) with intercurrent processes (pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and atelectasis) and failure of extubation in 27.3%. After diaphragmatic plication in 90.9% respiratory symptoms remitted. Extubation was accomplished in all patients, requiring ventilator support for 12-96 hours. Mean hospital stay was 7.5 days (3 to 13.5). There were no complications derived from surgery. There were two recurrences (9.2%) and only one was reoperated (4.6%). The percutaneous technique decreased the required postoperative analgesia and improved cosmetic outcome in 90.9%. CONCLUSIONS The diaphragmatic plication by minimally invasive surgery reduces operative morbidity and facilitates extubation of ventilator-dependent patients with diaphragmatic paralysis. The percutaneous technique improves the cosmetic results and reduces pain after surgery, without finding differences with VATS.</dc:description>
