<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present the results and follow up of ductus arteriosus closure with the Rashkind device. Sixty-six devices were implanted in 63 patients, 41 women and 22 men, with a mean age of 8.2 years. We determined the diameter of the duct, the presence or absence of immediate residual leak at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and every year of follow-up by ecocardiography. The hemodynamic determinations showed: type A morphology in 49, type C in 7 and type E in 7; with a mean diameter of 4.2 +/- 1.4 mm (range of 2.3 to 8.7 mm) and a Qp/Qs 2.2 +/- 1.5 (range 0.7 to 8.6). Forty-five 17 mm devices and 18 of 12 mm were used. The incidence of immediate residual leak was 65% (n-41); at 24 hrs. Post-procedure was 31.7% (n-20) and at one year 7.9% (n-5). Three patients with persistent leak had implantation of a second Rashkind device and one more patient an endovascular coil, the other patient is waiting for a second occlusor. Minor complications occurred in 15.8% (n-10). Results show an occlusion rate at 24 hrs of 68% and at one year of 92%; no patient presented migration of the device, hemolysis or obstruction of the pulmonary artery branches. We consider that occlusion of the ductus arteriosus with the Rashkind device is a safe and effective option for the treatment of this pathology.</dc:description>
