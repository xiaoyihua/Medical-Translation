<dc:description xml:lang="en">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in previously healthy adults is rare, but the overall mortality rate is 40-60%. Inhaled ribavirin is approved for the treatment of hospitalized infants and young children with severe lower respiratory tract infections due to RSV. We present the case of an adult female with RSV pneumonia-induced ARDS who was successfully treated with inhaled ribavirin and whose pulmonary function was restored to near normal. The role of inhaled ribavirin in adults is controversial, but it might have a therapeutic potential for severe RSV infection-induced ARDS in adults.</dc:description>
