<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report our experience with the treatment of patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis. The sample was small because the disease is rare. The therapeutic techniques first used were arytenoidopexy using King's technique and Graff-Woodman's arytenoidectomy with cordopexy. Cordectomy was used when other techniques failed. Nine of 11 patients were decannulated successfully. Tracheotomy was maintained in the other 2 for reasons unrelated with the initial picture. Breathing and voice quality were acceptable in all patients. Complications were limited to aspiration pneumonia. Cordectomy was necessary in 3 cases because conservative treatment was insufficient. Although the development of new techniques for treating this problem should continue, classic techniques remain valid. A case of paralysis caused by nitrocuanitin intoxication is reported.</dc:description>
