<dc:description xml:lang="en">The results of the Spanish registry for electrophysiology and arrhythmias activity are presented. A questionnaire was sent to all of the Arrhythmia Units in Spain, directed to their human and technical resources, and activity. The questionnaire was designed by the Section of electrophysiology and Arrhythmias of the Spanish. Society of Cardiology. The existence of an arrhythmia Unit, as an autonomous center, was recognized in 26 cases, at the end of 1995. In 13 centers there was no Arrhythmia Unit, but 11 wanted to develop one and in 2 it was not considered. Seven centers expected to create an Arrhythmia Unit during 1996. The first Arrhythmia Unit in spain was created in 1979. We have considered as a basic requirement the functional existence of a specific cardiac electrophysiological laboratory. Only 34 hospitals already have a Laboratory and 5 are waiting for the development of one. In 21 hospitals there are cardiologists particularly dedicated to electrophysiology, the number varies between 1 and 3 in each hospital. Radiofrequency catheter ablation is now considered the technique of choice for the treatment of most cardiac arrhythmias. This technique is currently being performed in Spain in 29 Hospitals and an additional 4 are expected to be able to perform it in the near future. Twenty-five hospitals implant automatic defibrillators, and the mean defibrillators implanted per hospital and year is 9.8 +/- 10.1.</dc:description>
