<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Male stress urinary incontinence is usually a consequence or sequel of a prostatic surgical procedure (radical prostatectomy, surgery for BPH or bladder neck sclerosis: adenomectomy, conventional and/or bipolar transurethral resection, laser...). This kind of surgery may have undesirable effects on the quality of life and patients' expectations, although we should bear in mind that the primary objective in patients with prostate adenocarcinoma is to cure cancer and for patients with obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms to improve their voiding quality Over the last decade, surgical procedures to compress the bulbar urethra with slings have been employed successfully in the treatment of male stress urinary incontinence, being considered highly effective in the treatment of post-prostatectomy incontinence in the long-term by groups with large experience. To describe the elements of the Argus system, its indications, and the surgical technique for its implant and adjustment, modified from Schäeffer and carried out by Victor Romano. METHODS Argus system: The sling has three components: radiopaque cushioned system with silicone foam, 42 mm x 26 mm x 9 mm, which is waterproof to body fluids; two silicone columns formed by multiple conical elements, which allow system readjustment; and two radiopaque silicone washers (15 mm diameter and 2.9 mm width) which enable proper fixation and readjustment (Figure 1). Once the system is open, it is recommended to place the sling within antibiotic solution until implantation. CONCLUSIONS 1. It is a safe, easy to implant, reproducible system, with few complications and a good cost-benefit relation. 2. Results are comparable to the gold standard, but it has the following advantages: immediate voiding control recovery and no need for patient training. 3. This article does not intend to show our short experience with only five cases, but we want to mention that all of them are continent with a good quality of life. 4. Our objective will be to publish our results when we can show a minimal follow-up.</dc:description>
