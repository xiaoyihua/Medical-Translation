<dc:description xml:lang="en">One of the most important problems faced by nephrologists is the high degree of cardiovascular mortality in patients on dialysis. This increase in cardiovascular disease has been associated with various factors, but, among them, hyperphosphatemia stands out particularly. The serum phosphate levels considered normal in these patients have gradually decreased in recent years. Therefore, phosphate control in the chronic kidney disease patient has become a challenge that has stimulated basic research in recent years. The aim of the following review is to bring together the most novel results presented in the last year, with emphasis on the methods for control of phosphate absorption, its elimination by the kidneys and vascular calcifications, which are one of the most serious direct consequences of hyperphosphatemia.</dc:description>
