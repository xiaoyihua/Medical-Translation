<dc:description xml:lang="es">It has long been known that the sleep-wake cycle is closely related to the body temperature rhythm, in such a way that sleep propensity increases when the core body temperature (CBT) reaches a minimun value. However, the unpleasantness associated with the methods used for continuous CBT recordings has recently increased the interest for peripheral temperature (PT) measurements as an index of sleepeness. The peripheral temperature pattern is opposed to that of CBT with respect to sleep, since the propensity to fall asleep increases along with PT, while PT decrements are associated with alertness. Changes in peripheral temperature rhythm precede those of CBT, highlighting its endogenous component, and demonstrating that PT acts as a signal for sleep regulating centers. In addition, more recent data indicates that, under the circadian sistem control, CBT lowering is specially dependent on heat loss by skin vasodilation and heating, which means that it is the PT increment, rather than the CBT drop, which triggers sleep onset and its consolidation. Based on this assumption a number of behavioral pattern modifications can be suggested to improve those thermoregutranslatory changes that could facilitate sleep (AU)</dc:description>
