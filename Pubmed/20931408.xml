<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Nowadays the study of vulnerability to psychosis and early intervention is an area of great clinical impact and research. The aim of this study was to adapt the Wisconsin Scales of Vulnerability to Psychosis from English to Spanish. A set of five scales (Magical Ideation, Perceptual Aberration, Physical Anhedonia, Revised Social Anhedonia and Ambivalence) assess schizotypal traits in the general population and the possible risk of developing disorders embedded in the psychotic spectrum. Additionally, this tool contains a scale of Hypomaniac Personality to detect risk of affective spectrum psychosis. METHODOLOGY The Wisconsin Scales of Vulnerability to Psychosis have been adapted following the back-translation method. The scales were translated to an original Spanish version, which was then translated again into English in order to assess the conceptual and semantic overlap with the original items. RESULTS All the items were back-translated and evaluated in respect to the original ones by an expert in the scales, and all of them were rated with a perfect equivalence (Type A) or satisfactory (Type B). CONCLUSIONS The Spanish version of the Wisconsin Scales of Vulnerability to Psychosis shows good equivalence with the English one, thus allowing to measure affective and schizotypal traits in samples of Spanish-speaking individuals properly. Future studies should test the reliability and validity of these scales in our environment.</dc:description>
