<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Gastrostomy tube is the best option for long-term enteral nutrition. Among its limitations, infections represent the most frequent minor complication. Our aim is the knowledge of the number and type of gastrostomy tubes and its main indication in our hospital. In addition, prevalence of infectious complications was studied paying attention to the main etiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility. METHODS Observational retrospective study from January 2010 to July 2015 through the electronic clinical history and the clinical microbiology laboratory software. Identification and antibiotic susceptibility of clinically significant isolates from patients with suspicion of gastrostomy tube infection have been analysed. RESULTS Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was performed in 203 patients (70.5%) and surgical gastrostomy in 85 (29.5%). The main reason identified for starting enteral nutrition through gastrostomy tube was malignant neoplasy, above all, lip, oral cavity and pharynx cancer (11.8%) and that from digestive organs (8.7%). Global prevalence of gastrostomy tube infection was 16.6%. The most common bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (21.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.1%), and Escherichia coli (9.8%). The percentage of multi resistant isolates was 3.1%. CONCLUSIONS Gastrostomy tube indications and type, and also, prevalence and microorganisms isolated from culture in infectious complications are similar to those described previously in the literature. The study allows the adaptation of the antibiotic prophylaxis and empirical antibiotic treatment thanks to the knowledge of the etiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility.</dc:description>
