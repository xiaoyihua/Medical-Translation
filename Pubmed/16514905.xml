<dc:description xml:lang="en">Either inflammation or hyperuricemia has been related with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality. A hypothetical relationship between serum uric acid levels (SUA) and inflammatory markers has never been tested in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in CKD patients, and to test the hypothesis of a relationship between SUA and CRP levels. The study group consisted of 337 patients (174 males, mean age 63 +/- 16 years) with advanced chronic renal failure not yet on dialysis. None of them had overt inflammatory or infectious diseases. High sensitivity CRP levels were analyzed as a binary (above or below median value), or continuous variable (log-transformed CRP), by multiple logistic or linear regression analysis, respectively. Demographics, clinical, and biochemical characteristics, including SUA levels, were the variables tested in these analysis. In a subset of 169 patients without diabetes, the same analysis were carried out, with the inclusion of fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR as independent variables. Median CRP level was 3.25 mg/L, and mean SUA level was 7.59 +/- 1.94 mg/dl. Patients with CRP levels above the median had significantly higher mean SUA level than that of the rest of study patients (7.93 +/- 1.79 vs 7.24 +/- 2.03 mg/dl, p = 0.001). SUA levels correlated significantly with log-transformed CRP levels (r = 0. 16, p = 0.0022). The relationship between SUA and CRP levels remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, sex, comorbid index, obesity, residual renal function, diuretic and allopurinol treatment, in the multivariate logistic and linear regression models (OR: 1.296, p = 0.0003; and beta: 0.204, p = 0.0002). The significant association between SUA and CRP levels did not change when HOMA-IR and fasting insulin levels were included as independent variables in the subset of 169 patients without diabetes. In conclusion, SUA levels are related with CRP levels in CKD patients.</dc:description>
