<dc:description xml:lang="en">The prevalence of reported self-medication and compliance and some associated factors in patients 25 and over years of age attending a primary health center is studied using the case finding method, during the period of March-December, 1987. Self-medication was reported by 48% of patients (41% were taking one drug and 7% two drugs). Nervous system drugs were the most common pharmacologic group over the counter. As for compliance of prescribed drugs, 81% reported to take their medication in the prescribed way at least 3 out of 4 times. Younger patients reported more self-medication. Non compliance was more frequent in members of larger families. No other statistical differences were found. We conclude that the patients in our practice report a high level of self-medication and also a high level of compliance of prescribed drugs. These data are to be taken into account for the planning of future health programs targeted to the use of drugs in our community.</dc:description>
