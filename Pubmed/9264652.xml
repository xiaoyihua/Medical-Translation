<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Due to the high morbidity of bacterial illnesses, there have been a lot of studies to assess the use of antibacterials. These studies usually focus on a small sample, whereas in the present study both the development of the use of antimicrobials in non-hospital care throughout Catalonia, and the extent to which new medicines are used, are examined. DESIGN A retrospective, observational study. SETTING Catalonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS Using the data supplied by the pharmacy data base of the Catalan Health Service in DHD for 1992-1995, analyses were made of the development in the use of the different antibacterial subgroups, the effect of using new medicines and their impact on similar older antibacterials. MAIN RESULTS The overall number of antibacterials taken in Catalonia remained fairly stable at high levels. CONCLUSIONS Antibacterials are widely used. Three is a tendency to substitute newly marketed medicines for traditional medicines. A more prudent attitude should be adopted when starting antibacterials treatments and choosing the most suitable antibiotics for non-hospital care.</dc:description>
