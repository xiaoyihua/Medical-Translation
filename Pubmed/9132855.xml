<dc:description xml:lang="en">This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical response of 51 cutaneous lesions of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma in patients with AIDS (EKS/AIDS), obtained with the use of a scheme of superficial radiotherapy (3 Gy/fraction, three fractions weekly up to a total dose of 30 Gy). The mean follow-up time was 9.3 months and the mean time to progression of EKS/AIDS disease was 7-8 months. The initial clinical parameters (pain, size, edema, and esthetics) of each cutaneous lesion were compared with those obtained after one week, one month and three months of therapy. An objective pain improvement was observed in 72% of early lesions and with statistic significance (after one week p = 0.003). After one month of therapy a decrease in lesion size, edema, and esthetic improvement was observed in 78%, 71% and 77%, respectively. Although the evolution and prognosis of EKS/AIDS remains unchanged, it indeed provided palliation, with improvement of local control and esthetics, which together with the simplicity of its application and absence of untoward effects render this radiotherapy technique a very useful indication.</dc:description>
