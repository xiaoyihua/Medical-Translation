<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Lipoprotein lipase plays a crucial role in plasma lipoprotein metabolism. Several lipoprotein lipase gene polymorphisms have been found associated with lipid levels, premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. AIM To investigate, in the Chilean population, the genotype distribution of lipoprotein lipase polymorphisms and its possible association with lipid levels and obesity. PATIENTS AND METHODS Hind III and Pvu II polymorphism was determined in 45 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients and in 52 non diabetic controls from Santiago, Chile. RESULTS Hind III (+/+) polymorphism had a higher frequency in diabetics as compared to controls (0.6 and 0.29 respectively, p = 0.009). The frequency of heterozygous distribution was higher in non diabetic subjects. Controls and diabetics had comparable gene frequencies for the Pvu II genotype distribution. Analyzing the impact of these polymorphisms on plasma lipid levels, Hind III (+/+) genotype was associated with high levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides in both groups. The heterozygote (+/-) or homozygote (-/-) state for Hind III was effectively associated with high levels of HDL cholesterol levels, as compared to the (+/+) genotype. There was no relationship between these genotypes and body mass index and waist to hip ratio. CONCLUSIONS An association between genetic variation at the lipoprotein lipase locus with high levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol was confirmed. However, no association of these genetic markers with anthropometric measurements was found.</dc:description>
