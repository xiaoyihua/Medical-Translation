<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the current state of Rheumatology in Catalonia (Spain) and to update information regarding previous studies STUDY DESIGN observational, descriptive and transversal. SAMPLE Physicians practicing rheumatology in the public system of Catalonia. An epidemiological questionnaire was sent to all rheumatologists. The results were compared with previously published studies. RESULTS Information was obtained on 130 rheumatologists (62 men/68 women, mean age 47±9 years). Seventy five (57.7%) physicians worked at a hospital, 5 (3.8%) in primary care and 50 (38.5%) in both. Seven (11.9%) hospitals had no rheumatologist. Eight hospitals were accredited by the National Commission to develop a training program in Rheumatology. The number of residents accredited by each hospital was variable. CONCLUSIONS The number of rheumatologists in the public health sector in Catalonia has increased 4.8% during the last seven years, unlike the 2005 study in which there was an increase of 40% over the previous eight years. There were 7 hospitals without a rheumatologist.</dc:description>
