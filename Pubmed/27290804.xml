<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Obstetric fistulas in developed countries are infrequent and have been associated with instrumental vaginal delivery, manual removal of placenta and surgical complications during caesarean section. We present the diagnosis and treatment of an obstetric fistula of patient without clear risk factors in a developed country. CASE REPORT The case presented is of a 37 weeks pregnant with history of previous cesarean section. A male of 2,600 g was born after a not prolonged vaginal delivery. In the immediate postpartum period, appeared evident hematuria and in the exploration a defect was detected in the vaginal anterior face at 3 cm from the urethral meatus. Cystoscopy showed a torn in bladder of 8 cm at the bottom. Reparation of vesicovaginal fistula was carried out with omentoplasty. Postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSION A vesicovaginal fistula must be considered in any patient with hematuria. Early repair is essential for a favorable outcome.</dc:description>
