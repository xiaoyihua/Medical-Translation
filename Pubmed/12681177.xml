<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Ostium secundum-type atrial septal defect (ASD) is usually well tolerated, without severe complications in childhood. However, in many patients its effect on growth is disproproportionate when compared with that of more serious congenital heart disease. OBJECTIVES To test the hypothesis that hemodynamic disturbances are responsible for failure to thrive in congenital heart disease, we studied growth and the effect of surgical repair in children with ASD. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study was performed in 72 patients who underwent surgery at a mean age of 8 years and 8 months. The mean follow-up was 17 months. Somatometric and hemodynamic parameters were studied and the correlation between them was verified. The effect of surgery and of age at operation on somatometric changes was evaluated. RESULTS Fifty-two percent of the patients were malnourished and height was affected in 28 %. The correlation between weight and age at operation was r 5 0.78 (p &lt; 0.05) for the entire group, r 5 0.81 (p &lt; 0.05) for the malnourished subgroup and r 5 0.88 (p &lt; 0.05) for the subgroup with normal nutrition. No relationship was found between hemodynamic and somatometric parameters. Surgery improved growth disturbances but not in all patients (weight: from 52 % to 32 %; height: from 28 % to 16 %). CONCLUSIONS Hemodynamic factors are not the only cause of growth and nutritional alterations.</dc:description>
