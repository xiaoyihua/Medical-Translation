<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The damage of the lower urinary tract is originated by complications of obstetric or gynecological surgery, which if not detected timely determines the formation of fistulas. OBJECTIVE To analyze the experience in diagnosing and treating vesicovaginal fistulas attended at the gynecologic urology clinic of the Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia (INPer). MATERIAL AND METHOD Retrospective study of 27 files of patients diagnosed with vesicovaginal fistula at the gynecologic urology clinic of the INPer from January 11 1992 trough December 31st 2005. The variables analyzed were age, parity, corporal mass index, surgical history, surgery performed to correct the fistula and postoperative evolution. Averages and standard deviation were calculated to describe data. RESULTS Average age was 38.2 years. Abdominal hysterectomy (53.3%), followed by obstetric hysterectomy (33.3%), caused the most of complications. The most often used techniques to correct the fistula were Latzko operation, 19 patients (45.23%), and Sims' fistulectomy, 11 patients (26.19%). The most used drainage was Foley probes, with 9.1 days average of use. Urinary tract infection was the most common complication (6.7%). CONCLUSIONS. After our analysis, surgical treatment to patients with vesicovaginal fistula showed good results (71.4% of healing) with a minimum of complications (28.5% of recurrence).</dc:description>
