<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The authors' objective is to report the initial appreciations on the use of the intraoperative near-infrared indocyanine green videoangiography during aneurysm surgery in our center. METHOD 10 surgical procedures have been made in 9 patients, 5 males and 4 females between 27 and 61 years old with an average of age of 49 years during a time of 10 months between March, 2008 and January, 2009. 10 surgical procedures were performed and 11 aneurysms were clipped. Intravenous indocyanine green and surgical microscope Leica OH4 with module of vascular fluorescence intraoperating Leica FL800, with camera infrared Sony (Heerbrugg-Switzerland) were used. The information offered by this technique during the intervention is compared with the images of the postoperative angiography performed during the first 24 hours. The partial or complete occlusion and the respect to the near vessels were evaluated. RESULTS The findings of the intraoperative videoangiography were the complete occlusion and absence of complications in all the cases. These results corresponded completely with the postoperative results of the angiography postoperative, except in a case where the angiography demonstrated vasoespasmo moderate without clinical repercussion that during the videoangiografía intraoperatoria was not perceived. Clinically no patient presented neurological added deficits. CONCLUSIONS The intraoperative videoangiography is a tool of easy application that offers valuable information as for the complete occlusion of the aneurysm and the permeability of the adjacent vessels.</dc:description>
