<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The genetic makeup of the host contributes to the clinical profile of dengue. This could be due to the effect of variants in the genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between the variants of three polymorphisms in TNFA, IL6 and IFNG candidate genes with dengue severity in a sample of Colombian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated the rs1800750, rs2069843, and rs2069705 polymorphisms in TNFA, IL6 and IFNG candidate genes, respectively, in 226 patients with dengue infection. The genotypes were typed using both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). To determine the risk of different dengue phenotypes, we compared allele frequencies with chi-square and genotypes and haplotypes using logistic regression. Finally, these analyzes were adjusted with data from self-identification or the ancestral genetic component. RESULTS The A allele in the rs2069843 polymorphism, adjusted by self-identification, was associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever cases in Afro-Colombians. In the entire sample, this polymorphism, adjusted by the ancestral genetic component, was reproducible. In addition, there were significant associations between GGT and GAC allelic combinations of rs1800750, rs2069843, and rs2069705 in dengue hemorrhagic fever patients, with and without adjustment by ancestral genetic component. Additionally, the AGC allelic combination produced 58.03 pg/ml of interleukin-6 more than the GGC combination, regardless of European, Amerindian and African genetic components. CONCLUSIONS The variants of GGT and GAC polymorphisms of rs1800750, rs2069843, and rs2069705 in the TNFA, IL6 and IFNG genes, respectively, were correlated with the susceptibility to dengue severity in a sample of Colombian population.</dc:description>
