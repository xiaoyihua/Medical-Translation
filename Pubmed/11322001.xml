<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess inhalation technique in out-patient attending a respiratory ward who were using inhaler devices, and to identify factors associated with misuse of these therapies. METHOD One hundred and seven patients were prospectively studied, of whom 100 completed the study; Inhalation technique was evaluated using a previously elaborated check list. We searched for significant differences between individuals with good or bad inhalation technique. RESULTS Mean age: 68 +/- 11 years. 68 males and 32 females. Only 31% of cases were observed to make no inhalation errors when first evaluated. Individuals using metered-dose inhalers without spacer chamber made significantly more mistakes than patients using other devices. The main factor associated with poor inhalation technique was found to be the absence of adequate supervised instruction when the treatment was first prescribed. General practitioners were less likely to offer this instruction than other specialists. We did not find significant associations between inhaler misuse and patients' age, sex or the setting (hospital or ambulatory ward) where the treatment was first prescribed. CONCLUSIONS Incorrect use of inhalers is a frequent finding, and an adequate instruction seems to associate with improvement of patients' skills with use of these devices. Health personnel should be aware that inhalation technique instruction is essential ingredient of patients' management.</dc:description>
