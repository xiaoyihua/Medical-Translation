<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Insulin pump therapy aims to improve glycemic control and decrease the risk of hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes. OBJECTIVE To evaluate interstitial glucose levels and the frequency, duration and symptoms of hypo- and hyperglycemia through the use of a continuous glucose monitoring system (GGMS) in children and adolescents with insulin pump-treated type 1 diabetes, and to determine whether this monitoring method is well tolerated by these patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD Thirteen patients (4 boys) with insulin pump-treated type 1 diabetes mellitus were monitored. Age was 10.6±3.5 (range, 3.2-13.6) years, diabetes duration was 5.0±3.2 years, pump therapy duration was 12.0±4.6 months, insulin dose was 0.99 ± 0.19 U/kg/day, and last hemoglobin A1c level was 7.1% ± 0.8%. The Minimed CGMS was used for 72 hours. RESULTS A 3-year-old preschool child did not tolerate the CGMS. Interstitial glucose concentration was 187±40 mg/dl. Hypoglycemia (below 70mg/dl) accounted for 3.6% ± 5.6% of total time, while hyperglycemia (above 180 mg/dl) occurred 47.3% ± 17.4% of the time. No asymptomatic hypoglycemia episodes were detected. CONCLUSIONS Insulin pump-treated children and adolescents showed an irregular interstitial glucose level and did not achieve normoglycemia. In our patients, adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia were preserved and the CGMS was generally well tolerated.</dc:description>
