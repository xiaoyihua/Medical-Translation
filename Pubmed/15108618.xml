<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Non traumatic epistaxis seems to be clustering in different periods. This paper tries to find out if there is any relationship between incidence of epistaxis and the year season, month, week, day, hour and/or lunar phase. METHODS We have retrospectively studied 754 episodes seen between May 2001 and April 2002 in our Hospital. The following parameters were registered in each patient: age, sex, number of episodes, season, month, week, day, hour and lunar phase. RESULTS Epistaxis represented 12.1% of the total otolaryngological emergencies. That means an incidence of 0.1% of non traumatic epistaxis which needed hospital specialized attention. We found statistical differences (p = 0.003) in the number of epistaxis per day and the different months (greater in june and november). No differences were found in the remaining periods studied. CONCLUSIONS This paper shows monthly clustering of epistaxis episodes.</dc:description>
