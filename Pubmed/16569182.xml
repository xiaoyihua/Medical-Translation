<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To review the maximum stability of thermolabile drugs at room temperature (22-25 degrees C) in order to quickly act in case of breakage of the cold chain. METHOD The study included all drugs available in the pharmacy service from August 17, 2004 to October 15 of the same year, date in which the review was performed, that had to be kept at a temperature ranging between 2 degrees and 8 degrees C. Different drug laboratories were contacted and asked for written information on the matter. RESULTS The results are reported in a table. One hundred seventy three medicinal products including 83 drugs were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS Some information provided by the pharmaceutical industry allows the use of drugs even when the cold chain has been broken. This information must be used only in isolated cases, not as a routine.</dc:description>
