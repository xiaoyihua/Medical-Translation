<dc:description xml:lang="en">The need of new alternatives for the treatment of the chronic hepa - titis C, the appearance of the new antiviral ones that act directly on the cycle of replicación of the virus C, so called antiviral agents, they have never supposed a spectacular advance in the increase of the rates of treatment, so much for the patients before treated or naive. This new stage of the treatment is going to be, undoubtedly, more complex and, for this reason, a still major specialization will need if it is necessary to obtain an ideal managing of the patients. In addition, that these new medicaments will carry a significant increase of the expense associated with this pathology, key circumstance in the frame of economic context and of difficulty in the sustainability that Spanish public suffers the sanitary system, the individualization and the establishment of the factors that can predict the maximum benefit of every type of therapy turns out to be priority. The predictive factors of response that can affect the capture of decisions clinical practice are the stadium of fibrosis, the favorable genotype of the IL28B and the attainment of viral rapid response. The undoubted impact, so much welfare as pharmacoeconomic that the arrival of boceprevir and telaprevir will have in the hospitable centers forces us to the optimization and consensus in the use of these medicaments and to the exigency of obtaining the maximum of answers of the same ones. The latter aspect is very tied to the accomplishment of a followup pharmaceutical individualized and of quality, based on a model of Pharmaceutical Care centred on basic props as the involution of the adherence, given the additional complexity that add the new medicaments, the identification, prevention and managing of the adverse effects inherent in the triple therapy. Besides it, they were turning out to be key the establishment of new strategies of management farmacoeconomic of this type of based therapies in clinical results and with a multidisciplinary participation of all the professionals of the health involved in the managing of this therapy.</dc:description>
