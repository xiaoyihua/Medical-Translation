<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective was to measure gastrin (G) levels in maternal and neonatal sera as well as in amniotic fluid in patients with fetal distress and a control group. Twenty-five patients with term pregnancies were assigned to the following two groups: fifteen with acute fetal distress and ten with previous cesarean section. Maternal and neonatal blood and amniotic fluid samples were taken at the time of delivery. Differences between groups were calculated with non-parametric Mann Whitneys' U test. A significant difference (p &lt; 0.001) between G levels in amniotic fluid of fetal distress and those of the control group was found. In conclusion, serum G levels can be used as another predictor of fetal distress, although further studies must be performed before it can be used as a clinical tool.</dc:description>
