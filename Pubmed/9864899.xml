<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective is to determine the blood lead levels of the children (7-8 years of age) living in some of Madrid's satellite towns, and to establish links between these levels and different socioeconomic items, life styles and environmental factors, among other variables. A cross-sectional study using a sample based on 205 schoolchildren of Second Grade Primary Education, was under taken during 1995. Venous blood samples were analysed through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Parents answered a questionnaire with items used in this study. The average blood lead level found was 3.9 mud/dl (CI 95% 3.7-4.1), with higher levels among the children of the Northern zone of Madrid. Between the associated factors to blood lead level was found to be the habit of nail biting, mother's studies and some variables associated with habitual dwelling. We reached the conclusion that the blood lead levels of Madrid's suburban children are low.</dc:description>
