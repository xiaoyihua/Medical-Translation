<dc:description xml:lang="en">Previous studies have demonstrated an elevation in GH in adult insulin-dependent diabetics which can be modified by administration of pirenzepina either IV or orally. In this study we have evaluated the mean nocturnal GH levels (MNGH) and HbA1-C levels in a group of young insulin-dependent diabetics, both before and after treatment with pirenzepina (Gastrozepin). The study population included 8 patients, 6 males and 2 females, between the ages of 12 and 17 years, with a mean of 15.6 years. Pirenzepina was administered during one month at a nightly oral dose of 0.6 mg/kg followed by 5 months of treatment with 1 mg/kg. The most important results obtained in the study are the following: 1) Nocturnal administration of pirenzepina did not significantly modify the MNGH in the study population (10.88 +/- 3.81 ng/ml vs 9.57 +/- 8.25 ng/ml, p &gt; 0.05). 2) This pharmaceutical did not alter the plasma levels of HbA1-C (9.57 +/- 8.25 vs 10.01 +/- 2.30, p &gt; 0.05). However, 5 out of 8 patients had a decrease in their nocturnal GH secretion after pirenzepina treatment. If only the 5 patients that responded to this treatment are considered, the differences in MNGH are significant (10.48 +/- 4.94 before treatment vs 4.35 +/- 2.53 following treatment, p &lt; 0.05). Therefore, we conclude that oral pirenzepina treatment for 6 months, at the doses described, do not consistently decrease GH secretion in young diabetics nor does it decrease HbA1-C values in this group. However, further studies are necessary to establish the possible value of this treatment.</dc:description>
