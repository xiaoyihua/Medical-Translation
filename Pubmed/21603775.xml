<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Assessing the Brazilian clinical practice in patients with acute coronary syndrome, in public and private hospitals to identify gaps in the incorporation of clinical interventions with proven benefit. OBJECTIVE To develop a registry of patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome to assess demographics, morbidity, mortality, and standard practice in the care of this condition. Besides, to assess the prescription of evidence-based interventions such as aspirin, statins, beta blockers and reperfusion, among others. METHODS Registry-type prospective observational study intended to document hospital clinical practices of acute coronary syndrome in public and private hospitals in Brazil. In addition, longitudinal follow-up will be held until discharge and measurement of mortality and occurrence of serious events at 30 days, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS The findings will be presented one year after the start of collection (September 2011), and consolidated after a meeting with the population to discuss the objectives sought. CONCLUSION The analysis of this multicenter registry will design a horizontal perspective for the treatment of patients suffering from cardiovascular disease in Brazil.</dc:description>
