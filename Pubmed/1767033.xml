<dc:description xml:lang="en">A study was made of twelve cases with uveitis, glaucoma and hyphema (UGH) caused by rigid intraocular posterior chamber implants. Three of these patients were female and nine were males. The syndrome started in 75% of the cases two years after having been operated. The patients were followed for an average time of 42 months. Four patients responded to medical treatment. Eight patients required surgery. This syndrome is caused by the irritation and escoriation of the ciliary body at the inferior point which supports the hard lens. Serious complications arise from the removal of the lens. The author obtained good results in treating these patients with selective diathermy of the ciliary body under a scleral flap.</dc:description>
