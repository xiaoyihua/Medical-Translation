<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the outcome of lung transplantation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Spain. METHODS In all COPD patients transplanted at four Spanish hospitals over a period of seven years, we studied actuarial survival rates retrospectively using the Kaplan Meier test in relation to demographic characteristics, type of transplant, underlying disease, lung function evolution in terms of forced vital capacity (FVC), maximum expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1) and gasometric evolution (PaO2 and PaCO2). RESULTS Seventy-four transplants were performed in COPD patients over a five-year period. Mean age was 47 +/- 7 years (26-61) and 77% of the patients were men. A diagnosis of emphysema was made in 58%, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency emphysema in 14% and chronic bronchitis in 28%. The likelihood of survival was 75% for the first year, 63% for two years and 41% for the third year. Lung function and blood gases improved significantly by the third month after transplantation: FVC was 1677 +/- 637 ml before transplantation and 2631 +/- 670 ml afterwards; FEV1 was 585 +/- 189 ml before transplantation and 2118 +/- 673 ml afterwards (p &lt; 0.001). Double lung transplants achieved significantly greater improvement in function variables than did single-lung transplants (FVC 2843 +/- 681 ml and FEV1 2543 +/- 620 ml by the third month in DLT patients versus FVC 2402 +/- 587 ml and FEV1 1659 +/- 350 ml for SLT), with no significant differences in blood gases after the two types of transplant. Half the sing-lung transplant patients developed hyperinflation of the native lung and reached maximum lung function values, which tended to be lower than those for patients who did not experience this complication (FEV1 1638 +/- 349 ml versus 1930 +/- 307 ml, p = 0.051). CONCLUSIONS First-year mortality in patients with COPD undergoing lung transplantation in Spain is similar to that described in the International Transplant Registry. We found no differences between double- and single-lung transplant patients. Functional change is good for both types of transplantation, although this aspect of outcome is significantly better when two lungs are transplanted.</dc:description>
