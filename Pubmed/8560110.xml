<dc:description xml:lang="en">One thousand women hospitalized at a maternity were surveyed after their delivery or abortion about their first sexual intercourse and pregnancy. Mean age at the first sexual intercourse was 18.7 years and only 9.2% used a contraceptive method in spite that 20% were not willing to become pregnant. The mean age of sexual partners was 22 years old. Women of less than 32 years old generally had older sexual partners, but among those older than 25 years old the proportion of younger partners increased. The first pregnancy occurred at 20 years old as a mean, 62% of women were single, only 1.3% used a contraceptive method, and 27.3% of resultant pregnancies were not desired.</dc:description>
