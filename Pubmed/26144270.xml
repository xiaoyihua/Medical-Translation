<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Hepatic angiosarcoma is a rare vascular malignancy that accounts for 2% of all hepatic primary tumours. The diagnosis is difficult, especially if the patient does not have history of exposure to carcinogens, which are considered as risk factors. The diagnosis is made by histopathology, but in a considerable percentage it can only be accomplished by autopsy. The performing of fine needle aspiration biopsy can lead to bleeding, with limitations in its use. CLINICAL CASE A 41 year-old male, with no history of exposure to carcinogens, who developed abdominal pain secondary to a haemoperitoneum due to tumour rupture, was diagnosed by imaging methods with a giant cavernous hepatic haemangioma. He was initially treated with embolisation, and later with a liver transplant. After six months he developed haemoptysis secondary to lung metastasis. The autopsy reported metastatic hepatic angiosarcoma. DISCUSSION This condition has been related to carcinogen exposure, with malignant transformation from a benign vascular neoplasia being proposed as a hypothesis. The differential diagnosis can be achieved with imaging studies such as CT scan, and the definitive diagnosis is made by histopathology with immunohistochemistry tests, with 35%-100% being made in the autopsy. CONCLUSION Hepatic angiosarcoma is a malignant vascular neoplasia, the potential curative option is surgery with tumour free margins. Liver transplantation remains controversial because of its poor prognosis in the short term.</dc:description>
