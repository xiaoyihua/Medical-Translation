<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To study the factors that influence the non prescription of beta-blockers in patients discharged with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHOD A retrospective study was done of all patients discharged from our Service in the year 1998, with a diagnosis of AMI. The variables considered were age, sex, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, left ventricle dysfunction and COPD. RESULTS 60 patients with AMI were included in the study, 18 of whom (30%) were discharged without beta-blockers. The average age of these patients was 77 years, while the average age of those discharged with these pharmaceutical agents was 60 years (p &lt; 0.0001). Likewise, left ventricle dysfunction (p &lt; 0.031) and female gender (p &lt; 0.016), also negatively influenced the use of these drugs. It was observed with multivariable regression analysis that age was the main predictor for the use of beta-blockers (p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSION Age is the main factor that influences the non prescription of beta-blockers in patients with AMI in our Service. In spite of the potential adverse effects of the drugs in the advanced age population, the data so far obtained demonstrates a clear benefit in the subgroups at risk (advanced age, heart failure,...). Therefore it's use should be extended to this group of population as long as there are no absolute contraindications.</dc:description>
