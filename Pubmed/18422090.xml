<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To review the syncope in infants and adolescents as well as its etiology, clinical manifestations, physiopathology, diagnostic methods and treatment. DEVELOPMENT The syncope is a clinical entity characterized by sudden and transient loss of consciousness and postural tone, with a quick and complete recovery. The syncope is frequent in children and adolescents. The most common cause is neurocardiogenic (vasovagal), which has a benign evolution. Other causes may be neurological, cardiac and metabolic diseases, with a variable prognosis, which may come to be severe and potentially lethal. Evaluation of the syncope is mainly based on present clinical history, and on a detailed clinical examination. Basic complementary exams may help on the diagnosis, as a glycemia test, determination of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium), a hemogram and an electrocardiogram. The Tilt Test is "the" test to confirm the neurocardiogenic syncope. Treatment is indicated in syncopes with recurrent episodes or with risk of physical lesions. Prevention and education are indicated for all patients. Specific treatment should be individually given to each patient. In the case of neurocardiogenic syncope, beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic stimulants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and fludrocortisone are used. In the frequently recurrent neurocardiogenic syncope, when preventive actions are not enough or there is risk of lesions in consequence of falls, beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic stimulants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and fludrocortisone are used, as well as a pacemaker for severe cases non-responsive to pharmacological treatment. CONCLUSION The syncope is a frequent clinical entity in infancy and adolescence, with benign evolution but potentially lethal. Diagnosis and correct etiology are important for the implementation of specific and early treatment.</dc:description>
