<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To evaluate the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) or short-term alterations in glucose metabolism, obesity and vascular risk factors after birth in women with pregnancy metabolic syndrome (PMS). To evaluate the incidence of obesity, lipaemia, glucaemia disorder, blood pressure (BP), or lipid figures in the period after birth in children of women with PMS. DESIGN. Cohort study. SETTING. Forty two primary care centres. PARTICIPANTS Study cohort (SC): women with PMS and their children. Control cohort (CC): women without primary criteria of PMS and their children. SAMPLE SIZE SC, 980 women and CC, also 980. Consecutive sampling. MEASUREMENTS Mother: basic data, 75 g oral overload, lipid profile, insulinaemia, toxic habits, nutrition survey, and physical activity. Child: weight, height, BP, nutrition survey, glucaemia, insulinaemia, and lipid profile. Father: basic data, BP, glucaemia, lipid profile, insulinaemia, toxic habits, nutrition survey, and physical activity. We will study genes related to insulin resistance in all subjects. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Comparison of proportions with *2 test; ANOVA to measure means. Evaluation of effect of intra-uteral exposure through logistical regression and COX regression, whilst controlling potentially confusing and interactive variables. DISCUSSION This study will contribute to locating the moment when diabetes and vascular risk start and to finding the optimum moment for starting prevention strategies.</dc:description>
