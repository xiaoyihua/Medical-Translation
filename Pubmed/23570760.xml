<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objectives of this study were (a) to describe and estimate the frequency of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in rural and urban populations in two regions of Buenos Aires Province, and (b) to compare the presentation and distribution of factors hypothetically associated with HUS. A total of 82 HUS cases, recorded during the years 2005-2010 in rural and urban areas of the south-central region of Buenos Aires Province, were clinically and epidemiologically characterized. Statistical data analysis included Chi square or Fisher test and median test. The incidence rate of HUS was significantly higher in the rural population, being 12.7 cases per 100 000 (CI 0-23.5) in rural inhabitants vs. 7.1 cases per 100 000 (CI 0-9.5) in urban inhabitants. The median age of the patients was 27 months (5-139 months), significantly lower in children from the rural area. This could be explained by a more frequent contact with bovine feces, the consumption of raw milk and a higher proportion of relatives who work in risk labors found in the rural population. Although HUS is often associated with the consumption of undercooked minced meat, most of the children cases here included did not present this antecedent. Clinical manifestations were similar in both subpopulations. One-third of urban patients had received antibiotics prior to HUS development.</dc:description>
