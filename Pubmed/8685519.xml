<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Atherosclerosis originates during childhood and serum lipid levels are a key factor of the process. The aim of this study is to assess the evolution in the mean serum lipid levels found in children and teenagers in Navarra, Spain, in 1987 and 1993 and to compare them with the overall Spanish standard levels. METHODS Two cross-sectional surveys on cardiovascular risk factors in the population aged 4 to 17-years in the Navarra region, carried out in 1987 and 1993. Both studies used comparable procedures, and covered school-children between the above-mentioned ages of 4 and 17 years. The lipid levels were assayed by enzymatic methods from blood samples, using an autoanalyzer. Statistical methods to compare means and proportions were used. RESULTS The sample size was 5,829 in 1987 and 3,256 in 1993. Among males, the average cholesterolemia was 177.3 mg/dl in 1987 and 174 mg/dl in 1993. Among females it was 179.8 mg/dl in 1987 and 174.9 mg/dl in 1993. The percentage of males with cholesterolemia over 200 mg/dl was 20.4% in 1987 and 16.8% in 1993. Among females this percentage was 21.9% in 1987 and 17.8% in 1993. The percentage of males showing hyperlipidemia (LDL/HDL &gt; 2.2) was 15.1% in 1987 and 12.5% in 1993. For females this percentage went from 16.8% in 1987 to 13% in 1993. CONCLUSIONS Between 1987 and 1993 a decrease in the average levels of serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol among the infant-to-young population of Navarra has been assessed. No changes in the HDL or serum tryglicerides were detected. Some effects in the results, due to differences in the pre-analytical and analytical phases of both surveys, cannot be excluded.</dc:description>
