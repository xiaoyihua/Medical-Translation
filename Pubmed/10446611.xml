<dc:description xml:lang="en">Erectile dysfunction or impotence is a frequent disease which provokes an alteration in the well-being of those patients who suffer from it and consequently causes distortions, both in a private and a social context, leading to an alteration in the Gordon Health Standard. Our program is geared to all those patients to whom intracavernosum injections of vasoactivating drugs have been prescribed as alternate therapy to solve their erection problem by means of providing information, education, learning, training, control and follow-up in the development of this pathology as well as in its treatment.</dc:description>
