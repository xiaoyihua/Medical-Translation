<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. The absence of FMRP protein, codified by the FMR1 gene, results in fragile X phenotype. DNA-based diagnostic methods determine the length of the CGG repeat within the FMR1 gene, the main mutation causing the syndrome. Immunohistochemical diagnostic tests detect all mutations leading to the absence of FMRP expression. Results of the antibody test on hair roots correlate with intellectual quotient in affected men and women. PATIENTS AND METHODS Immunohistochemical techniques were used to study FMRP expression in hair roots in a control group to establish the correlation with the length of the CGG repeat. Subsequently, 65 girls and boys with mental retardation attending special schools were screened by using the FMRP test on hair roots. RESULTS Males and females molecularly characterized as within the normal and premutated range expressed FMRP in more than 70 % of hair roots. Full mutation carriers expressed FMRP in less than 70 % of hair roots. Immunohistochemical studies in males and females with mental retardation led to the identification of one affected male. CONCLUSIONS Fragile X syndrome detection by immunohistochemical testing of hair roots is a valid method of population screening because of the relative noninvasiveness of obtaining samples, and the ease and rapidness of the technique, which can be applied to routine clinical practice.</dc:description>
