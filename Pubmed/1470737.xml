<dc:description xml:lang="en">Percutaneous balloon dilatation of the mitral valve is a promising alternative to surgical treatment for patients with mitral stenosis. We analysed echocardiographic and haemodynamic results in 62 consecutive patients who underwent mitral dilatation with a big and one chamber balloon (30 mm diameter). The relationship between the dilatation balloon area and body surface was 4.2 (in 98% of patients it was bigger than 3.5). In the whole series we get significant improvements in the haemodynamic parameters and mitral areas (0.91 cm2 versus 1.78 cm2)(p &lt; 0.005). According to the echocardiographic score, patients were divided in two groups. Good results (mitral area &gt; 1.5 cm2, and final, valve area 50% greater than the initial area), were obtained in 93% of patients with a score of 8 or less, and in 45% of patients with a score bigger than 8. Seventy-five percent of patients with bad results (mitral area &lt; 1.5 cm2) were in atrial fibrillation versus 37% of patients where we get a good results. Mortality of procedure was nulle, and two patients required surgery because of procedure failure for mitral insufficiency. We can conclude: percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty with single balloon is valid alternative, and good results can be expected if there is a good relationship between the area of balloon and patient's body-surface. The echocardiographic score and presence of atrial fibrillation can predict immediate results of this technique.</dc:description>
