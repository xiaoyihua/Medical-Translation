<dc:description xml:lang="en">Rural hospitals have an increasing importance in pediatric hospital care as the organization of Public Health is becoming more rational in our country. There is little information about the possibilities for adequate care in rural hospitals. Statistics for admissions, occupancy, morbidity, etc. of two years experience are reported as a base line for guidance in the planning of this type of centers. From data reported, evidence is that neonatal pathology contributes with about one half of hospital admissions. On the other hand infectious diseases represent the largest single cause group of hospital admissions for infants and older children. Mortality is mainly due to that of premature infants with weights under 1.500 grams and low gestational age.</dc:description>
