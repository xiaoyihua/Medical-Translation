<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The economic impact caused by diseases goes far beyond health care costs and, therefore it is transferred to the society through different dimensions. The aim of this study was to estimate the productivity losses due to premature deaths caused by diseases occurred in Spain during the period 2005-2009. METHODS We used data from several sources (Death Registry, Labour Force Survey and Wage Structure Survey) to develop a simulation model based on the human-capital approach that allowed us to estimate the labour productivity losses caused by premature deaths in the period analysed. Additionally, we also carried out two alternative scenarios in which we analysed how epidemiologic data influenced our results. RESULTS Our model showed the estimated loss of productivity due to premature death fell from 8,935 billion euros in 2005 to 8,073 billion euros in 2009. Nine diseases (traffic accidents, malignant tumour of the trachea, suicides, acute myocardial infarction, AIDS, cirrhosis, breast tumour, cerebrovascular disease and colon cancer) accounted for 35.6% of the total Years of Potential Productive Life Lost and 36.5% of the estimated productivity losses. The estimated losses represented 0.98%, 0.85% and 0.77% of Gross Domestic Product in 2005, 2007 and 2009, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The labour productivity losses caused by premature deaths decreased substantially in the period analysed. This reduction was mainly due to the epidemiological evolution of premature mortality.</dc:description>
