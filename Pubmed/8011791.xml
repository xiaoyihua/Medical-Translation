<dc:description xml:lang="en">Highly saturated fat and cholesterol intakes elevate serum cholesterol levels, which is a risk factor for suffering from cardiovascular disease, one of the most important death causes in developed countries. Milk and dairy products, because of their high saturated fat and cholesterol levels, are often included among the forbidden foodstuffs for people with high serum cholesterol levels. But our studies demonstrate that dairy products, including the whole cream ones, don't increase total cholesterol but increase HDL-cholesterol levels. The intake of skimmed dairy products seem to have a preventive effect on the developing of atherosclerosis, because they condition decreases in serum cholesterol levels, specially in people with hyperlipemia. Dairy products are also effective for the control of triglyceridemia, hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors. When the dietitian introduces nutritional measurements to prevent or stop cardiovascular disease, it is important to know the nutritional status of the person, in order that the fight against cardiovascular disease does not lead to nutritional deficiencies with similar or worse sanitary repercussions than cardiovascular disease itself. Dairy products are excellent sources of proteins, vitamins and minerals. Their regular intake can prevent, whereas their restriction can lead to nutritional deficit and pathologies. The results of our study show that it is not advisable to limit the intake of dairy products, not even whole cream ones. Only if there is a pathology, as hypercholesterolemia, it can be beneficial to consume skimmed and semi-skimmed dairy products.</dc:description>
