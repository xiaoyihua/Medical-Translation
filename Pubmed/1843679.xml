<dc:description xml:lang="en">We studied 30 young patients with idiopathic chronic constipation through the ingestion and colonic follow-up of 20 radiopaque markers, gotten from catheters of those used for intravenous lines. The number of markers were counted in each segment and total colon. Mean segmental and total colonic transit times were also calculated. There was a greater number of markers in each segment and total colon compared to 20 control subjects (p &lt; 0.001). The mean colonic transit time was 61.4 hours (patients and 15.6 hours controls) (p &lt; 0.001) occurring an important delay in the left colon and rectosigmoid (45.72 hours). So, in these patients there was predominantly a left colon dysfunction and the called outlet obstruction syndrome, likely related to their evacuatory habits. We do recommend this method as a valuable diagnostic tool for particularly observing the colonic progression and to offer a more rational assessment to the chronic constipated patient.</dc:description>
