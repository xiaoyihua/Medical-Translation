<dc:description xml:lang="en">Polycystic kidney disease is a common genetic cause of chronic kidney disease, characterized by the formation of multiple cysts in the kidneys and other organs, occurs in 1 in 20,000 live births. 30 to 50% of affected newborns die shortly after birth because of respiratory and renal insufficiency. This study reports the case of a newborn with polycystic kidney disease diagnosed by obstetric ultrasound at 26 weeks of gestation and kidneys anhidramnios due to increased volume and appearance "in sponge." Neonato a primigravida 19 years of age. At 26 weeks you will be detected in a routine obstetric evaluation that measures were in line for somatométricas fetal gestational age, and anhidramnios increase in renal mass and bilateral thorax narrow. The pregnancy ended in a cesarean section at 37 weeks with a newborn of 3140 g, women who died within minutes after birth. We requested an autopsy because of the need for genetic counseling. The findings were: enlarged kidneys with microcystic dilatation of collecting duct and in the renal cortex and medulla, liver fibrosis and Müllerian duplication with double uterine cavity. It is a rare association between polycystic kidney disease and Müllerian duplication, liver fibrosis confirmed by autopsy and has not been documented previously.</dc:description>
