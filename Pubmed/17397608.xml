<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The Intensive Care Unit (UCI) environment is not the most appropriate for the development of the end-of-life process, due to the fact that ICU is a hi-tech setting and its focus is on curing and giving life support, rather than delivering palliative care to patients. AIMS To investigate supportive behaviours and obstacles, and the nurses' demographic characteristics. METHOD A descriptive correlational design was used in five tertiary Spanish hospitals. A convenience sample included 151 critical care nurses. A self-administered anonymous questionnaire (Beckstrand and Kirchhoff, 2005) was used to investigate supportive behaviours and obstacles perceived by nurses providing end-of-life care, in a scale from 0 to 5 (O = not help/obstacle; 5 = main help/obstacle). Some demographic data of the sample were also collected. FINDINGS Nurses mean age was 35 (min. 22-max. 57; SD = 7,6) and had an average of 9,2 (min. 1-max. 30; SD = 6,9) years of experience working in ICU. Physicians agreeing on direction of patient care was perceived as the most supportive item (x = 4.46); whereas ethics committee constantly involved in the unit as the least supportive one (x = 2.93). The main obstacle for nurses was patient having pain that is difficult to control or alleviate (x = 4.38), and nurses knowing poor prognosis before family was seen as the less important obstacle (x = 1.37) Statistically significant correlations were found between nurses age and years of experience in ICU and their perception of some helps/obstacles. Statistically significant differences were found between nurses with postgraduate education in intensive care and those without it and their perception of some helps/obstacles. CONCLUSIONS Intensive care nurses perceive adequate patients' pain management, agreement between health professionals on decision-making, and facilitating a comfortable environment for patients and families, during the whole end-of-life process as a priority.</dc:description>
