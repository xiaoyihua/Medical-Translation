<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Preliminary data suggest some beneficial effects of botulinum toxin type A (BT-A) on primary headaches. OBJECTIVE To analyze the subjective influence of BT-A on previous primary headaches of those patients receiving this treatment due to a variety of cranio-cervical dystonia (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS All patients receiving BT-A due to CD were interviewed with an ad hoc questionnaire on the presence or not of headaches prior to BT treatment. Diagnosis and subjective effects of BT-A on these previous headaches were recorded. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients (28 women) were interviewed; 21 (19 women) reported a history of previous primary headache (12 migraine, 10 tension-type headache). Nine (41 %) reported sustained response ( &gt; 50 % reduction in headache frequency) since the beginning of BT-A treatment. Patients with cervical dystonia or those receiving high doses ( &gt; 50 U) showed the best responses. Age, gender, pain location, duration of BT-A treatment and headache diagnosis did not seem to correlate with response. CONCLUSIONS BT-A seems to have sustained beneficial effect on primary headaches of some patients with CD, especially at doses higher than 50 U and in patients with the diagnosis of spasmodic torticollis.</dc:description>
