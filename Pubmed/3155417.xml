<dc:description xml:lang="en">We studied the adsorption of sodium fluoride, ammonium fluoride, tin fluoride and sodium monofluorophosphate to synthetic hydroxiapatite in function of the pH (pH 4.7, 5.5 and 6.1). In two models; in a first model was eluted the fluorides of the hydroxiapatite column with artificial saliva; in the second model were incubated the fluoride with bufferized hydroxiapatite to the above pH. The fluoride determination was done by potentiometric method with a specific ion activity electrode. The results in the elution indicated that the sodium and tin fluorides give elution levels different at the pH studied. By other hand ammonium fluoride did not present differences. The results with incubation demonstrated that ammonium fluoride gives the greater adsorption, the sodium fluoride is slightly lower, and the sodium monofluorophosphate the lowest. Also, was observed that the adsorption decrease with the increase of the pH for the three fluorides. The comparison of both models showed that the incubation presented higher values of adsorption than the elution for the pH studied.</dc:description>
