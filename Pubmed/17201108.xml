<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The present study was done at the internal medicine service oft he Hospital lnfantil in the State of Sonora, Mexico. We tried to address the question of the use of conceptual schemes and mind maps and its impact on the teaching-learning-evaluation process among medical residents. OBJECTIVE Analyze the effects of conceptual schemes, and mind maps as a teaching and evaluation tool and compare them with multiple choice exams among Pediatric residents. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty two residents (RI, RII, RIII)on service rotation during six months were assessed initially, followed by a lecture on a medical subject. Conceptual schemes and mind maps were then introduced as a teaching-learning-evaluation instrument. Comprehension impact and comparison with a standard multiple choice evaluation was done. The statistical package (JMP version 5, SAS inst. 2004) was used. RESULTS We noted that when we used conceptual schemes and mind mapping, learning improvement was noticeable among the three groups of residents (P &lt; 0.001) and constitutes a better evaluation tool when compared with multiple choice exams (P &lt; 0.0005). CONCLUSION Based on our experience we recommend the use of this educational technique for medical residents in training.</dc:description>
