<dc:description xml:lang="en">Leptospirosis is an acute generalized infectious disease caused by a spirochete of the genus Leptospira. Humans become infected by direct contact with the animal reservoir or indirectly through standing water or contaminated wet areas; once the leptospira has entered the body through the mucosa or eroded skin, it is spread by blood circulation. It can cause hepatic, renal and muscular disorders, as well as meningeal inflammation. We report the case of a patient admitted to the ICU for an infectious process produced by leptospira. Complications are described and identified as nursing problems and/or diagnoses. Following the NANDA nomenclature, the diagnoses were: Tissue-perfusion disturbance. Deterioration of gas exchange. Deterioration of verbal communication. Nutritional disorder. These categories enabled specific nursing interventions to be planned for the patient's care. The patient died of multiple organ failure in spite of conventional care and treatment.</dc:description>
