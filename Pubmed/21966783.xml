<dc:description xml:lang="en">The arrenoblastome is an ovary tumor with masculine hormone production, testosterone and other hormones. Other names are: stromatic tumor or gonadal stromatic tumor, also steroid cell tumor. They are rare tumors; represent 0.5% of all ovary tumors. It could be present in all age women groups, more frequently in young people. Most of times unilateral (95%), solids or quistic-solids. Anaplastic grade give them a malignity disease in 5 to 10 % cases. We report the case of a 35 year-old woman with clinical appearance of androgenism for ovary tumor, she was accepted for surgery, founded 7 liters of ascitis, produced for an ovary tumor, integral capsule, it produced masculine hormones. Histological study reported ovarian sex cord tumor, high grade, 30 cm size, integral capsule, all normally. Stage IC. Size and differential cellular grade need systemic chemotherapy. At the time of this report her tumoral marks are normal, and she has gradual diminution of virilizing characters produced for ovary tumor. Prognosis of the disease depends the grade of cell differentiation and stage in surgical-pathological events. Survival to five years stage I is approximate in 70 to 90% of the cases. Angular stone treatment is surgery. Disseminate cases, chemotherapy or radiotherapy most be considerate. Usually arrenoblastome has poor possibilities of dissemination and considering the early detection the histological grade of healthy is very high.</dc:description>
