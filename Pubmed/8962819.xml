<dc:description xml:lang="en">Changes in bladder behaviour and neurological symptoms were evaluated in 47 patients underwent untethered spinal cord because of tethered cord syndrome secondary to myeloneningocele closure. Patients were located in 3 categories (A &lt; or = 5 years, B = 6-10 years and C &gt; 10 years) in relation to age of treatment. After untethering 77% improved neurologically and the best results were evident in children whose condition was repaired promptly (90%). Urodynamic studies were performed in 33 patients before and after surgery. Fifteen had hyperreflexic bladders, six low complicance and 12 hyperreflexia plus low compliance. After treatment in 6 patients bladder dysfunction improved (18%), hyperreflexia disappeared in 4 and sphinteric resistance increased in 2. In patients with tethered cord syndrome, untethering is recommended treatment in preventing further, sometimes rapid neurologic dysfunction and better results are got in childs whose condition is repaired at an early ages.</dc:description>
