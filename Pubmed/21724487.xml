<dc:description xml:lang="en">Benign and malignant bile duct strictures require multidisciplinary management. The radiologist, endoscopist and surgeon must assess the general conditions of the patient, as well as the etiology of the stenosis and the therapeutic options (palliative, temporal, or definitive). Stenotic injuries that maintain bilioenteric continuity are susceptible to radiologic and/or endoscopic treatment, specially benign lesions, usually appearing in the postsurgical period. Injuries with loss of continuity require surgical management in almost every case. Iatrogenic bile duct injuries with preserved continuity (Strasberg A and D) may be treated by endoscopy. Types B and C, in which a liver segment loses communication with the remaining bile tree, need surgical repair and/or resection. Complete sections of the bile ducts require surgical intervention, with hepatojejunostomy being the best choice. The use of metallic endoluminal stents is almost prohibited in these types of injuries. Benign, non-iatrogenic injuries (sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune cholangiopathy) require surgical intervention in rare occasions. Malignant injuries are extremely aggressive and only a small percentage (less than 15%) is candidate for curative resection, which unfortunately does not preclude recurrence.</dc:description>
