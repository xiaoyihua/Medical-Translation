<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Molecular biology is a new branch of biological sciences, with novel laboratory techniques that are being progressively applied into biomedical and clinical research and, furthermore, into medical practice. AIMS To evaluate the use of molecular biology techniques in Chilean biomedical and clinical research and its evolution in the recent decade. METHODS All papers published as research articles, clinical experiences or case reports, in Revista Médica de Chile, during two time periods: 1987-1989 and 1997-1999, were reviewed to find out whether molecular biology techniques had been used or not. This journal publishes roughly 40% of papers generated in Chile, in biomedical or clinical topics, while another 15% appears in foreign journals. RESULTS Among 341 papers published in 1987-1989, 57 (16.7%) had used one or more molecular biology techniques; in contrast, among 318 papers published in 1997-1999, 91 (28.8%) had used them (p &lt; 0.001). Most papers using molecular biology techniques were research articles. Immunology, genetics, endocrinology, hematology, hepatology and rheumatology were the specialties providing a greater number and proportion of papers using molecular biology techniques. Chilean universities were the main institutions sponsoring these articles and FONDECYT (the Chilean Government Research Granting Office) was the main source of funding. The University of Chile (State-owned) provided most centers where these publications had been generated, followed by the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. CONCLUSIONS Molecular biology techniques have been rapidly and progressively incorporated as research tools in biomedicine and clinical medicine, in Chile. At the present time, these techniques are predominantly used in research conducted in University settings and funded by Governmental research grants.</dc:description>
