<dc:description xml:lang="en">Even though many massage techniques are called chiromassage, this term must be used to describe a technique created by its inventor, Dr. Ferrándiz, who based on knowledge from German, Swiss and Oriental techniques, developed his own technique and in order to differentiate it from other techniques, gave it the name chiro-meaning hand-massage; which is to say massage using hands, without the use of any apparatus. Once this clarification has been made, the author analyzes the parts which compose a good chiromassage: 1) preparatory exercises: exploration, initial contact, magnetic sedative passes, etc. 2) kneading: in order to distort and elongate muscle fibers, 3) specific exercises: distinct one for each individual case, and 4) finalizing exercises: vibrations, drumming with one's fingers, venal drainage and magnetic sedative passes.</dc:description>
