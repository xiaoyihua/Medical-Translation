<dc:description xml:lang="en">The influence of risk factors predisposing to recurrences was assessed in 103 children with febrile convulsions who were given prophylactic treatment with phenobarbitone, primidone or sodium valproate at adequate doses and whose compliance with treatment was monitored. There was a greater risk of recurrence among girls. Increasing risk was observed with decreasing age at which children suffered the first febrile convulsion. Neither a family history of epilepsy, failure of previous treatment, history of perinatal incidents, focal or prolonged febrile convulsions, recognition of neurological disease nor the number of previous febrile convulsions led to any significantly greater risk in these children. There was an increased tendency for recurrence with increasing interval between the first febrile convulsion and the start of prophylactic treatment.</dc:description>
