<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse the repercussion of the disease in social and occupational status of multiple sclerosis patients. To describe the frequency with these patients are faced to architectural barriers in their own home. PATIENTS AND METHODS We addressed a postal survey to 250 patients previously evaluated in our multiple sclerosis unit. Clinical data were recorded in the EDMUS database. RESULTS A hundred and sixty patients answered the questionnaire. Mean age was 39.2 +/- 11.9 years. Mean duration of the disease was 10.05 +/- 8.4 years. Twenty-one per cent of patients were in progressive phase of the disease. Eighty-nine patients (55.6%) were unemployed. Unemployed patients had arrived to a moderate disability level (EIS &gt; or = 3) before than employed patients. Only 17% of patients older than 50 years were employed vs. 63% of those among 26-35 years. Only EIS and years of school attendance were independently related to the unemployment status. Forty per cent of patients referred household income greater to $8,000/year. Thirty-six per cent of patients with severe disability (EIS &gt; 6) was living in a floor with stairs and without lift. Forty-four per cent of patients with EIS &gt; 6 had architectural barriers in their bathroom. CONCLUSIONS More than half of multiple sclerosis patients were unemployed. Only the degree of disability and educational level were related in a independent way with unemployment status. Many patients unable to walking unaided had architectural barriers at home.</dc:description>
