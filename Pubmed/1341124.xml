<dc:description xml:lang="en">Owing to its sinister characteristics, as well as its temporal pertaining to the Modern Age, the Witch-Hunt historical episode has become an embarrassing affair for our supposedly rational beings' self-esteem. Long lastingly, therefore, Witch-Hunt has been either overpassed straight away or just attributed to violent and pathological a manifestation of collective craze as its own name indicates. Lately, though, many authors have met the challenge of finding out a rational background thereof, actually unearthing coldly calculated, relentlessly pursued outweighing political and economic interests. It is the author's contention that a serene, diligent consideration of all hypotheses that have been set before the connection with this episode--together with their very inherent disparities--could (apart from their own heuristic values) contribute eventually to both sharpening and broadening the understanding of our human condition, complex and fragile as it is.</dc:description>
