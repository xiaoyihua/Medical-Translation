<dc:description xml:lang="en">We show the results obtained with 318 patients who had a Hancock prosthesis implanted in mitral and/or aortic positions, between June of 1974 and December of 1976. The maximal follow-up period (January 1980) was of 5.58 years, with a total follow-up of 1,129.8 patient years. The hospital rate of mortality was 10.3% (33/318), with 19 late deaths, which gives a linear index of late mortality for mitral, aortic, and mitro-aortic patients of 1.18%, 1.40%, and 3.82% patient-year respectively. The actuarial analysis of the results show a survival rate at 67 months of 89.5% for the aortics, 85% for the mitrals, and 70% for the mitro-aortics. In 12 occasions prosthesis complications developed (7 ruptures, 3 thrombosis, and 2 prosthesic disfunctions), which represents an incidence of 0.28%, 0.84%, and 2.72% patient-years for the aortic, mitral, and mitro-aortic patients respectively. Of the 15 thromboembolic accidents that developed, none had a fatal outcome, and their incidence for the aortic, mitral, and mitro-aortic patients was 0.28%, 2.19%, and 5.46% patient-year respectively. The actuarial analysis of thromboembolism shows that 98.9%, 98.3%, and 91,3% of aortic, mitro-aortic, and mitral patients respectively, were free of thromboembolism at 67 months postoperatively. The 99.3% of the patients that survived surgery have improved functionally, 80.4% having no symptoms from the cardiovascular point of view.</dc:description>
