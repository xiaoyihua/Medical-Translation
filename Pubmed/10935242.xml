<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The neurological features of chronic renal failure are very varied. Uremic myopathy is a controversial condition. In most cases it is related to the secondary hyperparathyroidism which these patients develop, and its characteristics are superimposed on their osteomalacia myopathy. CLINICAL CASES AND CONCLUSIONS We report two patients with terminal chronic renal failure on hemodialysis who complained on difficulty with walking. The clinical findings, laboratory and neurophysiological investigations and the histopathological report of the muscle biopsy were similar to those of osteomalacia myopathy. The muscle weakness of patients with terminal chronic renal failure is related to many factors. The most important of these is the secondary hyperparathyroidism which leads to osteomalacia myopathy. On muscle biopsy there was isolated fibre necrosis of both types 1 and 2 (case 1) and of type 2 alone (case 2), which is considered to be the commonest finding. Although treatment with high doses of vitamin D3, or its hydroxylated metabolites, has been recommended, it was not effective in our patients.</dc:description>
