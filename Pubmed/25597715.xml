<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Describe the availability of psychotropic medications for the treatment of mental disorders in the health care facilities of the Ministry of Health of Peru. MATERIALS AND METHODS Monthly inventory reports of the availability and consumption of medications in facilities of the Ministry of Health during 2011 were analyzed. Using a cross sectional design, the availability of seven classes of psychotropic medications was determined. Also, the level of care of the establishments and the level of decisional autonomy to purchase medications were determined. RESULTS Anti-anxiety medications were available in health facilities of all levels of care. Antidepressants and antipsychotics were available in about two thirds of hospitals and in less than 20% of health centers and small health clinics. The other four classes of psychotropic medications (lithium, hypnotics and sedatives, psychostimulants/ADHD, and anti-dementia drugs) were only available in hospitals and not in health centers and small health clinics. 5% of hospitals had a sufficient supply to meet the demand for the year. CONCLUSIONS There is a significant gap in the availability of psychotropic medications in the health care facilities of the Ministry of Health of Peru. This was observed both in hospitals and in primary care facilities. Actions are needed in health policy and management, including more funding and greater mental health training for staff in primary care, among other initiatives.</dc:description>
