<dc:description xml:lang="en">A radiological method to determine the ideal, geometrical, center of the acetabulum and femoral head is described by the author; the proceedings for these localizations and the interrelationship between them, are also described. These factors were taken from a series of simple radiography and arthograms, which is called; "Concentrical Centring" in normal hips, as well as other seires of dislocated hips, which were radiographed in anteroopsterior view, and in frog position, as well as in histological sections. The necessity to look for the concentrical reduction of the dislocated hips is also emphasized, as a basic point for the good development of the acetabulum, which is achieved, at the time of treatment, if the location is made of the point of the femoral head with that of the acetabulum (Concentrical Reduction). This method will permit to evaluate this interrelationship easily in a numerical scale figure and with a minimum of error. This is a useful resource previous to the arthrography in those hips which have been just recently reduced; and latter, in their follow-up.</dc:description>
