<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The objective of this work has been to know if to all patients with diagnostic suspected of acute pulmonary embolism and pathologic perfusion scanning, ventilation scintigraphy were performed in the assistance context, analyzing etiopathogenic, clinic and diagnostic factors related with the non prescription of the ventilation scintigraphic study. METHODS In 1992 we have carried out a retrospective and random study of 50 patients with perfusion scintigraphy for diagnostic suspected of acute pulmonary embolism (APE). RESULTS A diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis was made respectively in 35 (70%) and 22 (44%) of a total of 50 patients. In twenty patients ventilation scintigraphic study were not performed, six of them with normal perfusion scanning and fourteen patients with pathologic scintigraphic perfusion and acute pulmonary embolism diagnosis (78.5% with high probability scintigraphic scans). In this work we find a total of 14 patients with perfusion scanning without ventilation study. The presence of high probability scintigraphic scans or the acute pulmonary embolism were significant statistically related with the non prescription of the ventilation study. CONCLUSIONS In our opinion, none of these factors can explain the non realization of the ventilation scanning, considering this study indispensable before the presence of patient with scintigraphic perfusion defects and suspected of pulmonary embolus.</dc:description>
