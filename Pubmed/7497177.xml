<dc:description xml:lang="en">We performed a retrospective study with 26 patients with partial epilepsy (16 male, 10 female), aged between 1 and 24 months. We excluded those patients with seizures secondary to cerebral and extracerebral acute diseases, febrile convulsions, infantile spasms and other epileptic syndromes frequently diagnosed at this age. Etiology was of prenatal origin in 8 cases, perinatal in 9, postnatal in 3, and 6 were cryptogenic. They were all initially treated with phenobarbital (PB), 5 mg/kg/day. If seizures did not disappear, clonazepam (CZP) 0.1 mg/kg/day was added. Fifteen patients were controlled with PB in monotherapy, 7 need the association of CZP, and 4 patients could not be controlled. Among the last ones, 2 were controlled with PB and phenytoin, and the other 2 showed no response to any other drugs. Side effects (drowsiness and increased oropharyngeal secretions) were mild and transient. According to our experience, PB, alone or associate with CZP, is a safe and efficient treatment for seizures in symptomatic and cryptogenic partial epilepsy.</dc:description>
