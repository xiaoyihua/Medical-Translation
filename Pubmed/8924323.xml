<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To study a possible correlation between the urea breath test values prior to treatment and the response to Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy in patients with duodenal ulcer. METHODS Seventy-seven patients with duodenal ulcer were retrospectively studied (mean age: 46 +/- 13 years; 71% males). Initially, an endoscopy with biopsy samples (H&amp;E stain) taken from antrum and body was performed, and a 13C-urea breath test (measuring 13C difference: delta 13CO2) was also performed. Both procedures were repeated one month after completing therapy ("classic" triple therapy [n = 25], and omeprazole plus amoxycillin [n = 52]). RESULTS Eradication was achieved in 40% of cases (n = 32), and it was higher in patients treated with "classic" triple therapy (60%) than in those treated with omeprazole plus amoxycillin (31%) (p = 0.017). Mean delta 13CO2 level was 25 +/- 15. There were no differences when comparing values of patients with successful eradication (24 +/- 18) or therapy failure (25.6 +/- 13). No differences were observed when considering both therapies separately or when comparing eradication rates depending upon breath test levels prior to therapy. Breath test values did not influence the eradication in the logistic regression model. Mean delta 13CO2 values after therapy in patients with eradication failure ran in parallel with those observed previously. CONCLUSION No correlation was observed between urea breath test values before treatment and the response to H. pylori eradication therapy in patients with duodenal ulcer. Thus, we conclude that quantification of this diagnostic method is not useful to predict the success or failure of eradicating therapy.</dc:description>
