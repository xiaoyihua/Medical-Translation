<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze published evidence about adalimumab use in autoimmune diseases. METHODS Systematic review of MEDLINE database of citations included from January 1990 to December 2008 employing the terms "adalimumab" and the different systemic autoimmune diseases. RESULTS Our search identified 241 potentially relevant citations. 154 were retrieved for detailed evaluation. Finally, 18 were selected as relevant, including 54 patients. The reported diseases were as follow: Behçet disease in 16 patients, idiopathic uveitis in 13, sarcoidosis in 5, uveitis associated with rheumatologic diseases in 5 (psoriasis in 2, ankylosing spondylitis in 1, juvenile idiopathic arthritis in 1, Crohn disease in 1), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease in 4, Birdshot uveitis in 4, vasculitis in 3 (1 temporal arteritis, 1 Takayasu's disease, 1 skin vasculitis associated with rheumatoid arthritis), adult onset Still disease in 2, relapsing polychondritis in 1 and systemic sclerosis in 1. The clinical spectrum included uveitis (39 cases), skin and/or mucosae (9), vasculitis (3), arthritis (6), lung (3). These patients were refractory to standard therapy, including corticosteroids (42 cases, 78%), immunosuppressants (42, 78%) and biologics (29, 54%). Fifty (93%) patients responded to adalimumab. The clinical response was similar in those patients who had been treated with other biologic and in those who had not received biologic therapy before adalimumab. The patients were followed for 11.9 months. Twelve (22%) patients relapsed. Five (9%) patients suffer some side effect (3 local skin reaction, 1 angioedema, 1 lung fibrosis). One patient (2%) died due to progression of her disease. CONCLUSIONS Available data about the use of adalimumab in autoinmune diseases come from case reports and uncontrolled studies, that include patients with severe disease and refractory to standard therapy. In this setting, it seems to be an effective and safe treatment option, especially in patients with uveitis and Behçet's disease. This initial data must be confirmed by controlled assays before extending adalimumab use.</dc:description>
