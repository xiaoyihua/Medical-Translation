<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Between December 1999 and December 2004 the footwear manufacturing industry in Elche suffered a 24% fall in employment. In this context, it was decided to conduct study to detect possible changes in the demand for mental health care. MATERIAL AND METHODS The first-time consultations between December 2001 and June 2002 were compared with those seen between October 2004 and April 2005. Differences were looked for in the percentage of referrals for work-related stress factors. The role of these work-related stress factors in the changes detected in the sociodemographic profile of the patients was also evaluated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Changes were detected in the sociodemographic profile (gender and education level), employment status and reason for consultation. First consultations increased in the following groups: males, with a higher education level, unemployed, on sick leave or pensioners, and also those with employment problems as the main reason for consultation or a worsening of other health conditions.</dc:description>
