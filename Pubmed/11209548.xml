<dc:description xml:lang="en">The author exposes the present concept of metabolic syndrome X, which is a complex of Type II diabetes, obesity, hypertension and vascular problems. This syndrome has been known for many years, but it has been individualized as such only recently. This is due to the huge importance that obesity is reaching in developed countries, especially in the U.S.A. Today this is a very important health problem. In this work, in addition to the description of the syndrome, which is purely an internal medicine issue, its relation to some women-specific problems is also explained, especially to the so-called polycystic ovary.</dc:description>
