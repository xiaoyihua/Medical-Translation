<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this work is to describe the health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and to analyze the associated factors to overweight/obesity in a representative sample of the Catalan population 0-14 years old. Proxyrespondents answered the child's questionnaire of the Encuesta de Salud de Cataluna (ESCA) 2006 (n = 2.200). Variables analyzed were weight and height, the KIDSCREEN-10 HRQOL questionnaire, and also scales on risky behaviors, physical activity, frequency of fast food consumption, and number of hours of television viewing. Logistic regression models were adjusted. In 31% of children HRQOL was excellent/very good. Risky behaviors and restriction of activity were the associated factors to the best and the worst HRQOL. Maternal level of education and some habits and behaviors were associated to overweight/obesity. The ESCA contributes with useful information to monitor and to assess interventions addressed to the children population.</dc:description>
