<dc:description xml:lang="en">From 163 patients with clinical diagnosis of otomycosis, only 72 were confirmed by the mycological laboratory. No difference was noticed regarding the age and sex of patients. The clinical symptoms were the break of the timpanic membrane, secretion and fungal colonies in one side. Most of our patients had more than one year of evolution. The more common causative agent was Aspergillus and quite frequently it were present non-pathogenic bacteria. The local treatment with a solution containing vioform with salicilic acid was successful in the 82% of cases.</dc:description>
