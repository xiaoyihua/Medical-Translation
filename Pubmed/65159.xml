<dc:description xml:lang="en">In special designed vials using coverslides glued to segments of polyethilene test tubes of 0.15 ml of fibrin free blood were incubated during 45 min to 37 degrees C in a humid chamber. Blood samples were obtained from patients with disseminated Lupus erythematosus (DLE) and normal subjects (N). Adhered polymorpho-nuclear cells (PNC) to glass were washed with Hank's solution; immediately 0.15 ml of DLE or N serum containing 5X10(6) lymphocytes (L) were added to culture cells and incubated at 37 degrees C during 30 min. Lymphocytes were previously incubated at 37 degrees C during 30 min with either N serum or DLE serum. Thereafter the segment of polyethilene test tube was detached from coverslides and cells attached to glass was washed with Hank's solution and stained with Wright solution. PMN of DLE and N in presence of L of DLE and N incubated with fresh serum of DLE formed 5 to 15% of LE cells. Determining factor for LE cells formation is the serum of DLE. Slides contained only PMN and LE cells which make easy the observation of results. All possible combinations with PMN and DLE serum and N serum allowed inclusion of several negative or positive control groups.</dc:description>
