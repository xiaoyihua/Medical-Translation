<dc:description xml:lang="en">A retrospective review was performed of 43 clinical records of patients who underwent surgical treatment for low rectal cancer less than 12 cm from the anus in the General Surgical Service of the Hospital Militar "Dr. Carlos Arvelo" of Caracas, between 1969 and 1988. 21 patients (49%) were males and 22 (51%) females with an average age of 61 years. In 22 (51%) a sphincter saving resection (SSR) was done: 18 low anterior resection, 3 coloanal anastomosis and one pull-through, in 21 (46%) abdominoperineal resection (APER). All were adenocarcinoma except one, reported as a cloacogenic. 2 (9%) operative death were in the SSR and 7 (33%) in the APER. 4 (20%) patients with SSR died without recurrence and 2 (10%) with recurrence. In the group of APER 1 (7%) died without recurrence and 4 (29%) with local recurrence. A critical review was done of our experience and the international literature about the use of the SSR in low rectal cancer.</dc:description>
