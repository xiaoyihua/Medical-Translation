<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Corticoid administration is the usual treatment of Crohńs disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) attacks. However, information available on response rates and their predictive factors is scarce. OBJECTIVE To establish response to steroidal treatment in an homogeneous group of patients with CD or UC during their first admission to hospital. METHODS Restrospective analysis of 86 patients who received systemic steroidal treatment for a severe flare-up during their first hospital admission between 1995 and 2000. Patients were treated per protocol with fluid therapy, absolute diet, IV 6-methyl-prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day, and enoxaparin at prophylactic doses. Clinical response at 30 days was considered good in case of complete remission, and poor in case of partial or absent remission. Univariate and multivariate analyses according to non-parametric statistics were performed for sociodemographic and biologic variables. RESULTS 45 patients with CD and 41 with UC were included. Good response rates were 64.4% for CD and 60.9% for UC. The univariate analysis showed that patients with good response have shorter evolution times and fewer previous flare-ups (p &lt; 0.05) regarding CD. However, the multivariate analysis showed that none of the analyzed variables had predictive value. CONCLUSION The response rate of severe inflammatory bowel disease attacks to corticoids is around 60% in CD and UC. Data resulting from the current study cannot predict which patients will ultimately respond to therapy.</dc:description>
