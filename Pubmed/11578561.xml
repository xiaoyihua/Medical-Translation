RESULTS Health and social workers perceive the increase in the number of economic immigrants as a massive arrival. The main problems identified are: access restrictions to public health services for economic immigrants, the follow-up of these patients and diagnostic difficulties because lack of training in tropical medicine. Health and social workers's first proposal for improving this situation is their own training in tropical medicine.

Governmental Authority, instead, holds the legalization for all. In fact, economic immigrants are not concerned on health care because legalization and housing problems.
