<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess students' perception of domestic violence. METHODS The study was carried out in a random sample representative (n=5,982) of high-school students aged between 13 and 19 years in Chiapas and San Luis Potosi, Mexico, in 2003. The students answered a self-administered questionnaire on sexual education, sexuality, pregnancy and risk behavior, and domestic violence. Considering the effects of the sample design, a logistic regression analysis was carried out in order to verify the association between socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and risk of domestic violence. RESULTS The multivariate statistical analysis confirmed that female students are more vulnerable to domestic violence in both states studied (Chiapas: OR=1.87, p=0.01; San Luis: OR=1.53, p=0.00). Moreover, alcohol (Chiapas: OR=2.52, p=0.00; San Luis: OR=1.93, p=0.00) or drug use (Chiapas: OR=2.27, p=0.02; San Luis: OR=1.82, p=0.01) were the two most significant variables for students exposure to domestic violence. The association between alcohol consumption and student's age increases the risk of violence. The youngest students had 51% (Chiapas) and 73% (San Luis) more risk of experience violence by a relative than older students. CONCLUSIONS Teenagers remain one of the most vulnerable population groups to domestic violence due to their physical, affective, economic and social dependence on other adults. The study was one of the first attempts to measure domestic violence against students.</dc:description>
