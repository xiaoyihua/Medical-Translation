<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the location of hyperhidrosis, the accompanying signs and symptoms, and patient anxiety assessed on 2 scales and standardized psychometric instruments. PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective study of patients with hyperhidrosis was carried out between September 1, 2001 and June 30, 2003 with a self-administered preoperative questionnaire. The variables studied included the location of hyperhidrosis, the accompanying signs and symptoms, and the self-reported degree of anxiety and perception of its effect on daily life assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and a questionnaire designed in our department. RESULTS Palmar hyperhidrosis was reported by 93.6% of patients, plantar by 70.2%, axillary by 66.4%, facial by 12.1%, groin by 8.2%, chest by 5%, and abdominal by 2%. While more than 50% of the patients reported facial blushing and palpitations as accompanying signs and symptoms, approximately 30% experienced epigastric pain, trembling, and headaches. Over half of the patients reported that their anxiety was incapacitating, and a mere 1.2% experienced none at all. STAI scores were similar to those of the general population whereas scores on our department's questionnaire reflected those of the self-reported anxiety ratings. CONCLUSIONS Primary hyperhidrosis is a disorder in which excessive sweating occurs mainly, but not exclusively, on the palms. The condition is accompanied by signs and symptoms typical of autonomic nervous system hyperactivity and by a degree of anxiety that has an incapacitating effect on normal life, although that anxiety is not detected by the STAI questionnaire alone.</dc:description>
