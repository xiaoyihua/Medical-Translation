<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess compliance with hand hygiene (HH) in ICU workers before (P1) and after (P2) implementation of a HH promotion program and distribution of an alcoholic solution for HH, and to analyze factors independently associated to HH before and after patients care. DESIGN Fifty hours of observational evaluation were carried out during each period of the study (P1 and P2); the number of opportunities for HH (before and after patients care) was registered. Educational program (6 months): poster campaign, educational meetings with staff about HH, and the provision of alcohol hand rubs. SETTING ICU in a secondary level hospital. PARTICIPANTS Healthcare workers in the ICU. INTERVENTIONS A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate compliance with HH before and after implementation of the educational program. VARIABLES Dependent variable: HH compliance before-after patients care; independent variables that might be associated to compliance (including the educational program). RESULTS In P1 there were 338 opportunities for HH both before and after patients care, versus 355 in P2 (before and after patients care). The hand-washing rate was significantly higher in P2 than in P1 (prior to patient care: 45.3% and 34.9%, respectively, and after patient care: 63% and 51.7%, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, the educational program, together with other variables, was significantly associated to HH before and after patients care. CONCLUSION There was a significant increase in compliance with hand hygiene among the ICU personnel during the educational phase, both before and after patients care.</dc:description>
