<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The control of the breeding sites of mosquitoes of medical importance is essential for the anti-vector fighting programs; however, the efforts made so far have not great enough since the confirmed dengue fever cases gradually increase. OBJECTIVE To provide information on the main breeding sites of Aedes aegypti in an urban area with low vector density in Camagüey province. METHODS The urban universe was fully surveyed from January to December 2007. The collection procedure in the positive containers followed the National Vector Control program methodology. The characteristics of each container were written in a customized study form of positive blocks. The representative percentage of each positive container, as well as the proportion of larvae per container were determined. RESULTS Aedes aegypti formed colonies in 44 different containers, being the artificial reservoirs the predominant ones (97.73%). The majority were permanent, useful and unchangeable. Following the population's criteria, the combination of permanent plus useful is valid in 17 types of containers accounting for 38.36% and contributing 180 positive containers for 81.08% of the total number. The tanks placed on the ground reached 36.03% positivity. CONCLUSIONS The high number of mosquito-positive tanks demands greater individual responsibility in improving domestic sanitation and thus, the increase of awareness in order to achieve more active community involvement in this regard. The latter together with the strengthening of transectoriality will allow having an impact on the elimination and final disposal of all the useless materials that may serve as possible breeding sites of mosquitoes.</dc:description>
