<dc:description xml:lang="en">Are there specific psychiatric issues in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that force us to modify our typical model of care delivery in most communities? This appears to be the case. Most of these issues stem from the fact that the HIV-positive population has a high prevalence of a variety of psychiatric disorders. The integration of the psychiatric treatment with general medical treatment improves psychiatric and medical outcomes. Along this lines, how con understanding personality types improve our ability to prevent and treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Some people are far more likely to indulge in risky behavior than others. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic is driven by high-risk behaviors that are often associated with psychiatric disorders. Because of this, psychiatrists have an important role in the treatment and prevention of HIV. Furthermore, the current treatment for HIV requires strict adherence to complicated regimens, and untreated psychiatric disorders are a major barrier to effective treatment. Individuals who are "unstable" and/or "extroverted" make up the greatest group of patients in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinics. Understanding the dynamics of their character leads to better therapeutic approaches in their treatment. A cognitive behavioral approach that 1) focuses on thoughts instead of feelings, 2) uses a "behavioral contract", 3) emphasizes rewards, and 4) involves coordination with medical care providers, has been found effective in treating AIDS patients who are especially at risk.</dc:description>
