<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Domestic and wild triatomines in the department of Santander have an epidemiological impact, as recently they have been linked to outbreaks of acute Chagas disease. The analysis of their diversity and temporal variation contributes to the understanding of their biology and ecology in one of the most endemic areas of the country. OBJECTIVES To analyze triatominae diversity in two regions of Santander. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed the triatomine records for Santander contained in the CINTROP-UIS entomology lab database. We grouped the information for two regions: the Middle Magdalena area and the Andean region, and for each one we designed species accumulation and range-abundance curves, we calculated diversity and equality indices, and we analyzed colonization and temporal variation or persistence of the community. RESULTS Ninety five percent of triatomines came from the Andean area and 4.57% from Magdalena Medio, with nine and ten species each. The dominant species in the Andean area were Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma dimidiata while in Magdalena Medio they were Rhodnius pallescens and Panstrongylus geniculatus. We found a greater diversity and richness in Middle Magdalena compared to the Andean area. The temporal variation showed persistence of communities over time. CONCLUSIONS Results revealed differences in the diversity of the two regions and the potential of wild species to occupy artificial ecotopes. Triatomines intrusion and the recent involvement of wild species in the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi emphasize the need to further investigate the ecology of these vectors in order to guide population control strategies.</dc:description>
