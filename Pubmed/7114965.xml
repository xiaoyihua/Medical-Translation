<dc:description xml:lang="en">We studied patients with corrected transposition of the great arteries by M and bidimensional echocardiography. Three patients in situs solitus and one in atrial situs inversus. The characteristics of the atrio-ventricular valves, and it's relation with other heart structures was determined, as well as the ventriculo-arterial connections and the presence of associated defects. The approximations employed were parasternal and suprasternal. The cases of discordant ventriculo-arterial connection in atrial situs solitus showed mitro-pulmonary continuity. In these cases the pulmonary artery, located in a right posterior situation with respect to the aorta, became intensely opaque when contrast material was injected in a peripheral vein. In atrial situs inversus, the aorta had a right and anterior position. We conclude that it is possible to establish the diagnosis of atrioventricular discordance by an adequate systematization of the echocardiographic recordings.</dc:description>
