<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the results of retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) in patients with ≥2 cm stones treated in our center. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective review of 106 patients with renal calculi underwent RIRS ≥2 cm (period January 2009-December 2011). The procedures were performed under general anesthesia as a source of fragmentation using the holmium laser (30 W Litho Quantasystem) and flexible ureteroscopes (X2 Flex Storz, Olympus P5) through ureteral access sheaths. It discusses demographic variables (age, medical history, antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment, treatment of urolithiasis, BMI, ASA), treated stones variables (size, number, Hounsfield units, biochemical composition) and intra-and postoperative variables (operative time, number of pulses, hospital stay, complications) with the completion of a descriptive analysis of the same. To define our results we consider success to the complete absence of fragments or residual &lt;5 mm posterior imaging tests. RESULTS The mean stone size was 2.46 cm treated, being the only stone in 87.7% of cases. The most frequent location was the renal pelvis stones (44%) followed by the lower calyx (39%). The postoperative complication rate was 6.7%, with all of little relevance. The success rate with a single procedure was 79.4% to 94.1% with retreatment. CONCLUSION RIRS is a valid alternative for the treatment of kidney stones ≥2 cm for its high success rate and few complications if performed in specialized centers.</dc:description>
