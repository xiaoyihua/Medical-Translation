<dc:description xml:lang="en">The necessity of providing individuals experiencing first episode psychosis with early, comprehensive, and effective treatment, in order to improve their long-term prognosis, has been widely recognized. However, despite the important role of psychosocial interventions in treatment, only a portion of patients receive this type of care, and it is often of poor quality, especially in countries with limited resources. The Critical Time Intervention (CTI) model has been shown to effectively improve clinical and social outcomes of individuals with a history of psychosis, while also being cost-effective. It is a time-limited, community-based intervention, carried out by technical community workers who are specifically trained and continuously supervised by professionals. Therefore, CTI is a promising psychosocial intervention model for individuals experiencing a first psychotic episode, in countries with limited mental health service resources.</dc:description>
