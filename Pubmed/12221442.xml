<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to know the clinical behavior of Human Balantidiasis, five symptomatic cases are reported (three from hospital and two from private practice), observed from December 1993 to December 1996 in the city of Huaraz (3,100 Mt above sea level). All patients were from Ancash, being their mean age 57,2 years old (3-85); 4/5 were male, and 3/5 were farmers. They bred pigs, lived in a rural environment and had no access to drinking water nor to sewage at home. The mean length of this disease was 22,8 days (10-60). Clinical symptoms were dysenteric diarrhea and abdominal pain accompanied by fever, pallor, asthenia, weight loss and dehydration. All five cases presented the parasite in the feces: one as a cyst, two as trophozolte, and the other two, both shapes. Two patients suffered serious complications: The first one had intestinal perforation, peritonitis and died, and the other one presented bronchopneumonia, low digestive hemorrhage and sepsis. Treatment included tetracycline, metronidazole and large spectrum antibiotic, if required. When we observe a patient with hemorrhagic or chronic severe diarrhea in Huaraz, who comes from the rural area and is a breeder of pigs, we must consider a diagnosis based on Human Balantidiasis.</dc:description>
