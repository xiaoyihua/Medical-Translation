<dc:description xml:lang="en">Twenty-six patients with surface vesical tumor receiving epirubicin are included for prophylaxis of relapse following surgical exeresis. The dosage used was 15 endovesical instillations of 50 mg in 50 cc sterile water, one instillation a week during the first month followed by once monthly to complete a year. After an average follow-up of 14 months a percentage of 19% relapses were observed with a relapse are of 1.3. Toxic events were seen in 46.1% of cases, and were almost exclusively chemical cystitis. Due to intractable vesical intolerance 5 patients were withdrawn from the study. Epirubicin was shown to be effective in reducing the relapse rate but showed a high incidence of chemical cystitis.</dc:description>
