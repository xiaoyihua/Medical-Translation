<dc:description xml:lang="en">Using a strain of Ps. aeruginosa (A.T.C.C. 10.145), several preparations were obtained: cytoplasm, cellular wall, extract with veronal buffer and carbohydrates. A morphologic and biochemical study of the bacterium was performed and the soluble fractions were analysed by electrophoresis in poliacrilamide gel with strains for proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. The results led the following conclusions: 1. -Electrophoresis of cytoplasm in poliacrilamide gel made it possible to recognize 17 proteic, 9 carbohydrate and 3 lipid fractions. 2. -Eight of the protein fractions were combined with carbohydrates and 9 were proteins. 3. -The extract obtained with veronal buffer showed 12 protein, 7 carbohydrate and 4 lipid fractions. 4. -The seven carbohydrate fractions were combined with proteins. 5. -Five of the cytoplasm proteins fractions were not extracted with veronal buffer; two protein fractions extracted by veronal buffer were not from cytoplasm. 6. -Heating the extract obtained with veronal buffer determined the loss of most of the fractions extracted probably due to denaturalizations of the proteins. 7. -The heated extract obtained with veronal buffer showed diffuse bands coloured with protein, carbohydrate and lipid strains.</dc:description>
