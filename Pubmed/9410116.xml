<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To study the clinical manifestations of 86 patients with Mediterranean Boutonneuse Fever who were admitted in a University General Hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 1986 and 1994 we studied retrospectively the clinical manifestations, evolution and complications of 86 patients with Mediterranean Boutonneuse Fever. Diagnosis was based on clinical and serological findings. RESULTS We studied a total of 86 patients (64 males; 22 females) with a mean age of 55 years. 88% of cases were diagnosed between June and September, and 89% of them had contact with dogs. 53% of patients had an underlying disease. All patients presented with fever and a generalized erythematous rash. 60% of patients had a initial lesion (tache noire) especially in legs. All patients were treated with doxicycline during one week. 22% of patients had complications such as renal failure, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding and stroke. Old patients and those with underlying disease had severe complications with a higher significant frequency. No patients died. CONCLUSIONS 22% of patients with Mediterranean Boutonneuse Fever, especially those with advanced age or underlying disease, who were admitted in the Hospital had severe complications.</dc:description>
