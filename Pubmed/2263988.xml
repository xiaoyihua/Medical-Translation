<dc:description xml:lang="en">The need of increasing the amount and quality of applied research in the health field es emphasized. The social and economical determinants of health and health care services require a multidisciplinary approach. The most important issue is the utilization of research results in the definition of policies and in the decision making process. Some of the barriers and obstacles to implement research results are discussed as well as the strategies that can be put forward to overcome the former. It is suggested tah participatory research could be an innovative methodology to improve the application of research results. Participative research is a collaborative effort that involves different actors of the health arena including administrators, health personnel, community members, and the researchers themselves. This type of research carries out diagnostic and intervention activities from the very beginning of the studies; its main strength is that decision made and the community members are active participants, impinging a scientific approach to their daily work and so the application of results is facilitated through out the process.</dc:description>
