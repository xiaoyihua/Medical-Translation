<dc:description xml:lang="en">This article considers the situation of prisoners in Spanish jails, taking the circumstances of the inmates at the prison of Jerez de los Caballeros as a particular example. Documents from the Jerez Municipal Historical Archives were studied along with other contemporary and more current publications. The results show that the conditions of the buildings bordered on the ruinous, the facilities were in poor condition or unavailable and health and hygiene were practically inhumane. Pathologies of the prisoners posed a threat to the general population, as there was the risk of outbreaks of epidemics, but almost nothing is known about them. Efforts by the authorities to remedy structural problems and health problems were few and mostly ineffective due to due to economic difficulties. Medical assistance was provided by local doctors in exchange for a fee.</dc:description>
