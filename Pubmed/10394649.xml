<dc:description xml:lang="en">Crystal precipitation in urine results from factors such as ionic strength, pH, soluble complexes formation, formation site and retention of initial solid particle. Among the most frequent causes are poor diuresis and changes in urine pH, their influence being quantified in different ways. Effects of water diuresis such as prophylaxis for urinary calculi are due to the intrinsic properties of the water contained in the urine, solid particles dragging, action on urine infection and changes in urine pH. Urinary flow has an influence on pH, so that its decrease coincides with concentrate urine and low pH, whereas its increase involves the presence of dilute urine and high pH. The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between increased urine volume due to greater water intake and changes in urine pH, as well as the physiological intervening mechanisms.</dc:description>
