<dc:description xml:lang="es">Introduction. The rate of comorbidity between language disorders and behavioural, emotional and social problems is high. Aim. To review the literature on the social and emotional difficulties of children with specific language impairment from a developmental perspective. Development. In early childhood, findings concerning this kind of difficulties in children with delayed language development are not conclusive. Yet, as of the period of preschool education, research points to a greater occurrence of difficulties in the social and emotional area. The longitudinal studies that have made it possible to determine the psychosocial adjustment of teenagers suggest a greater risk of presenting experiences involving victimisation and bullying or of developing anxiety and depression in the long term, although some studies offer a more promising scenario. Conclusions. Disorders involving comprehension and the pragmatic component of language are an important predictor in the manifestation of socio-emotional alterations. In mixed comprehension-expression disorders, general difficulty in processing could at least partially account for this association. In turn, these limitations in the development of social cognition are likely to help explain, at least up to a point, the difficulties experienced by persons with pragmatic disorders, although the research conducted to date is not consistent in this sense (AU)</dc:description>
