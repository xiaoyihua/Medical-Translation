<dc:description xml:lang="es">Objective. To determine whether surgical treatment delayed for more than 48 hours in patients with cauda equina syndrome (CES) influenced the clinical outcome. Material and methods. A retrospective study of 18 patients treated in our hospital from March 2000 to January 2012, after presenting with CES. The pre- and post-operative clinical status was determined: existence of back pain and/or sciatica, sensory disturbance in the perineum, sensory and motor deficits in the lower extremities, and the degree of sphincter incontinence (complete or incomplete CES). A clinical assessment was performed using the Oswestry disability index. Results. As regards the onset of symptoms, 44% (8 of 18) of patients were treated at an early stage (within 48 hours). None of the patients with complete CES operated in the early stage had urinary incontinence, and also had greater motor recovery. Of the 5 patients with complete CES who underwent delayed surgery, 3 showed residual urinary incontinence. A mean of 12.55 was obtained on the Oswestry disability index scale at the end of follow-up. Conclusion. Although no statistically significant difference was found in our study, we observed greater motor and sphincter recovery in patients who were operated on within 48 hours (AU)</dc:description>
