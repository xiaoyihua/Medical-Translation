<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Intracoronary stenting has been proposed as an adjunct to balloon angioplasty in order to improve the immediate and long-term results. The purpose of this study was evaluate the short-term results, subacute closure rate and to try to identify angiographic predictors of subacute thrombotic after Palmaz-Schatz stent implantation. METHODS Through a prospective registry, we have evaluated in 500 patients the safety and efficacy of Palmaz-Schatz stent implantation (580 in total) in coronary arteries and saphenous vein grafts. The identification of clinic and angiographic predictors of subacute closure have been evaluated with the assistance of a BMDP statistical software using an univariate and multivariate statistical analysis (logistic regression). The determination of diameter and stenosis has been achieved by electronic caliper. RESULTS The stent was implanted successfully in 98.6% of the patients. There was no abrupt closure (&lt; or = 1 day), however 36 patients (7.2%) developed subacute thrombotic closure (among 2nd-21st day after stenting). The major complications were: death 9 patients (1.8%), bypass surgery 7 patients (1.4%) and myocardial infarction 21 patients (4.2%). The predictors of subacute thrombotic closure through univariate statistical were: stenting for bail-out (S.T.: 27%; p &lt; or = 0.0001), multiple stenting (S.T.: 24.1%; p &lt; or = 0.0001), final diameter stent &lt; or = 3.25 mm (S.T.: 12.6%; p &lt; or = 0.013), and left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; or = 45% (S.T.: 15.7%; p &lt; or = 0.022). We showed with logistic regression that final diameter stent &lt; or = 3.25 mm; p &lt; or = 0.0030, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; or = 45%; p &lt; or = 0.0012, stenting for bail-out; p &lt; or = 0.0195 and multiple stenting; p &lt; or = 0.0252, were predictors of subacute thrombotic closure. CONCLUSIONS The Palmaz-Schatz coronary stenting will preferably realize in those arteries bigger than 3.25 mm and left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 45%, showing multiple stenting and stenting for bail-out greater subacute thrombotic closure rate.</dc:description>
