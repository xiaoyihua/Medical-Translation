<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To describe patients who have four cardiovascular risk factors linked: hypertension, carbohydrate metabolic disturbances, overweight and dyslipaemia. To determine basal insulin levels. DESIGN A descriptive crossover study. SETTING Tórtola Health Centre, East Valladolid. PARTICIPANTS Of the 6,950 patients with medical records and over 45, 76 cases met the 4 factors. An appointment was made by phone to determine basal insulinaemia. RESULTS Average age was 64.38; 75% were women. 92.1% were non-smokers and 26.3% moderate consumers of alcohol. 43.4% were intolerant; the rest, diabetics. 52.6% received no drugs treatment. The commonest monotherapy was sulfonylureas and insulin. Mean BMI was 30.20, and obesity, 63.2%. The commonest hypertension drugs were ACEIs and diuretics, as monotherapy: both together was the commonest association. All the patients were hypercholesterolaemic. 25% were on antilipaemiant treatment, the commonest fibrates. All the patients were on a prescribed diet. 34.2% had hyperuricaemia. Mean insulinaemia was 12.63. There were 5 cases with high values. CONCLUSIONS There is 1.09% prevalence of the four cardiovascular risk factors linked. High levels of basal insulin were only found in 5 patients. Biguanidines were not used in treatment of DM II. There were more obese patients vs those with overweight. Failure of diet to control dyslipaemias. Insulin should not be systematically determined in primary care because it is of little use.</dc:description>
