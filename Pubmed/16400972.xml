<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary heart disease, are the leading cause of mortality in Spain and western countries. The prevention of complications is based on a cardiovascular risk stratification that is based on the presence of classical cardiovascular risk factors. There are many scales for cardiovascular risk stratification that classify subjects into low, intermediate or high risk. Despite the fact that the impact and treatment of risk factors are well known, their control remains poor. Obesity, diabetes, and hypertension seems also seem to be increasing trends due to the changes in lifestyles and nutritional habits of our communities. In recent decades some new, or emerging, cardiovascular risk factors have been identified that can improve the stratification of cardiovascular risk: C-reactive protein, homocysteine, and lipoprotein a. The metabolic syndrome is an association of cardiovascular risk factors that cluster in the same subject because they share a physiopathologic link: insulin resistance. Its presence is related to most cardiovascular risk factors, classical or emerging, especially obesity, hypertension, and C-reactive protein. On the other hand, detection of subclinical or incipient atherosclerosis, especially with the measurement of intima-media thickness, offers indirect information closely related to coronary atherosclerosis that improves the stratification of subjects at intermediate risk.</dc:description>
