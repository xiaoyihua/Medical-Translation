<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Insulin and leptin are involved in blood pressure (BP) homeostasis. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of gender, age, anthropometrics, leptin, fasting insulin concentration and insulin resistance index HOMA-IR (Homeostasis Model Assessment) on BP. PATIENTS AND METHOD We studied 194 non-diabetic asymptomatic volunteers (86 women, 108 men); subjects were classified into 3 groups according gender and age (&lt; 30 yr; 30-50 yr; &gt; 50 yr). BP, body mass index), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio were registered. Fasting plasma concentration of glucose, insulin and leptin were measured. HOMA-IR was calculated. RESULTS Systolic BP was significantly higher in males under 50 yr; after this age, was significantly higher in women. Diastolic BP showed a similar pattern, but after the age of 50 yr no significant differences between genders were observed. Both systolic and diastolic BP showed a significant correlation with body mass index and waist circumference in both sexes, and a significant correlation with age was observed only in women. Leptin was significantly correlated with both systolic and diastolic BP only in men. In a stepwise linear regression analysis, age was the only variable that significantly contributed to BP in women. In contrast, in men, leptin but not age was the variable significantly related to BP. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest a gender-difference in the association between leptin and BP, by which leptin in men and age in women are independent contributors.</dc:description>
