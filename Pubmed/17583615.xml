<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the first cause of childhood blindness in Argentina and is reaching epidemic proportions. To gain greater insight into the issues involved in this epidemic, we analyzed the characteristics of the infants referred for treatment of very severe ROP to the Dr. Juan P. Garrahan Pediatric Hospital, located in the city of Buenos Aires. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of patients referred for ROP from 01/01/96 to 12/31/03. Very severe ROP was defined as threshold disease or worse in both eyes, plus disease in zones 1 or 2, or Rush disease. Unusual patients were defined as those with very severe ROP with a gestational age (GA) of &gt; 31 weeks or birth weight (BW) &gt; 1500 g. Patients were divided into two groups according to the distance between the referring center and our hospital: group A consisted of those from nearby areas (&lt;or= 70 km) and group B comprised those from areas &gt; 70 km from the hospital. RESULTS During the study period, the number of cases progressively increased while the proportion of "unusual" patients slightly decreased. The total number of infants referred was 809 and 14 % were unusual patients; 55 % had very severe ROP, 89 % were treated, and 7 % were referred too late and lost the opportunity for treatment. Group B comprised 61 % of the infants referred. Very severe ROP was present in 53 % of patients in group A and in 56 % of those in group B. The mean GA was 29.5 +/- 3.1 weeks in group A and 30.8 +/- 2.6 in group B (p &lt; 0.001); 90.5 % of the patients in group A and 64 % of those in group B required mechanical ventilation (p &lt; 0.001). No predictors for very severe ROP were found in multifactorial analysis. CONCLUSIONS We report a childhood epidemic of blindness in which the prevalence of very severe ROP increased during the study period and the disease occurred in large, fairly mature newborns. The differences found in relation to the referring center and the lack of correlation between very severe ROP and prematurity or the use of mechanical ventilation suggests substantial disparity in healthcare, which should be taken into account when planning prevention strategies.</dc:description>
