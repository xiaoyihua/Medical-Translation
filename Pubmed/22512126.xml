<dc:description xml:lang="en">Rupture of Achilles tendon occurs at 2-6 cm from its attachment in the calcaneus; its frequency is estimated at 7-18 cases per 100,000 population in the United States and it occurs more frequently in males. The diagnosis is made clinically and with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging and treatment may be divided into acute or late. We present herein the use of allograft to treat patients with ruptures more than six weeks old; several techniques were used depending on the rupture site and the available allograft. Ten plasties were performed in ten patients with ruptures that occurred a mean of 8 months back; early rehabilitation was instituted and weight bearing was allowed at 4 weeks with a brace, which was removed at 12 weeks; patients could run at 12 weeks. Four wound dehiscence complications were reported, which resolved with second intention healing without the need for any other surgery, with good results and patient satisfaction.</dc:description>
