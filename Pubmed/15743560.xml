<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Surgical revascularization is the treatment of choice in patients with left main coronary artery stenosis. Conventional stents are not a valid alternative because of the rate of restenosis and sudden cardiac death. Drug-eluting stents, which reduce the rate of restenosis, may represent an alternative to cardiac surgery. The objective of this study was to describe the results with drug-eluting stents in patients with left main coronary artery stenosis who were poor candidates for surgical revascularization. PATIENTS AND METHOD We prospectively followed a consecutive series of patients who were poor candidates for surgical revascularization and were treated with implantation of a drug-eluting stent in the left main coronary artery between May 2002 and April 2004. In-hospital and long-term results were analyzed. Follow-up included angiographic and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies. RESULTS Forty-two patients (25 men, 59.5%) with a mean age of 70.1 (10.5) years were studied. Fourteen (33%) had diabetes, and 7 (16.7%) had a protected left main coronary artery. The reasons for ruling out surgery were poor distal vessels in 19 (45.2%), previous surgery in 9 (21.4%), age in 6 (14.3%), primary angioplasty in 5 (11.4%), and other reasons in 3 (7.2%). Four patients (9.5%) died before discharge, three of them after primary angioplasty. No in-hospital revascularization procedures were needed. Median follow-up time was 288 days; mean follow-up time was 315 (241) days. Another four patients died after discharge (9.5%) on days 5, 24, 34 and 115. Angioplasty was repeated in one patient, and another was referred for heart transplantation. CONCLUSIONS Drug-eluting stents represent a valid alternative in patients with left main coronary artery stenosis who are poor candidates for surgical revascularization. Randomized studies with a longer follow-up should be performed to evaluate their benefits in patients eligible for surgery.</dc:description>
