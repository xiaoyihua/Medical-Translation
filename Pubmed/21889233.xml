<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In 1890 four cases of headache associated with visual symptoms and hysterical disorder were described by the French neurologist Babinski as migraine ophthalmique hystérique, or hysterical ophthalmic migraine. Since that time this association has seldom been described, and the possibly high frequency previously reported still remains to be established. This paper has reused Babinski's description and it tries to rehabilitate the syndrome described by the French semiologist across the relatively frequent experience of this type of patients in a public hospital. Also it analyzes the reason of the oblivion of his description. METHOD This study presents a series of 43 cases of headache of the migraine type associated with other symptoms, most consistent with basilar-type migraine according to IHS criteria. Diagnosis of conversion disorder (hysteria) was grounded in the criteria set forth in the DSM-IV. RESULTS All patients exhibited one or more manifestations of hysteria (conversion symptoms) during migraine attacks, and some did in the intervals between attacks as well. Details of the headaches, associated symptoms, and hysterical manifestations are discussed. Most patients improved with antimigraine medication. Altered consciousness may have contributed to the onset of hysterical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS The basilar type migraine associated with conversion symptoms described of systematized form by Babinski, it is not a rare entity. Similar pictures have been described along the history of the medicine. The later silence possibly is due to the historical difficulty in defining accurately the conversión disorders. The Babinskís migraine is a certain well entity and must be recovered for the clinic.</dc:description>
