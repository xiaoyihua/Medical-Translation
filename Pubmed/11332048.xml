<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To estimate the aptitude for the critical reading of papers of clinic research of psychiatry residents of the Mexican Institute of the Social Security in Mexico City. METHODS A total of 34 residents from two hospitals (A and B) participated. Measuring instrument with abstracts of published research papers and 96 items was constructed to explore their abilities of interpretation, discernment and critical reading. Its reliability was of 0.88. RESULTS The median of Hospital A was 11 and Hospital B was 9 and the global of 9.5 (p NS). There were no differences of results according to the year of residency (I, II and III) nor in the indicators. Most of the participants (n = 26, 76%) had a score below 18 which would be the score if answered in a random fashion. CONCLUSIONS Critical reading of the participants was very low. Our results suggest that the bibliography sessions of the psychiatry residents were oriented to consumption of information and that critical reading of research papers was absent or very poor.</dc:description>
