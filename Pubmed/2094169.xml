<dc:description xml:lang="en">In rats, the effect of the separation from their mothers on the corporal weight and on the levels of adrenal hormones, adrenal and plasmatic corticosterone and adrenal catecholamines was studied. The litters were grouped according to: a) maintained with their biological mothers, and b) maintained with their mothers interchanged immediately after birth (foster mother). All were lactating mother rats. In group b) the corporal weight was lower (p less than 0.001) than in group a) from the 14th to the 28th day of life, their weight increased thereafter. The levels of adrenal corticosterone were higher (p less than 0.01) in group b), but the plasmatic corticosterone levels were similar to that in group a). With respect to catecholamines, the noradrenaline values were higher in group b) (p less than 0.001), whereas the adrenaline levels were lower (p less than 0.01) than those in group a).</dc:description>
