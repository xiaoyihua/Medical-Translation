<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Urinary incontinence is a frequent condition in women; it is estimated that it affects between 10% and 30% of women. The most common types are stress, urgency and mixed incontinence. It is a fact that this condition affects their quality of life. OBJECTIVE To assess the benefits of applying an integrated and standardized nursing intervention on women with a slight or moderate degree of stress, urge or mixed urinary incontinence. DESIGN Randomized, controlled clinical trial. LOCATION Area 6 of primary care in Madrid. PARTICIPANTS 256 women, 128 per group. INTERVENTION Systematized care plan for the intervention group (IG) and conventional plan for the control group (CG), depending on urinary incontinence type. RESULTS 59% of the total sample participated; 103 participants were followed: 48 from the IG (37.5%) and 55 from the CG (42.9%). The average difference in urine loss before and after intervention was 5.7 g (n = 22) for the IG, as opposed to 1.8 g (n = 27) for the CG; this reduction was not significant (p = 0.12), 95% CI [-1.09 - 8.92]. IU degree changes were assed by means of the Sandvik scale and were grouped in "women that improved or cured" and "women that remained the same or got worse" after interention. 40.5% of the women in the IG improved or cured, as opposed to 21% of the women in the CG (p = 0.059). CONCLUSIONS both care plans showed their efficiency to improve UI in this group of women. The mentioned improvement was greater in the IG than in the CG, with clinically relevant differences. The fact that some of the women gave up the project during the follow-up determined a power reduction of the study.</dc:description>
