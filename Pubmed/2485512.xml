<dc:description xml:lang="en">Infancy psychomotor yield in lower socioeconomic levels can be damaged from the first year of life. This implies future consequences to individuals, family-and society. Early stimulation programs have demonstrated to improve psychomotor yield in the above mentioned children. In Temuco, Chile, in groups of children with different risks, that were incorporated to an early stimulation program, it has been seen that the lower the birth weight the greater the risk of future psychomotor deterioration, which is also true for children that survived neonatal meningitis. On the other hand, in children that presented hyperbilirubinemia, low Apgar scores and neonatal septicemia, no significant statistical differences in psychomotor development have been observed in comparison with those of similar birthweight but without these antecedents. In this study the Chilean Health Ministry's Evaluation and Psychomotor Stimulation Program is reviewed as to adapt it for children at greatest risk.</dc:description>
