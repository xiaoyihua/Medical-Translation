<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The results of an epidemiological study on kidney trauma are presented. METHODS We reviewed the epidemiological factors in patients that had been admitted to hospital for kidney trauma from 1971 to 1992. RESULTS Blunt trauma (96.3%) was found to be more frequent than penetrating injuries (3.7%). Road traffic accidents were the main cause of kidney trauma (50.53%), which was more prevalent in the male (male to female ratio 3.75:1) and in the younger population (76% were aged 11 to 30 years). Associated extrarenal lesions were more commonly found in patients with severe renal trauma. CONCLUSION Renal trauma is relatively uncommon and is more prevalent in males in the second and third decades of life. The outcome depends on the degree of severity of the injury and the presence of associated extrarenal lesions.</dc:description>
