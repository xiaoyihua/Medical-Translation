<dc:description xml:lang="en">During health care services planning, rational and coherent information is required in order to allocate resources in accordance with local relative need. In an attempt to recognize the national condition, Stone's method was used. This is a semi-quantitative method for analysing the relationship between health care resources and need. Years of potential life lost index was used for need assessment among the states, and confronted to its Federal Public Health Investment. The optimum resource/need ratio is regarded as that pertaining to the reference population, the nation as a whole. Deviation from the optimum ratio in the states is interpreted as a manifestation of inequitable resource distribution. The results show striking differences in needs and resources. Resource/need ratio varied from 0.21 in Oaxaca to 3.79 in Distrito Federal. The states least favoured in resource sharing were Oaxaca, Puebla, Hidalgo and México. On the other hand, Tamaulipas, Baja California Sur, Quintana Roo and Distrito Federal exceeded the optimum. These indexes permit a quantitative expression of the relationship between need and resources in order to reach geographical equity.</dc:description>
