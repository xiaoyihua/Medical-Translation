<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The surgical treatment of focal intradural lesions is still a matter of considerable debate. This is especially important in the decision to evacuate brain contusions. We present the results of a prospective observational study in which the main goal was to analyze intracenter variability in the indication for surgery in focal posttraumatic intradural lesions in a department of Neurosurgery of a University Hospital with a specialized neurotrauma unit. CLINICAL MATERIAL AND METHODS Between May 1 and December 31, 2001, 32 patients with a closed traumatic brain injury and an intradural posttraumatic focal lesion were included. The patients studied were a subgroup included in the European multicenter observational study of the management of intradural lesions conducted under the aegis of the European Brain Injury Consortium (EBIC). RESULTS Intradural lesions &gt; 25 cc were immediately evacuated. Nine out of thirteen patients with lesions &lt; 25 cc also underwent surgery due to intracranial hypertension or neuroworsening. In all patients in whom lesions were surgically evacuated, the postoperative CT-scan showed neuroradiological improvement of the signs of mass effect or midline shift. CONCLUSIONS In our center, we found no evidence of significant variability in the indications for surgery in intradural lesions of more than 25 cc. However, significant differences were detected among neurosurgeons in the surgical indications for lesions below 25 cc. The small sample analyzed precludes generalization of these conclusions. The definitive results of the EBIC study will provide the neurosurgical community with a better understanding of variability in the management of these lesions.</dc:description>
