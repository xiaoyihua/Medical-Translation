<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Little information is available on drug adherence in older patients after discharge or on predictors of non-adherence. OBJECTIVES To determine the rate of treatment adherence and associated factors in elderly patients after hospital discharge with a view to identifying opportunities for improvement. METHOD We performed a cross-sectional study of 70 patients aged over 65 years old discharged from an internal medicine unit who were self-sufficient regarding treatment management. RESULTS Only 8.6% of patients complied with the recommended treatment. Eighty-five percent of the drugs were taken incorrectly: 67% were taken in excess, 33% were taken less than prescribed, and 54% were taken without following the recommendations concerning timetable and food intake. The most frequent reasons identified by the patients for not taking the medication correctly were lack of knowledge and forgetfulness. The most frequent risk factors were male gender, living with adult siblings, and taking a large number of prescribed medicines. Information given by the doctor about the treatment and assistance from a friend or relative at home increased adherence. CONCLUSIONS Treatment adherence after hospital discharge in patients aged over 65 years old is very low. Instruments should be sought to counter forgetfulness and recommendations should be adapted to improve patients' knowledge of prescriptions.</dc:description>
