<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Surgery is an essential element of breast cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to describe the progress and current practice in oncological breast surgery in Catalonia and Andalusia. MATERIAL AND METHOD An observational study was conducted, collecting data from the Minimum Basic Data Set at Hospital Discharge. RESULTS A total of 37,537 women from Catalonia and 24,186 from Andalusia were studied. The rate of admission due to breast cancer in women increased substantially during the study period, as well as the percentage of women who underwent breast-conserving surgery. However, the increase in breast-conserving surgery has not been consistent among age groups and hospital levels. CONCLUSIONS As a whole, the increase in breast-conserving surgery has shown the need for interventions to promote the use of procedures of proven effectiveness.</dc:description>
