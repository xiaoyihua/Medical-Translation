<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE There is the possibility of diagnosing azoospermia in cases of testicular tumours in patients who wish to preserve fertility. Our objective is to present a technique for obtaining spermatozoa from testicles with ex vivo tumours in order to preserve fertility in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A 34-year-old patient was referred for azoospermia. The physical examination revealed a node in the lower pole of the left testicle. In the scrotal ultrasound, the testicle presented disperse microcalcifications and a 1-cm hypoechoic mass in the lower pole. The tumour markers were negative, and the CT showed no distant disease. Left radical orchiectomy was performed, along with the placement of a testis prosthesis. Bench surgery was then performed, with extraction of the seminiferous tubules in the upper pole. RESULTS Of the submitted samples, 4 progressive and 1 nonprogressive motile spermatozoa were identified per field. Two samples were cryopreserved. The pathological report indicated the presence of a seminoma measuring 1.3 × 1 cm, with free margins and with no invasion of the rete testis (stage I). An assisted reproduction technique (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) was performed on the patient's partner with the frozen spermatozoa, which resulted in pregnancy and the subsequent birth of a healthy child. CONCLUSION We propose this technique as the method of choice for obtaining spermatozoa from patients who simultaneously present azoospermia and testicular tumours and who wish to preserve their fertility.</dc:description>
