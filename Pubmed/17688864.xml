<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Anemia is related to chronic and inflammatory diseases. Moreover, it is a factor of worse outcome in heart failure or myocardial infarction. Despite the importance of hemoglobin as a globular oxygen carrying protein, there are few studies on anemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency and the characteristics of the anemia in COPD patients admitted to a tertiary hospital within a one year period. METHODS Anthropometric and clinical data, tobacco habit, lung function tests, arterial blood gases and a basic study of anemia (BSA) were collected from digital clinical files. RESULTS A total of 177 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 70 (range 44-95), FEV1 was 35 (15%) and hemoglobin (Hb) 136(22) g/dl. Sixty-six (37%) patients had chronic respiratory failure (CRF) and 59 (33%) were receiving long-term oxygen therapy. A total of 56 (31%) had anemia (Hb &lt; 130 g/dl in men or &lt; 120 g/dl in women) with a mean Hb of 111(13). Anemia was normocytic normochromic in 32 cases (58%). BSA was obtained in 24 patients (42.85%) and showed that 10 patients (41%) had anemia of chronic disease, 6 patients (25%) had iron deficiency and 8 (34%) had other causes. It should be mentioned that 35 patients (53%) had CRF had anemia but only 8 patients had erythrocytosis (4.5%). CONCLUSION Anemia was frequent in these patients and was an underdiagnosed comorbidity.</dc:description>
