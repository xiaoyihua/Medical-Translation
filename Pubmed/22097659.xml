<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED INTRODUCION AND AIM: The enterostomy used in the treatment of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) causes many complications before and after its closure. The aim of this study was to examine the complications of closure aiming at determining the best timing for this operation. PATIENTS AND METHOD Retrospective review patients (p) below 1500 g with NEC in whom the enterostomy was closed in the last seven years. P were divided into two groups: PC (planned closure after uncomplicated postoperative period) and CC (advanced closure due to stomal--excessive looses--or to parenteral nutrition complications--septicemia, liver dysfunction-). We compared the age at closure, time of enterostomy, weight gain and complications. RESULTS Out of a total of 25 p requiring surgical treatment for NEC, 16 from the PC group and 9 from the CC group were included. The mean age at the moment of the closure were, respectively, 129 + 65 vs. 204 +/- 121 days (p &lt; 0.05). Weight at closure was 2665 +/- 841 vs. 4665 +/- 2076 g (p &lt; 0.05); the mean time with the enterostomy was 105 +/- 64 vs. 187 +/- 116 d (p &lt; 0.05), and the weight gain was 1779 +/- 859 vs. 3693 +/- 2155 g (p &lt; 0.05). After stomal closure, 7/16 p of the CC group (43%) and 2/9 of the PC group (22%) required reoperation due to severe complications (ns). In 4 of them, three of the CC group and one of the PC group, a new enterostomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS In p with enterostomy-related complications, closure has often to be advanced and it is performed in deficient nutritional conditions. Severe complications after enterostomy closure required reoperation in 43% of the CC group and in 22% of the PC group. Although there was no statistically significant difference, the trend indicates an augmented risk in CC group. The timing for enterostomy closure should be chosen individually. At the time of indicating the closure, the high risk of complications, should be taken into account particularly in preterms with enterostomy-related problems.</dc:description>
