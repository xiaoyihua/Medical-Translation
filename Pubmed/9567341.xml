<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hosts and their pathogens have co-evolved for millions of years, developing multiple and intimate interactions. Vertebrates have evolved a very complex immune system which pathogens have often been able to circumvent, in some cases even managing to appropriate some of its components for their own purpose. Among the pathogens which do use components of the immune system to survive and propagate, those coding for the expression of superantigens (SAgs) are now under intense scrutiny. Investigations concerning one of these pathogens, the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), led to the understanding of how the expression of such components is a critical step in their life cycle. A number of milk-borne exogenous MMTV infect mice shortly after birth and, when expressed, produce superantigens. Herein, we describe the biological effects of new variants of MMTV. Two of these, BALB14 and BALB2 encoding SAgs with V beta 14+ and V beta 2+ specificities, respectively, were present in BALB/c mice of our colony (BALB/cT); a third variant, termed MMTV LA, originated in (BALB/cTxAKR)F1 mice from recombination between BALB 14 and Mtv-7 endogenous provirus. The recombinant LA virus induces the deletion of V beta 6+ and V beta 8.1+ T cells as a consequence of the acquisition of SAg hypervariable coding region of Mtv-7. The SAg encoded by MMTV LA strongly stimulates cognate T cells in vivo leading to a very effective amplification of lymphoid cells in BALB/c mice, correlating with a high incidence of mammary tumors. These results suggest that the presence of non-productive endogenous proviruses--generally considered to confer a selective advantage to the host by protecting it from infection with exogenous MMTVs encoding cross-reactive SAgs--could also be advantageous for the pathogen by increasing its variability, thus broadening the host range and allowing the expansion of highly tumorigenic variants.</dc:description>
