<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dyslexia was first described over a century ago and since then many theories have been put forward to explain it, but we still do not have one single unified theory that explains the problem. Furthermore, over the years a great deal of research work has also been carried out that relates dyslexia with disorders in different brain structures, and yet we still do not have a clear idea of exactly which neurophysiological mechanisms are involved. It has been claimed, however, that the disorder may be caused by specific deficits in the left frontotemporal region or atypical asymmetries in the left perisylvian regions. Lastly, neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance or mapping of the electrical activity in the brain, have helped to further studies into dyslexia over the last decade. Recently, the introduction of magnetoencephalography in the study of the brain has opened up a whole new range of possibilities that will allow most of the controversial points raised by research into dyslexia using neuroimaging techniques to be resolved empirically.</dc:description>
