<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The Spanish Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (AEDV) has decided that a Strategic Plan is needed to help the association adapt to new circumstances and anticipate future developments. OBJECTIVES 1) To position the AEDV as a medical association that can exert an influence in everything related to dermatology. 2) To contribute to the development of the specialty, strengthening the prestige and reputation of dermatology and dermatologists. 3) To establish a model for operating and strategic thinking that can be handed on to successive Boards of Directors and will enable the Academy to identify future challenges. METHODS The approach used to develop the Strategic Plan was as follows: analysis of trends in the health care system; assessment of the current situation of AEDV and of dermatology in general through an internal analysis based on surveys and interviews with academics; analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats; preparation of a mission statement; and identification, development, and implementation of a strategy map prioritizing strategic lines of action. RESULTS The strategy map set out 16 general goals grouped into 4 main topics (achieving the vision, internal and external customers, internal processes, and innovation) and detailed in an action plan with 19 initiatives, each with specific actions. The plan will be monitored by the Strategic Plan Monitoring Committee, which is made up of the members of the Standing Committee and the chairs of the 9 Technical Committees responsible for implementing the initiatives. COMMENT The Functional Plan should guide the management of AEDV until 2017, and its implementation will enable the association to contribute to the development and prestige of the specialty and position itself as a reference in terms of its functional model.</dc:description>
