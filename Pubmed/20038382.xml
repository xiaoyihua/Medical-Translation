<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED OBJECTIVE. To determine the hemoglobin level variations in non-bleeding patients, its possible relationship with the blood volume drawn and number of extractions. METHODS An observational, prospective study conducted from April to August 2007. Hemoglobin values during the ICU stay, blood volume drawn in each phlebotomy, fluid balance, APACHE II and other demographic variables were determined. RESULTS One hundred and twenty four patients were studied. Of these, 59.7% experienced a mild decrease of hemoglobin levels (&lt; 2g/dl) whereas 21.8% presented a more severe reduction (&gt; 2g/dl). These decreases were correlated with the blood volume withdrawn and number of phlebotomies performed (r= 0.557, p &lt; 0.000). There was no significant relationship between fluid balance and decrease in hemoglobin. CONCLUSION. Anemia in critical ill patient seems to be related to blood volume drawn and number of phlebotomies.</dc:description>
