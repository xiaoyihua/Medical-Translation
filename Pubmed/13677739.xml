<dc:description xml:lang="en">The author sets out to know the degree of use of the Nursing Treatment Process (NTP) and its possible relationship with these factors: its profile, knowledge about NTP and the Virginia Henderson Model (VHM), nurses case loads and nurses opinions. The subjects in this study have been nurses in the Sant Martí sanitary district in Barcelona. The methodology used consisted in transversal and qualitative descriptive studies performed in 2001; the use of NTP by means of an audit of at home patient visits, NTP-VHM knowledge and profile by means of an anonymous self-administered questionnaire which had 30 theoretical-practical questions; nurses case load study by means of an analysis of the population attended to by nurse per year and nursing activities; and a qualitative study which used opinion questions and interviews.</dc:description>
