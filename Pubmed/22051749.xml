<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The current treatment recommendation for chronic hepatitis C virus infection is the combination of peginterferon and ribavirin for 24 or 48 weeks, depending on the viral genotype. The aim of the therapy is to obtain a sustained virological response. AIM To report our experience in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. MATERIAL AND METHODS Analysis of 52 patients treated between September 2000 and June 2009. Patients with genotype 1 or 5 were treated with peginterferon alpha 2a (180 ug/week) and ribavirin (1000 mg/day for those weighing less than 75 kg and 1200 mg/day for those weighing more than 75 kg) during 48 weeks. Patients with genotypes 2 and 3 were treated for 24 weeks with the same dose of peginterferon and ribavirin 800 mg/day. RESULTS Viral genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 5 were present in 81, 4, 11 and 4% of patients, respectively. Twenty four patients (46 %), 18 with genotype 1, achieved a sustained viral response. Age was the only variable that influenced the response to treatment. CONCLUSIONS Approximately half of the patients with chronic hepatitis C, achieve a sustained viral response with peginterferon and ribavirin.</dc:description>
