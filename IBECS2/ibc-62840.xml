<dc:description xml:lang="es">Introduction: Testicular microlithiasis (TM) is an infrequent finding in testicular ultrasound and its clinical importance has not been completely defined. We analyzed the ultrasounds of patients with testicular germ cell tumors in order to analyze the correlation between TM, histological findings and clinical variables. Methods and materials: Fifty-seven patients with germ cell tumors and radical orchiectomy were included. Clinical, pathological, and echographic data were analyzed. Results: TM was observed in 27 men (48.27%) and was absent in 30 (52.6%). Patients with TM had a greater likelihood of non seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) vs seminomatous (55.6% vs 30%,p=0.05), stage II/III testicular cancer (51.8% vs 16.7%, p=0.005), positive surgical margins (18.5% vs0%, p=0.021), and spermatic cord invasion (14.8% vs 0%, p=0.048). No significant difference was found in respect to other histopathological variables. Conclusion: This study showed that TM in testicular tumors is associated to NSGCT, advanced clinical stage, positive surgical margins, and spermatic cord invasion (AU)</dc:description>
