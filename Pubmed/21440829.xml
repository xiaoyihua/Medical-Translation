<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE This study was undertaken to compare the ocular haemodynamic effects of Combigan(®) versus placebo in patients with ocular hypertension (OHT). METHODS Thirty patients with OHT were included in a controlled, randomised, double blind study in two parallel groups; 15 were randomised to receive Combigan(®) and 15 to receive placebo for a period of 3 months. At baseline and at 3 months retrobulbar blood flowmeasurements of the ophthalmic artery (OA) and central retinal artery (CRA) were taken using colour Doppler imaging(CDI) ultrasound, concurrently with intraocular pressure (IOP). RESULTS Combigan(®) significantly reduced IOP after 3 months of treatment (P = 0.001), whereas placebo showed no significant change in IOP. The baseline haemodynamic parameters were similar between treatment and placebo groups. Patients treated with Combigan® showed a statistically significant decrease in CRA resistive index (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS Patients treated for 3 months with Combigan(®) showed a significant decrease of CRA resistive index that could be explained by the decrease in IOP.</dc:description>
