<dc:description xml:lang="en">It has been 45 years since John C. Burch first described his "colposuspension of the Cooper's ligament" technique for the surgical management of stress urinary incontinence. Half a century later, his legacy remains alive. His technique, and its further modifications, still occupies a privileged place among the surgical options for the management of the stress urinary incontinence. Even now, Burch procedure is considered the gold standard with which all the other new techniques must be compared in order to measure their effectiveness. In the past few years, there have been important advances in the knowledge and standardization of the female urodynamics. This has increased the accuracy of the medical assessments to have a better selection for this surgical procedure. Then, with the technique focused on such cases, the results of the procedure have been optimized, considering that its complications are not serious and they are relatively infrequent. The success rates of this technique are up to approximately 90% in 5 to 10 years follow-ups and 69% in 10 to 20 years follow-ups. Therefore, it is believed that Burch's urethropexia continues contributing greatly to the management of the stress urinary incontinence. This revision includes 33 articles, all of them related with this matter from Ovid database.</dc:description>
