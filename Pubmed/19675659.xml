<dc:description xml:lang="en">DESCRIPTION Recently, the Foundation has proposed new definitions KDIGO to refer to the alterations of bone - mineral metabolism in patients with chronic renal disease (CRD), relegating the traditional term of renal osteodystrophy (ODR). RECOMMEND: The term ODR exclusively to define alterations in bone morphology and architecture characteristic of the ERC. - And the term of bone-mineral alteration associated with the CRD to describe biochemical changes, and skeletal calcifications that occur as a result of alterations in mineral metabolism in the CRD. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The different metabolic abnormalities are secondary to the progressive loss of renal mass and renal function that leads to retention of phosphorus and a decrease in the levels of calcitriol which are responsible for the skeletal resistance to the action of PTH. CLINICAL FEATURES The main clinical manifestations of abnormal bone mineral metabolism are posttransplantation osteoporosis and osteopenia producing an increase in fractures, osteonecrosis, and bone pain. DIAGNOSTIC METHODS Biochemical parameters (calcium, phosphorus, PTH, 25 hydroxyvitamin D), X-ray bone densitometry and bone biopsy. (Evidence B). THERAPEUTIC ALTERNATIVES: It is recommended for the treatment and prevention of osteopenia - osteoporosis in transplant patients based on data from clinical evidence available from other study populations, such as in patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition to specific treatment, we must take into account the preventive measures to reduce the risk of fractures. Treatment includes specific measures for the prevention of bone loss (active metabolite of vitamin D analogues and bisphosphonates) and the treatment of persistent hyperparathyroidism (calcimiméticos).
