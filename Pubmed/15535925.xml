<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Since healthcare workers can transmit the influenza virus to high risk patients, they should be vaccinated prior to the influenza season. In this study we describe the influenza vaccination coverage in healthcare workers in a general hospital and study its evolution over the last years. SUBJECTS AND METHOD Descriptive epidemiological study to determine the anti-influenza vaccination coverage in healthcare workers in a hospital during 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 seasons. The variables studied in each season were sex, age and professional category. RESULTS During each of the campaigns, 1,215 and 2,287 workers were vaccinated. The vaccination coverage increased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) (20.2% in 2002-2003 and 38% in 2003-2004). Men were vaccinated more than women although the coverage increase was significant in both sexes (p &lt; 0.01). During the 2002-2003 season, workers older than 50 years (24.4%) had the greatest coverage, while during 2003-2004 those older than 31 years (48.7%) were the ones with more coverage. By professional categories, the medical staff (33.8% in 2002-2003 and 59.9% in 2003-2004) had a greater vaccination acceptance. The coverage increase during these two years was significant in all healthcare workers (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS A significant increase in the vaccination coverage has been observed during the two seasons studied. This fact can be related to the changes introduced in the informative strategies and the performance of more active vaccination campaigns which connect vaccination to employment areas.</dc:description>
