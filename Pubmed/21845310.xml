<dc:description xml:lang="en">Recently, the translational research model (TR) has been established as a key feature in health worldwide. The objectives of this review are: (1) to define the TR and describe its complex nature; (2) to identify the components of the TR; (3) to link the TR to the decision-making process in health policies; (4) to recognize frequent obstacles and challenges of the association between the TR and the decision-making process in health policies. A systematic literature review was conducted in scientific databases and selected grey literature was done including TR and health policy as key words. We found 60 papers. Results show that the concept of TR and its theoretical formulation has evolved over time and has only recently incorporated the complexity that exists in the transference of scientific knowledge to health. International literature shows different applications of the TR in both research and clinical practice. The application of the TR to public health and health policy decision making is relatively new but necessary and could become a priority for health policies in the countries.</dc:description>
