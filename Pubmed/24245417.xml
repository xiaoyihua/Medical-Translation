The calculations were performed using SPSS 17.0. RESULTS The sample included 380 children, 63% male, ages 3 (0.5-11) years. Delay in triage was 4 (0-15) minutes and the duration of 5 (2-7). The reasons for consultation were fever 54 (49-59)%, cough 45(40-50)%, pain 14 (11-17)%, skin/mucous lesions 13 (10-16)%, vomiting 10 (7-13)%. The level distribution was for 2th triage level 5 (3-7)%, 3th level 23 (19-27)%, 4th level 28 (26-30)% and 5th level 44 (39-49)%. Care protocols were fever 20 (16-24)%, respiratory distress and vomiting/diarrhea, 7 (4-10)% and pain 3 (1-5)%. In 20% the nurse start treatment prior to consultation. 22% remained under observation. 20% received health education. There were 3% of complications. The 2% accurate referral. The 53% of the reasons for non-serious inquiries are classified as susceptible finalist care by nurse. DISCUSSION The results expand the perspectives of finalist nursing areas.
