<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Feedback is one of the most important tools to improve teaching in medical education. AIM To develop an instrument to assess the performance of clinical postgraduate teachers in medical specialties. MATERIAL AND METHODS A qualitative methodology consisting in interviews and focus-groups followed by a quantitative methodology to generate consensus, was employed. After generating the instrument, psychometric tests were performed to assess the construct validity (factor analysis) and reliability (Cronbach&#146;s alpha). RESULTS Experts in medical education, teachers and residents of a medical school participated in interviews and focus groups. With this information, 26 categories (79 items) were proposed and reduced to 14 items (Likert scale 1-5) by an expert&#146;s Delphi panel, generating the MEDUC-PG14 survey, which was answered by 123 residents from different programs of medical specialties. Construct validity was carried out. Factor analysis showed three domains: Teaching and evaluation, respectful behavior towards patients and health care team, and providing feedback. The global score was 4.46 ± 0.94 (89% of the maximum). One teachers&#146; strength, as evaluated by their residents was &#147;respectful behavior&#148; with 4.85 ± 0.42 (97% of the maximum). &#147;Providing feedback&#148; obtained 4.09 ± 1.0 points (81.8% of the maximum). MEDUC-PG14 survey had a Cronbach&#146;s alpha coefficient of 0.947. CONCLUSIONS MEDUC-PG14 survey is a useful and reliable guide for teacher evaluation in medical specialty programs. Also provides feedback to improve educational skills of postgraduate clinical teachers.</dc:description>
