<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the mid-term evolution of high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) initially treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) and to compare the role of surveillance and postoperative radiotherapy, either adjuvant (aRT) or salvage (sRT). METHODS Retrospective study of 390 patients with PCa treated with RP at our institution from February 1988 to December 2012. Those in stage pT3 or higher and/or with positive surgical margins (PSM) were included. They were divided in three groups: group 1, undergoing surveillance after RP; group 2 receiving aRT; and group 3 receiving sRT. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS 156 patients were analyzed. Mean age was 63.8 ± 6.9 years (45-79). Mean follow-up was 58 ± 45 months; 71 (45.5%) had PSM, 40 (25.6%) were in stage pT3 or higher, and 45 (28.8%) had both features. Group 1 included 91 patients, group 2, 43 and group 3, 22. Initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 12.8 ng/ml in group 1, 14.9 ng/ml in group 2, and 14.5 ng/ml in group 3 (p = 0.07). First postoperative PSA was 0.27, 0.87, and 0.50 ng/ml in group 1, 2 and 3, respectively (p = 0.007). Seven men died of PCa: three in group 1, three in group 2, and one in group 3 (p = 0.6). The CSS at five and 10 years was 100 and 89% for group 1, 95 and 80% for group 2, and 94 and 94% for group 3 (p = 0.71). CONCLUSION Our results retrospectively show that surveillance, aRT and sRT are equivalent for the mid-term control of PCa after RP.</dc:description>
