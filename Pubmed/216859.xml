<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors studied the skin disorders in 50 patients who have undergone renal transplantation. They observed: -- Viral infections (herpes simplex, herpes Zoster, warts) in 56% of the patients. -- Bacterial infections in 36%, resulting in septicemia in 8% of the cases. -- Fungal infections in 26% of the patients. These infections appeared more severe than usual and recurred frequently. The occurence of several infections processes in the same patient was not uncommon. The clinical aspect and high incidence of various infections is related to immunosuppresive therapy. However, there is no clear-cut correlation between the type of infection and the type of treatment used. -- Squamous cell carcinoma occured in one patient. A high incidence of malignancies is known to occur in immunosuppressed patients. -- Skin signs related to hemodialysis (pruritus, hypermelanosis, skin dryness, vascular disturbances) regressed. -- The incidence of adverse reactions to drugs was high. -- 4 cases of ulcerations of the oral mucosa probably related to Azathioprine were observed.</dc:description>
