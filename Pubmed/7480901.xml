<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors report the results of mini-cholecystectomy performed through a 3 to 4 cm long subcostal incision in 29 patients with the diagnosis of acute or chronic cholecystitis, from February 1991 to November 1922. Some of the patients were obese, diabetics or presented as emergency cases. The patients were operated on in the morning, as in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, began oral intake in the afternoon and were discharged on the day after surgery. Dissection of the gallbladder was facilitated by the use of a modified gynecologic valve and long thin instruments. Duration of surgery varied from 40 to 140 minutes. Patients could return to work on the third day after surgery. Notably, the costs/benefits were on the third more favorable than those of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</dc:description>
