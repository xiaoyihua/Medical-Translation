<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Biventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and left dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy forms had recently been included in the spectrum of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. The aim of the study was to describe, using cardiovascular magnetic resonance, the patterns of ventricular involvement as well as late gadolinium enhancement in these conditions. METHODS Medical databases and records from the cardiology units of 3 hospitals were reviewed to obtain data from patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. RESULTS Twenty-six consecutive patients were included (40 [16] years, 16 males). Right ventricle involvement was present in 19 patients (73%). Among them, 13 patients (50%) had volumes over the upper limit of normality, 11 (42%) patients had late gadolinium enhancement in right ventricle and 6 patients (23%) had just mild involvement with wall motion abnormalities or microaneurysms. Left ventricle involvement was present in 24 patients (92%), all of them with late gadolinium enhancement. In 15 patients (57%) left ventricular systolic dysfunction was observed, and dilatation in 3 patients (11%). Late gadolinium enhancement was more frequent in the inferior, lateral, and inferolateral walls (65%, 57%, and 61% of patients, respectively) while septum was seldom affected (26% of cases). The pattern of late gadolinium enhancement was mainly subepicardial (46% of patients) or transmural (19%), and was intramyocardial in only 12% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS In this sample, left ventricle involvement is very common. The most frequent finding was left ventricular late gadolinium enhancement, while the least frequent was dilatation. The pattern of late gadolinium enhancement was more frequently subepicardial and located in the inferior and inferolateral walls.</dc:description>
