<dc:description xml:lang="en">The early and late (2-12 months) complications of in situ bypass for 24 patients (limb salvage procedures) were presented. The early complications were: 1. Overlook branches of saphenous vein developed into A-V fistulas which religated (2 patients). 2. Graft occlusions (2 patients). A successful thrombectomy was carried out on one patient, while an above knee amputation was performed on the other patient. 3. A deep venous thrombosis (one being crural, the other femoral) was treated with medication therapy. We recorded late complications: two graft occlusions (after 3 and 6 months) where redo surgery was impossible for distal progression of occlusion disease. The following procedures must be done: per-operative angiography, adequate technique of anastomoses and defects of the femoral vein, postoperative application of medication therapy, observation of patients in the later post-operative period and routine control with Doppler US (1, 3, 6, 12 months).</dc:description>
