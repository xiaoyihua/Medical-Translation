<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Allergic diseases affect a great proportion of seniors. OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of allergen sensitization in this age group in the western of Mexico. METHODS A retrolective study related to skin prick tests with a common allergen panel was performed on the first consultation in elderly patients during a period of three years in Guadalajara, Mexico. RESULTS We included 60 subjects, with an average of 67.7 years old; 83.3% were women. Diagnosis of allergic rhinitis was present in 60%, allergic rhinitis plus asthma in 30%, and asthma alone in 10%. Non atopic comorbidities were present in 56.7% of the cases. Median serum IgE was 124.95 UI/ml, the average of positive skin prick tests was 4 (1 to 21); 13.3% were sensitized to just 1 aeroallergen, and 55% were to more than three aeroallergens. Sensitization to pollens was predominant, even more to tree pollens. One by one, house dust mite, Fraxinus sp and Amaranthus palmeri were the most commonly found. Diabetes was associated to a lower positive prick test (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS The most common sensitizing allergens are similar for other age groups from the same area. Elderly patients with diabetes had lower positive allergen skin tests. Itís recommended to identify the allergen sensitization in seniors with allergic disease symptoms, as part of their clinical evaluation.</dc:description>
