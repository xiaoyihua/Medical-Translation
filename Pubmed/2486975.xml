<dc:description xml:lang="en">From August 1988 to January 1989 at the Obstetrical service of the "Nuevo Hospital Civil de Guadalajara" we studied 150 patients with cesarean section without risk of infection. Three groups of 50 patients each were formed. Group A: had no antibiotics; Group B: antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin, and Group C: ampicillin plus gentamicin for 7 to 10 days. The results were similar in the three groups as to patient's age, obstetrical history, cesarean section's indication, type of amniotic fluid, sex-weight and Apgar of the newborn, curve of body temperature, white blood cells and bands intrahospital. Only one patient had infection of the wound of the group A and other patient of the group C; from group B had a subaponeurotic hematoma (p less than 0.7). We concluded that the antibiotics must not use routinely, only when the patients have an infection risk.</dc:description>
