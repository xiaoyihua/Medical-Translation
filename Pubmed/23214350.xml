<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Transient elastography (TE) is a noninvasive method for assessment of hepatic fibrosis. OBJECTIVE To present the first case series evaluated in Latin America, in an University Hospital in Buenos Aires, during an 18-month period. METHODS Data was collected between August 2009 and January 2011. A database was built considering clinical, biochemical and histology data. The exams were performed with a medium probe. An exam was considered valid when success rate was higher than 60% and interquartile range lower than 30%. RESULTS 1,023 studies were performed. Patients were referred by in-hospital (53%) and out-hospital physicians (47%). Etiologies were: HCV 409 (40%), NAFLD 213 (20.8%), HBV 110 (10.7%), cholestasis 93 (9.1%), other 198 (19.4%). Significant fibrosis (F &gt; 2) was detected in 32.4% HCV, 32.1% HBV 31.5% NASH, and 33.4% cholestasis. Exams were not technically achievable in 29 patients (2.8%), of whom 96.5% had body mass index (BMI) higher than 28 kg/m2. However 117 of 145 patients with BMI higher than 28 kg/m2 had a successful exam. In 332 patients simultaneously biopsies (less than 6 months) were obtained, with overall coincidence of 77%. In 21 HCV transplanted patients coincidence was 90.4%. CONCLUSION Similar results to those in the literature were obtained, with excellent biopsy correlation in HCV transplanted patients. The increasing use of TE in the assessment and monitoring of chronic liver diseases has become evident by both increasing number of exams and decreasing number of diffuse liver biopsies.</dc:description>
