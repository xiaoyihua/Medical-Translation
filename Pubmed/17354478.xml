<dc:description xml:lang="en">This article describes a group technique designed to assist (affective and contention needs from) relatives of children who have suffered HUS. It consists on group meetings, called Life-Experience Workshops, where central topics considered important by the participants are discussed. These group meetings with HUS patient's relatives have no reported precedents and permit analyzing the traumatic value of life-experiences during and after the disease acute phase and its impact on the family involved. As a conclusion, it is considered that this first step opens possibilities to continue working and searching in this field, unexplored so far. A contribution to an integral approach for the child and his or her family is pursued, which complements medical treatment with a psychological and social perspective.</dc:description>
