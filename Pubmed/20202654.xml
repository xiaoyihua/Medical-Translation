<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Few data exists in the literature about intravenous antibiotic treatment of hepatic abscess in hospital based care units. Our objectives were to analyze the efficacy and safety of intravenous antibiotic therapy and the predictors of hospital readmission. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included all the patients admitted in our home care unit for intravenous antibiotic treatment of hepatic abscess from March 2006 to June 2009. RESULTS We included 30 patients in the study. Five patients (16,6%) had phlebitis during treatment and none presented a major secondary effect. Mean size reduction of abscess during admission in our home care unit was 49,3% (36,6%). Nine (30%) patients were readmitted, 6 (20%) during admission at home and 3 (10%) along the year after. Four (13.3%) patients died along follow-up. Patients readmitted had a higher mean size of abscess at discharge from our home care unit as compared to the non readmitted ones (4,5 vs 1,5 cms P=0,001), besides a minor percentage of reduction of size (19% vs 64% P=0,001). Female patients were readmitted more frequently than male ones (77,8% vs 28,6% P=0,02), but they had minor scores of Barthel scale (75 vs. 92 P=0,01). CONCLUSIONS Home intravenous antibiotic treatment of hepatic abscess seems to be a safe and effective alternative in most patients. The size and reduction of abscess at patient discharge, the female gender and dependence degree constituted the principal predictors of readmission.</dc:description>
