<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of the study is to determine the characteristics of patients who are operated on because of a nasal or septal deformity: clinical features before surgery, physical examination, anterior active rhinomanometry, and computed tomography (CT). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed prospective data collected on 372 patients operated on between January 1998 and June 2002 by means of a septoplasty or a rhinoplasty. RESULTS Gender distribution was: 253 male, 119 female. A smaller percentage of men underwent correction of pyramidal deformities in comparison to women. Nasal endoscopic examination diagnosed associated inflammatory pathologies in 12.4% of patients. We found a significant relationship between previous nasal trauma, laterorrinia and defects of the dorsum. Anterior active rhinomanometry had a high variability between patients. CONCLUSIONS Prospective data collected on these patients was useful to know more precisely our activities and how to adapt them to suit management decisions. Endoscopic examination proved high efficiency in the diagnosis of this pathology.</dc:description>
