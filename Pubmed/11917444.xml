<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine Barrett's esophagus (BO) prevalence in patients diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma (CC) and feasibility-associated factors in a 10 week period from March 1st to June 15, 1999. PLACE Endoscopy Department, Oncology Hospital, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, IMSS. METHOD A prospective, transversal, observational and comparative assay of 48 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma in whom high endoscopy with biopsy harvest was performed; otherwise, colonoscopy was performed in eight patients with confirmed BO. RESULTS Thirty men and 18 women were studied with an average age of 53 years of age. In 100%, colon cancer was determined as adenocarcinoma and location were rectal in 43.7%. Prevalence of BO was 22.9% in addition to 0.74 to 2% in the general population. This implies an odds ratio calculated at 36.43 (p = 0.00000) and 3.09 p = 0.00007), respectively, for risk to present BO concomitant with CC. There was no statistical significance in relation to age, smoking habit, and/or alcoholism. Among eight patients with BO without CCR, only one had a tubulovellous polypus (12.5%) identified. CONCLUSIONS Although the results were not to conclusive to affirm the association of BA with CCR, the high prevalence found justifies the performance of routine endoscopy in CCR carrier patients with reflux symptoms.</dc:description>
