<dc:description xml:lang="en">We have studied the distribution of the coronary reserve, evaluated by serial effort tests, in patients with proved coronaropathy, determining the correlation between clinic (effort and mixed angina) and coronary reserve (fixed and variable), assessing angiographic findings in function to that reserve. We took 120 patients with stable angina to whom 2 effort tests were performed, basal and after vasodilator drugs. It was considered variable reserve if in the second test the S-T descend improved greater than or equal to 1 mm for a similar of greater double product and fixed when it didn't improve. In all patients coronarography was performed. Seventy two patients (60%) showed fixed reserve, 58 with effort angina (80%) and 14 (20%) with mixed. Forty eight showed variable reserve, 40 (80%) with mixed angina and 8 (17%) with effort. The group with fixed reserve had a greater S-T max. descent (2.9 +/- 0.9 vs 2.2 +/- 0.4) (p less than 0.001), a lower double product max. (221 +/- 44 vs 284 +/- 37) (p less than 0.001) and a lower maximal oxygen consumption (MVO2 7 +/- 2 vs 11 +/- 2) (p less than 0.001) than the variable reserve group. Considering the angiography, the fixed reserve group had more number of vessels affected (1.9 +/- 0.7 vs 1.4 +/- 0.5) (p less than 0.01), a higher angiographic score (4.88 +/- 2.4 vs 2.2 +/- 1.2) (p less than 0.001), a lower ejection fraction (59 +/- 8.5 vs 65 +/- 7.5) (p less than 0.001), more multivessel and descending anterior artery lesion than the variable reserve group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
