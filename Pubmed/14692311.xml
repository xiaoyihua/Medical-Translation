<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In industrialized countries, most students are admitted to medical schools after obtaining a Bachelor degree. In 1993, the Catholic University of Chile instituted a program to obtain a Bachelor degree. These students can apply to Medical School. AIM To compare the academic achievement of students admitted to medical school directly from high school or after obtaining a Bachelor degree. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Cohorts of medical students coming directly from high school or after obtaining a Bachelor of Sciences degree, between 1997 and 2001, were studied. Social and demographic background, scores of the Academic Achieving test and grades obtained during high school and in medical school, were compared in both groups. RESULTS The distribution of gender and the region of origin were similar in both groups of students. Thirty two percent of bachelors and 18% of high school students admitted to medical school, came from public schools (p = 0.014). The Academic Achieving test score was 727 +/- 27 and 764 +/- 11 points in bachelor and high school students respectively (&lt; 0.001). However the mean grades in Medical School were similar in both groups of students. CONCLUSIONS Bachelor degrees are a good opportunity for students, that must be considered by Medical Schools in their admission systems.</dc:description>
