<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to describe acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with a substantial emotional component in spectators of professional league competition sports events. The study was done at the Barcelona soccer team's home stadium. We recorded cases of ACS that occurred during official competition matches during the 2000-2001 season. A total of 7 episodes of ACS were recorded, 1 involving sudden death, 4 involving acute myocardial infarction and 2 involving angina pectoris. The victim of sudden death had a history of heart disease. The overall risk of ACS was 0.0056 episodes per 100,000 person-hours. We conclude that medical facilities at the stadium facilitated the initial diagnosis of ACS and ensured prompt initial treatment and transport to the reference hospital.</dc:description>
