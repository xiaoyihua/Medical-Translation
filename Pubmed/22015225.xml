<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of pancreatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma in patients studied with MDCT during 2007 and to describe the patterns of presentation on MDCT. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively studied 133 patients with renal cell carcinoma who underwent MDCT between January and December 2007. Forty-nine patients presented disseminated disease. We analyzed the frequency, location, and patterns of presentation of pancreatic metastases. RESULTS Pancreatic involvement was identified in six patients. Four patients had isolated pancreatic nodules and two presented multiple nodules. A total of nine pancreatic lesions ranging between 8mm and 40 mm were detected. All nodules had increased uptake of contrast material in the arterial phase except for one in a patient with multiple nodules, due to necrosis. Two cases were associated with pancreatic duct dilation. Histology was obtained in only one patient. CONCLUSION Pancreatic involvement of renal cell carcinoma was detected in 4.5% of patients, ranking fifth in frequency in patients with disseminated disease. The arterial phase is necessary to detect pancreatic involvement of renal cell carcinoma. The pattern of presentation is nearly constant, helping differentiate pancreatic metastasis from primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma.</dc:description>
