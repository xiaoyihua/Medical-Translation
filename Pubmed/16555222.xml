<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) affects between 2 and 16% of children. It is a problem that sometimes has a very important effect on the whole family structure. Dealing with the problem in an inappropriate way, or simply interpreting it wrongly, entails a high risk of developing a conduct disorder in adolescence. DEVELOPMENT This paper reviews the concept of ODD and of conduct disorder, and highlights the theoretical foundations that underlie two types of behavioural intervention, namely, the behaviourist model and the cognitive model. Two programmes, each based on one of the two theoretical models, are described. The different pharmacological options that can facilitate the therapeutic process are also outlined. CONCLUSIONS Emphasis is placed on a therapeutic approach to ODD through psychological interventions based on guidelines designed to orientate the family and the school. This intervention cannot be founded on a general educational model, but rather it has to rest on knowledge of the dysfunctional cognitive characteristics of each child. In severe cases, the intervention must be complemented with the use of medication.</dc:description>
