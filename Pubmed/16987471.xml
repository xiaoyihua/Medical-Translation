<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hepatitis C virus infection is the principal cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the Western World. Chronic hepatitis C is often silent, most of the times discovered only by routine serologic or biochemical testing and the interval between infection and the development of cirrhosis exceed 30 years. Interestingly the complications of chronic hepatitis C virus infection can be prevented by antiviral therapy. At present, the combination of pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirina has become the standard treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The management of HCV infection in "special populations" (HIV coinfection and HCV therapy-experienced patient) has improved significantly over the past few years, through a better knowledge of the disease and the publication of several clinical trials performed in these patients. At presents, a number of new anti-HCV therapies are in development. Future drugs for HCV infection might make possible to eradicate HCV in future.</dc:description>
