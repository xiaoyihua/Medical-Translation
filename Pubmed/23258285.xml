<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Responding to an initiative advanced by the National Economic and Social Policy Council (CONPES, 3344/2005), this article presents the results of a research project concerned with environmental health in Colombian cities emphasising air pollution. METHOD The project was carried out between 2008 and 2009 for the Colombian Ministry of the Environment, Housing and Territorial Development using strategic environmental assessment (SEA) methodology contained in the complementary and decision-centred approach known as analytical strategic environmental assessment (ANSEA), relying on expert participation in different areas. RESULTS Five key issues were identified to base such policy on: urban planning, mobility and transport, industry and services, energy sources and risk management. Each theme was diagnosed regarding its current state from experts' knowledge and official information. CONCLUSIONS Such diagnosis led to a series of actions or interventions to be implemented at different levels by the state entities involved. Complementary recommendations were made for decision-making relating to the suggested interventions. Methodological guidelines were proposed for research into economic variables and the pertinent epidemiological surveillance.</dc:description>
