<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study is based on an analysis of the Semyu 112 nursing files which detected an elevated number of patients suffering pain while moved by our services; 16% of the cases registered this situation. Even though this percentage may seem low, it should be considered a high percentage if one bears in mind the therapeutic arsenal at our disposal and the advanced training we have received, as well as the suffering a patient experiences and the consequences this pain could have for vital functions. A large number of patients moved who suffered pain went untreated, and many others did not receive any analgesics but rather sedatives (neuro-surgical evaluations) blood vessel dilators, or other similar pharmaceuticals. Only 39.71% of patients who suffered pain were treated with analgesics which should make us reflect and look for improvements for this situation.</dc:description>
