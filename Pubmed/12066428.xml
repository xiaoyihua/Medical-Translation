<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Primary colon lymphomas (PCL) are very rare tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, and represent 0.2-0.5% of all colon primary tumors. They appear principally PCL in adult population. Almost all are non-Hodgkin's lymphomas; first however, one must discard lymph node origin. The most frequent sites of presentation are the cecum and rectum. Treatment of choice is surgical, plus adjuvant chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is reserved for specific cases. OBJECTIVE To inform on two cases of PCL. METHOD Review two of cases of cecum lymphomas and their treatment. RESULTS We inform the cases of two patients with the diagnosis of cecum lymphoma. The main patient complaints were abdominal pain, palpable mass, and hemorrhage. Both patients were treated with right extended hemicolectomy and ileum-transverse anastomosis. The outcome was unremarkable. Both patients received chemotherapy and remain free of disease at 1.5 and 5 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Primary colon lymphomas are very uncommon gastrointestinal tumors, with cecum localization as one of the most frequent sites of presentation in the colon. Treatment of choice must be surgical, with chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy to improve survival.</dc:description>
