<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To describe the patterns of requests for and the carrying out of the HIV test in Primary Health Care and the epidemological characteristics of the individuals who have undergone the test. METHOD A retrospective descriptive study of requests for the HIV test in Primary Health Care, in the area covered by the Sentinel Network of Castile and Leon between 1991 and 1996. The validity of the results was assured through an initial study of geographical representativity and populational diversity, with periodical adjustments. The information was obtained through weekly reports from Sentinel doctors. RESULTS The request rate per 100.000 inhabitants showed a tendency to increase until 1993, levelling off in 1995 and 1996. There were significant differences between percentage of test requested by doctors (55.9%) and patients (40%), as well as between males/females and average for age of these. Of the 63.1% of patients with known risk factor: 17.5% were injected drug users (IDUs) and 11.2% were through unsafe heterosexual contact; these factors being modified over time. The predominant risk factors among males were: heterosexual contact (31.1%) and the use of injected drugs (27.9%). The case was similar for females: 22.7% and 6.9% respectively. The results were positive in 3.2% of the HIV tests. CONCLUSIONS An increase in requests and tests carried out between 1991 and 1993 was detected. The figures later stabilized and, in general, they were lower than in other studies. The doctor was predominantly the origin of the request. A decrease in IDUs and an increase in the percentage of unsafe heterosexual contact, were detected, both in line with data from other research. Primary Health Care had a predominant place in early detection of risk practice and in the areas of prevention, education and information.</dc:description>
