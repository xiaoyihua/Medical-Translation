<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Advances in urological laparoscopy have increased the oncological safety of this approach for managing upper urinary tract tumours, although the open surgical route remains the method of choice. This article describes our experience of the laparoscopic approach over the past four years compared to open surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 1995 and 2009 a total of 95 nephroureterectomies were carried out to remove tumours: 70 by open surgery and 25 by laparoscopy. Lumbotomy with endoscopic detachment of the ureter was the most common approach in open surgery, while transperitoneal access was used for laparoscopy in all cases, with laparoscopic bladder cuff resection in most patients (56%). RESULTS The mean procedure time for open nephroureterectomies was 205 min (130-300), with a mean blood loss of 525 ml (100-1,800) involving 17 (24.2%) transfusions. The mean hospital stay was 8.4 days (3-30). The mean procedure time for the laparoscopic nephroureterectomies was 189 min (120-270), with a mean blood loss of 130 ml (100-400) and 4 (16%) transfusions. The mean hospital stay was 4.5 (2-28) days. CONCLUSIONS The patients who underwent the laparoscopic procedure had a lower transfusion rate and shorter hospital stay. Oncological control was similar for both approaches, although laparoscopy requires greater monitoring and a larger caseload.</dc:description>
