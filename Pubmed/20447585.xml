<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM A participatory action-research was conducted in an intensive care unit (ICU). A consensus was reached on four proposals for change regarding how to deal with the relatives of the critically ill patients, extending their visiting hours being one of these proposals. This study has aimed to ascertain the contributions of the unit professionals to a new proposal regarding visiting hours. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS The sample included 93 ICU professionals out of 205. A qualitative methodology study that included a two-item open survey was used: 1. Yes, I agree with the proposal (explain how you would improve it); 2. No, I do not agree with the proposal (explain why and how you would improve it). Content analysis and triangulation of researchers and participants were performed. The theoretical saturation point was reached. RESULTS Five categories emerged: 1) Modify the initial proposal; 2) Agreement with the proposal; 3) Doubts; 4) Barriers to implementation; 5) Flexibilization. CONCLUSIONS ICU professionals are reluctant to open their units, but accept the extension of current visiting hours. The physical structure of the unit is perceived as a major barrier.</dc:description>
