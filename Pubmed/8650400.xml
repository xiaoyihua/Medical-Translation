<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Although there have been many studies on the prognosis of congestive heart failure, most of them have not provided specific data about older patients. The aim of our study is to evaluate general characteristics and short and medium-term evolution of patients older than 65 years with severe heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS We have carried out a prospective study of all patients older than 65 years admitted to our Department during 1993 due to severe heart failure (functional class III or IV of the NYHA classification), regardless of the etiology. In that year, 84 patients who fulfilled those criteria were admitted. RESULTS The mean age was 72 +/- 6 years, 56% were male and 44% female. Age distribution was as follows: 36 patients were between 65 and 70 years, 27 between 70 and 75, 8 between 75 and 80, and 13 older than 80. The etiology of heart failure was: ischemic heart disease 44%, valvular heart disease 36%, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy 8%, systemic arterial hypertension 7% and other etiologies 5%. Significant systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 0.45) was present in 36% of the patients. Ten percent of the patients suffered from severe ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation). Regarding treatment, 24% underwent valvular surgery, 74% received only medical treatment and coronary angioplasty was performed in one patient. In hospital mortality was 9% (8 patients). After a mean follow-up of 8 +/- 4 months, the probability of survival was 78% at 1 month, 71% at 6 months and 63% at 1 year. The survival rate was better in patients with higher ejection fraction (53% for patients with ejection fractions of less than 0.45, 64% for those with ejection fractions between 0.45 and 0.60 and 79% for those with ejection fractions greater than 0.60). Considering etiology, the survival rate was worse for patients with acute myocardial infarction (30%) and aortic valve stenosis (58%). CONCLUSIONS Patients older than 65 years admitted to the hospital for severe congestive heart failure represent a heterogeneous population in respect to etiology, systolic function and prognosis. Nevertheless, from this study it appears that a worse prognosis was associated with the lower left ventricular ejection fractions and with certain etiologies; such as acute myocardial infarction or aortic stenosis.</dc:description>
