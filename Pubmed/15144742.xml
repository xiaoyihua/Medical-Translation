<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the mortality due to acute myocardial infarction in the coronary units from Comunidad Valenciana (Spain) and the prognostic factors associated with a higher mortality. PATIENTS AND METHOD Demographic characteristics, coronary risk factors, electrocardiographic ischemic signs, complications and mortality of patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted in the coronary units were collected. The study period comprised January 1995-December 1999. Death incidence was measured during coronary unit's stay. Factors associated with poor prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS 10.213 patients entered into the study. Mean age at admission was 65 12 years. 23.8% were females (76.2% males). Global mortality in coronary units was 13.3%. Independent variables associated with higher mortality were (p &lt; 0.05): advanced age (OR=1.06 [1.05-1.06]), female sex (OR=1.45 [1.26-1.66]), diabetes mellitus (OR=1.53 [1.35-1.74]), previous myocardial infarction (OR=1.46 [1.23-1.70]), previous angor pectoris (OR=1.29 [1.13-1.49]) and Q-wave infarction (OR=1.23 [1.03-1.43]). Factors associated with lower mortality were: hypercholesterolemia (OR=0.76 [0.66-0.78]), smoking (OR=0.65 [0.57-0.74]) and thrombolysis (OR=0.85 [0.78-0.92]). CONCLUSIONS At present, in the reperfusion therapy era, acute myocardial infarction has a high mortality after coronary unit admission. Several clinical factors are associated with a worse prognosis.</dc:description>
