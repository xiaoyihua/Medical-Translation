<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present a patient with a subacute asymmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy. The pathological features were predominantly loss of nerve fibers, axonal degeneration and healed vasculitis. The epineural vessels were involved, while endoneurial capillaires were preserved. Muscle biopsy revealed neurogenic features with normal blood vessels. After three years, motor and sensory function was almost normal, without any specific treatment. No abnormal findings suggesting collagen diseases or other underlying immunological disorders were obtained by various laboratory tests. In conclusion, the present case strongly suggests that the vasculitis was confined to the peripheral nerves.</dc:description>
