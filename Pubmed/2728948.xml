<dc:description xml:lang="en">We carried out a clinical and urodynamic assay of 100 cases of enuresis of a male population of ages ranging from 17 to 25. 64% displayed urodynamic alterations and these were significantly greater (p less than 0.005) amongst those suffering from nocturnal enuresis with diurnal symptoms (90%) than amongst those suffering from nocturnal enuresis only (59%). 36% of the patients did not display any urodynamic alteration. The urodynamic dysfunction most commonly displayed was vesical instability (46%). The other urodynamic dysfunctions found were 18% of the total, and detrusor contraction alteration constituted 10% of these (2 of the cases corresponded to vesical-urethral neurogenic dysfunction). The presence of minimum latent rachichisis was accompanied by urodynamic alterations in a significantly larger proportion (p less than 0.005) than in individuals not displaying this. The three case of wide-scale rachischisis were accompanied by urodynamic alterations corresponding to vesico-urethral neurogenic dysfunction. The case of secondary enuresis displayed neither urodynamic nor radiological alterations. Juvenile age enuresis displayed similar characteristics to infantile enuresis, although the percentage of vesical instability was lower. However, detrusor contraction alterations increased and the presence of previously non diagnosed vesico-urethral neurogenic dysfunctions was displayed.</dc:description>
