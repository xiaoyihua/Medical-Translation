<dc:description xml:lang="en">The safety data for adalimumab in psoriasis are similar to those described for other indications authorized for this drug. Most of the adverse effects observed (mainly, reaction at the injection point and upper respiratory tract infections) are of mild intensity and do not make it necessary to discontinue the drug. Serious adverse effects have been described in a low proportion of patients and include infections (tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections), lymphoproliferative conditions, autoimmune diseases and demyelinizing processes. Similar to other anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) treatments, the experience with adalimumab only provides information regarding its middle term safety. Thus, some years are needed to verify these results in the longer term. Due to this, the patients who are candidates for the drug must be correctly screened and they must be closely monitored during the treatment period and until 5 months after it.</dc:description>
