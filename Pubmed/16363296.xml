<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine what methods are habitually used by Spanish anesthesiologists to identify the epidural space. MATERIAL AND METHODS Spanish anesthesiologists were asked to fill in an Internet questionnaire about the methods they had learned during residency training for identifying the epidural space, the method they currently use most often, and the one they consider best for residents to learn during training. RESULTS Responses were received from 617 anesthesiologists. The techniques the respondents had learned during training were loss of resistance to air (LOR-A), 58.5%; LOR to saline (LOR-S), 31.9%; LOR and air bubble (LOR-B), 6.1%; and the hanging drop method, 2.4%. Those who had learned the LOR-A technique had changed in 14.2% of the cases, as had 28.4% of those who learned the LOR-S procedure. LOR-A is currently used by 59.2% of the respondents, LOR-S is used by 32.4%, and LOR-B by 6%. The respondents recommended that new residents physicians learn the LOR-A (48.5%) and LOR-S (37.8%) techniques. The LOR-B is recommended by 12.6% a much larger percentage of anesthesiologists than it is habitually used by. Of those who use the LORA technique habitually, 26.4% recommend that new residents use a different procedure. CONCLUSIONS The procedure used most often by Spanish anesthesiologists to identify the epidural space is the LOR-A technique; however, over a quarter of Spanish users of LOR-A do not recommend it.</dc:description>
