<dc:description xml:lang="en">Using data provided by the State Insurance Fund of Puerto Rico, the authors analyzed the risks related to their jobs of the employed female population changes over time and differences by sociodemographic characteristics and by sex. Rates of cases informed at the Fund were calculated and used as a "proxy" of risk. Results indicate that women have lower risks of health conditions associated with their employment than men. Younger and single women have higher risks than workers in the other age groups and marital statuses. Risks for women seem to be higher in those industries where they have just recently engaged and in those that demand skills which women lack. Rates of informed cases to the fund have decreased since the seventies for employed males, while for women they remained relatively stable in the seventies and decreased in the eighties.</dc:description>
