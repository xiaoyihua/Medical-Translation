OBJECTIVE To evaluate the allergenic extract pollen Cynodon dactylon (L) Pers elaborated at the reference hospital William Soler City Havana. MATERIAL AND METHODS We selected 100 patients of 18 to 50 years with a positive clinic history of inhalant allergy and 100 healthy person. All the persons selected were skin prick tested with dilutions of the extract (1:100 and 1:100 P/V) and positive and negative control. We measured the average diameter of the wheal and the perpendicular diameter, then we calculated the average. We also calculated size of the wheal in the duplicated, which constituted the size of the reaction. We estimated the validity of the test calculating the sensibility and specificity. We used the Epitable program to do this. RESULTS The skin prick tested positive in 81% of the patients and 11% in the healthy person, for sensitivity of 81% the interval of confidence 71.7, 87.9 (CI) and specificity of 89%, CI 80.8, 94.1; the predictive positive value 88.0%, IC 79.2, 93.6 and the predictive negative value 82.4%, IC 73.6, 88.8. CONCLUSIONS The allergenic extract of pollen Cynodon dactylon (L) Pers is very sharp to test allergy to its pollen produced by the allergology laboratory of Hospital William Soler, and is effective in diagnosing alterations caused by this pollen.</dc:description>
