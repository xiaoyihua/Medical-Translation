<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To know the prevalence of problem drinker in adult users of a health center, their personal features and the recording of alcohol consumption in the clinical record. DESIGN Descriptive crossover. SETTING Health Center of Deusto, Bilbao. PATIENTS 163 users, aged 14 to 65, obtained by systematic sampling. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS For data collection we used an inquest that included the MALT questionnaire. The population consisted of 44% of males and 56% of females. The prevalence of problem drinker was of 11 + 4.8% (CI 95%), made up of 6% of suspects and 5% of alcoholics. 19.4% of males and 4.4% of females was problem drinker (p = 0.002). Alcohol consumption was recorded in 35 + 8% (CI 95%); in 67% of problem drinker and in 31% of the remainder (p = 0.0014). Four out of 8 people self-considered as ex alcoholics were problem drinker. CONCLUSIONS Important problem in Primary Health Care with a prevalence similar to Spanish studies made with MALT. Alcohol consumption should be recorded in clinical records. It would be interesting to investigate the evolution of MALT in ex-alcoholics.</dc:description>
