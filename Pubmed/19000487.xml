<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Lifetime prognosis following successful repair of aortic coarctation can be affected by a number of late complications. The objective of this study was to assess left ventricular function in these patients and to identify factors that predispose to functional abnormalities. METHODS The study involved patients who had undergone repair of aortic coarctation and who had a pressure gradient pound 15 mmHg after repair and normal systemic blood pressure. Echocardiographic data collected before repair and the results of the most recent postoperative left ventricular function studies were analyzed. RESULTS The study involved 40 patients and 31 controls. Their mean age at repair was 6.9 years and the mean follow-up period was 4.25 years. During follow-up, the ejection fraction and the shortening fraction were observed to increase in 82.5% and 67.5% of patients, respectively. The myocardial performance index was abnormal in 47.5% of patients. The highest myocardial performance indices were observed in patients with arterial hypertension at diagnosis, in those who were aged over 4 years when they underwent repair, and in those with the most abnormal left ventricles before repair. CONCLUSIONS Measurement of the myocardial performance index showed that global left ventricular function was abnormal in 47.5% of patients after successful repair of aortic coarctation despite functional parameters being normal or elevated.</dc:description>
