<dc:description xml:lang="en">Data on nutrients and other food components are necessary in several sectors, such as nutrition, health, agriculture, trading and marketing. From the 17th century on, the systematic study of food composition started to be established. During the 19th century, there were many advances, such as the clarification of food energy production, the identification of nutrients and their physiologic role. Also, the first food composition tables began to emerge, finishing the century with the publication of Atwater and Wood's "The Chemical Composition of American Food Material" of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), in 1896. In the 20th century, the methods of analysis and the elaboration of food composition tables were improved in many countries. In 1984, INFOODS (International Network of Food Data Systems) was created. This network, linked to United Nations University (UNU) and Food and Agriculture Administration (FAO), proposed rules and created tools that brought great advances in food composition tables. Nowadays, the conscious related to food biodiversity has been amplifying the focus of food composition tables and databases. In Brazil, the Brazilian Food Composition Table (TBCA-USP), of the Brazilian Network for Food Composition Data (BRASILFOODS), since its creation in 1998, has been adopting these international patterns and is available on the Internet (http://www.fcf.usp.br/tabela), currently on the version 4.1.</dc:description>
