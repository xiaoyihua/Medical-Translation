<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of liraglutide monotherapy with glimepiride monotherapy in subjects with DM2 inadequately controlled by previous treatment of diet/exercise or oral antidiabetic drug. METHODS A 52-week, double-blinded, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre, prospective trial, involving 746 subjects was conducted in the USA and Mexico. In Mexico, 171 subjects were rando-mised (1:1:1) to once daily liraglutide (either 1.2, or 1.8 mg/day injected subcutaneously) or glimepiride (8 mg/day orally). RESULTS Hb1Ac reduced by 0.64%, 1.31% and 0.30% with glimepiride, liraglutide 1.8 mg and 1.2 mg, respectively. Body weight decreased with both liraglutide doses while a weight gain of 0.94 kg was observed with glimepiride. FPG reduced by 27.9 mg/dL with liraglutide 1.8 mg, whereas a FPG increase of 9.54 mg/dL was shown with glimepiride. No major hypoglycaemic episodes were reported in this trial. CONCLUSIONS in Mexican subjects with DM2, liraglutide monotherapy can provide greater reduction in HbA1c, weight loss and lower risk of hypoglycaemia in comparison with glimepiride.</dc:description>
