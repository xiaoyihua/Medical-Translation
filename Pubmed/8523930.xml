<dc:description xml:lang="en">Amebian hepatic abscess (AHA) is the most frequent extraintestinal localization of infection by Entamoeba histolytica. Despite being a disease mainly of tropical zones, it is currently also observed with higher frequency in Spain. Thirteen cases of AHA diagnosed in the authors' hospital over the last 11 years were retrospectively analyzed comparing the data in this series with that of other published series and undertaking a review of this subject. The diagnosis of AHA was established on the basis of the clinical picture together with specific positive serology and compatible echographic imaging. The series was composed of 9 males and 4 females with a mean age of 38.7 years (range 25-55). Five were Spanish, and 8 were immigrants from tropical countries. In 61.5% of the cases echographically guided aspiration puncture was performed with placement of percutaneous drainage being carried out in 38%. Eighty-five percent of patients were treated with more than one amebicide drug (metronidazole or tinidazole together with chloroquine and dehydroemetine). Luminal amebicides were administered lastly. Laparotomy was required in 3 cases due to the presence of complications. No deaths were observed.</dc:description>
