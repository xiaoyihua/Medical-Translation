<dc:description xml:lang="en">This article complements a previous one, in which theoretical concepts about etiologic categories, suspicion criteria and timely referral to the specialist were explained. This time we will focus on genetic counselling (GC), describing this process and its characteristics, in particular we will emphasize on psychiatry genetic counseling (PGC). PGC has particular characteristics considering the fact that there are still no tools (genetic testing) for diagnosis and that most mental pathologies are multifactorial inheritance disorders. This is complex, since it results from the interaction of genetics and environmental circumstances. Uncertainty is a given due to the number of factors involved in its appearance and, despite great strides, these should be further investigated. PGC seems to be a useful tool for both patients and families for better adapting to the disease and to cope with consequences derived from it. In conclusion, we consider of great importance to create an enabling collaborative workspace between psychiatrists and clinical geneticists in order to provide patients and their families a comprehensive approach to their problems.</dc:description>
