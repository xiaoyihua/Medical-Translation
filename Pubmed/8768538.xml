<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To study the level of concordance between the reactive strip, urine sediment and culture, and their sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. DESIGN Crossover study. SETTING Sotrondio and Laviana Health Centres, Asturias. PARTICIPANTS Diabetics of 14 or over included in the procedure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 165 analytical samples of blood and urine were studied. The variables were: age, sex, reactive strip (RS) of urine, sediment (S), binomial concordance of reactive strip-sediment (RS-S), culture (C) and metabolic control. The level of concordance between the variables was found through the Kappa index. Very high concordance was obtained in the RS-S and C comparisons (K = 0.49). The analysis of the variable RS-S displayed sensitivity of 66% and specificity of 87%. CONCLUSIONS Finding a low concordance between reactive strip, sediment and culture suggests their non-exclusive character. The importance of requesting urine sediment instead of the reactive strip for diabetics is indicated. Urine culture could well be included in the diabetic protocol.</dc:description>
