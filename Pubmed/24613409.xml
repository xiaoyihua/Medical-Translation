<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The objective of this study is to analyze the length of the longest period of previous abstinence time as a predictor of the results of a smoking cessation program at 12 months follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 475 smokers who had participated in a multi-component smoking cessation group therapy program. The independent variable is the longest abstinence time passed, measured in weeks, before the current treatment. Success was defined as self-reported abstinence. Bivariate analyses were applied to the independent variable and to other variables in order to determine the factors that would be part of a logistic regression model using contrasts Student t or χ(2) comparisons, as appropriate. Those that showed statistical significance were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS Within the studied variables, previous abstinence time and sex were the only predictive variables of success at 12 month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The probability of being abstinent at 12 months follow-up was significantly associated with the length of the previous longest period of abstinence, and this is the best of the predictors considered. Successful cessation programs depend more on the relationship with the consumer biographical aspects than with biological factors. The history of previous attempts is a more valuable source of information for designing treatments than others traditionally considered.</dc:description>
