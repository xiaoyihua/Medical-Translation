<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate orthostatic blood pressure response in patients with early Parkinson's disease and mild to moderate disease treated at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery. METHOD A cross-sectional study with control group was carried out. Patients with Parkinson's disease with a disease duration of less than 5 years and mild to moderate severity along with healthy controls of the same age group were included. Those subjects with diabetes mellitus, hypertension or diagnosis of dysautonomia were excluded. Blood pressure was measured in supine position as well as after 3 and 5 min of standing. RESULTS Seventy subjects with Parkinson's disease and 145 controls were included. There were no statistically significant differences in gender and age between both groups. There was no difference in systolic blood pressure change between groups at 3 minutes but at 5 minutes a statistically significant difference was found (P=.03). For diastolic blood pressure a difference between both groups was present at three and five minutes (P=.02 and P=.007). CONCLUSION Patients with early Parkinson's disease have differences in orthostatic responses compared to healthy controls, these differences are more relevant at 5 minutes of standing.</dc:description>
