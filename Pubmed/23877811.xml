<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis in communities located in 28 states of Mexico. MATERIALS AND METHODS The National Dental Caries Survey 2001 (NDCS2001) data base was analyzed. The information of 26,893 students, ages 12 and 15 years old, of 27 states and the Federal District was examined. Dean's dental fluorosis index was applied by standardized examiners. The fluorosis prevalence and the Community Fluorosis Index (FCI) were calculated. RESULTS The fluorosis prevalence was 27.9% (95% CI 24.4, 28.5). A statistical significance difference in the fluorosis prevalence was observed among the states studied (p &lt; 0.0001). The lowest prevalence was detected in Morelos (3.2%) and the highest in Durango (88.8%). In 18 (64.3%) of the states included more than 90% of the participants showed very mild or lower levels of the dental fluorosis index. A low level of the FCI was found in the localities belonging to 19 (67.9%) of the states studied (FCI &lt; 0.4). The lowest FCI was found in Colima, Yucatán and Morelos. The highest FCI were found in Durango, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes and San Luis Potosí (1 ≤ ICF). This information indicates that in these states dental fluorosis is a public health problem. CONCLUSIONS Two-thirds of the states had localities with low prevalence of dental fluorosis; however, approximately, one-third of the states investigated the fluorosis levels showed the need of a reduction in fluoride exposure among the young population.</dc:description>
