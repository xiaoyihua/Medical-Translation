<dc:description xml:lang="en">47 transesophageal echocardiograms (TEE) were performed on 43 patients (27 men and 20 women) in 30 months. The average age was 52.1 +/- 24.3 years. The most frequent indications for the procedure were: search for the source of emboli in 15 patients, suspected endocarditis and valvulopathies in 11. The main findings were intracavitary thrombi in 9 and vegetations in 8. The findings on TEE changed the medical management in 22 patients, confirmed suspected diagnosis in 15, and added nothing new in 10. Hypotension occurred in only one patient and resolved when the transducer was withdrawn. Comparing their results with those found in the literature the authors found that the indications were similar. TEE is an easy, safe and trustworthy study in selected patients.</dc:description>
