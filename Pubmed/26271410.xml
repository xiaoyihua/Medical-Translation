<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Teledermatology is a technique that is increasingly being developed. There are many studies that assess this discipline in the general population, but few studies analyse the paediatric population exclusively. The aims of this study are to describe the distribution of diseases consulted through teledermatology, the use of this technique to avoid face-to-face consultations, and the agreement between virtual and face-to-face diagnoses, in the paediatric population. MATERIAL AND METHODS The work consisted of an observational and retrospective study of the virtual consultations made between May 2011 and January 2015 through a store-and-forward teledermatology programme, involving patients from 0 to 15 years. We collected demographic data, as well as the diagnoses made by the paediatrician who made the virtual consultation, and by the dermatologists who assessed the virtual and the face-to-face consultations, the indication given by the dermatologist who assessed the virtual consultation (discharge or referral), reason for referral, and diagnostic agreement rate. RESULTS A total of 183 virtual consultations were analysed. The most frequent diagnoses were inflammatory diseases (39%), benign pigmented lesions (23%), and infectious diseases (20%). Almost half of the virtual consultations (48%) were referred for a face-to-face diagnosis. Diagnostic agreement between the dermatologist who evaluated the virtual consultation and the dermatologist who evaluated the face-to-face consultation was 89%, and 66% between the paediatrician who made the virtual consultation and the dermatologist who assessed it. CONCLUSIONS Virtual consultations have a similar disease distribution to conventional (face-to-face) referrals. Approximately half of the virtual consultations do not require a subsequent face-to-face visit. The agreement rate between the diagnoses given by both dermatologists (virtual and face-to-face diagnoses) is high.</dc:description>
