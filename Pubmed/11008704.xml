<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of the present study is to describe two cases of dogs with mucocutaneous lesions caused by Leishmania spp. Both dogs presented destruction of the nasal septum, hyperemia with soft palate edema and barking alteration due to laryngeal compromise. Biopsies were taken from the lesion border and Leishmania spp. amastigotes were seen in the imprints. The dogs presented positive serology when complex soluble antigen from Leishmania mexicana was used. One of the dogs was also suspected to be infected by Trypanosoma cruzi as suggested by its positive reaction with a purified specific antigen, Ag163B6-cruzipain. Most of the studies concerning leishmaniosis in dogs have described the cutaneous form of this disease in close association with human cases of Leishmania infection instead of the mucocutaneous form described herein. The presence of dogs with mucocutaneous leishmaniosis alerts on an increase of the prevalence of this form in humans, which can cause deforming lesions, alterations of the speech and even an inadequate nutrition due to difficulties in deglutition.</dc:description>
