<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present three patients developing pleural empyema after sclerotherapy of esophagic varixes. In all of them, the presence of persistent fever syndrome following the sclerotherapy, along with radiological images of pleural overflow, were the starting point of the patient's study. In the emergency esophagogrames, the extravasation of contrast outside the esophagus could not be confirmed. The treatment, which must be started as soon as possible, was based in conservative measures (drainage, antibiotics and a proper nutrition), given the poor general condition of these patients. Despite all these measures, the prognosis is poor, with two of the three patients dying despite the administration of the treatment. In conclusion, although its frequency is very low, pleural empiema is an extremely severe complication of the sclerotherapy of esophagic varixes. If this complication is suspected, the prognosis depends on a treatment that must be started as soon as possible.</dc:description>
