<dc:title xml:lang="en">Rotavirus infection in a period of 6 years (2007.2012): epidemiological considerations</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Introduction. Rotavirus is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children aged 5 years or under. The objective was to assess the incidence of nosocomial and community &#150;acquired rotavirus infections, and its epidemiological characteristics in 2007-2012. Methods. Stools specimens were collected form children with AGE&lt;5 years treated at the H.I.U Niño Jesús, Madrid, for the presence of rotavirus antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. A total of 4590 stools from patients with AGE were tested for rotavirus antigen. Rotavirus was detected in 709 patients (808 tools): 52% patients with community infections and 48% with nosocomial infections. Of these rotavirus nosocomial AGE, 12% were immunocompromised children. The number of patients with rotavirus in 2007-2012 was 124 (18%), 98 (14%), 83 (12%), 138 (20%), 173 (24%) and 93 (14%), respectively. Eighty-six percent of the patients with rotavirus AGE were &amp;#8804;1 year of age. Rotavirus and adenovirus (65%) were the association most frequently detected. Conclusions. There are a high rate of nosocomial infection and changes in the seasonal pattern. From a marked seasonality in 2007, the pattern became irregular in 2008-2012. This change indicates a viral transmission more sustained which  might reduce the efficiency of prevention measures (AU)</dc:description>
