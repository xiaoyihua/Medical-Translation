<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report the symptoms and analytical findings observed in the collective of patients affected with the toxic oil syndrome (TOS) 18 years after the poisoning. METHODS At the Centro de Investigación sobre el Síndrome del Aceite Tóxico (CISAT) we followed the clinical and analytical course of 758 patients affected with the TOS since December 1997 up to May 1999. Patients were evaluated by means of a previously standardized questionnaire in which a clinical review and a battery of complementary tests (thyroid hormones, spirometry with diffusion test and arterial gasometry) were included. One hundred and sixty-two patients underwent also echocardiogram because of presumptive pulmonary hypertension and/or heart disease. RESULTS Out of the 758 patients, 516 were females and 242 males (M:F ratio 2:1), with ages ranging from 17 to 84 years (mean age 47 years). One of the most remarkable findings was the increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors: arterial hypertension (34%), dyslipemias (44%), overweight (40%), obesity (27%), carbohydrate intolerance (9%) and diabetes mellitus (9.4%). The most common reported symptoms were: cramps (78%), arthralgias (78%), and paresthesias (70%). Only 2.8% of patients reported to be asymptomatic. The analytical results most commonly changed were: changes in lipidic and carbohydrate metabolism (already reported), overt or subclinical hypothyroidism (6.6%) and respiratory changes in patients with no previous pulmonary disease: changes in spirometry (6%), diffusion test (8%) and hypoxemia (18%). Echocardiographic findings suggestive of PHT were obtained in 3.1% of cases. CONCLUSIONS Although TOS occurred in 1981, this syndrome still has a relevant morbidity in a portion of the spanish population. To remark the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors with changes in lipidic and carbohydrate metabolism and subclinical hypothyroidism observed in our series. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the actual dimension of this poisoning.</dc:description>
