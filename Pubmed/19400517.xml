<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in cervicovaginal lavage has proved useful in establishing the diagnosis of premature rupture of membranes, but the methods used for determining time-consuming. OBJECTIVE To qualitatively determine the concentration of hCG in cervicovaginal lavage to establish the diagnosis of premature rupture of membranes. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospective observational study conducted in 149 pregnant women divided into three groups: group I (n = 50), patients with premature rupture of membranes, group II, with suspected ruptured membranes and group III, with premature rupture of membranes confirmed. The diagnosis was established by clinical examination and testing nitrazina and crystallography. In all patients was conducted and cervicovaginal lavage fluid obtained hCG was determined with a rapid qualitative test (sensitivity 25 mlU/mL). We calculated the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value of the method. RESULTS The mean gestational age was 34.6 +/- 5.2 weeks. In 8.7% of the cases were considered "inconclusive" qualitative hCG test, so only 136 samples were analyzed. The sensitivity was 95.6%, specificity 100%, the positive predictive value of 100% and negative 97.8%. CONCLUSION The qualitative determination of hCG in cervicovaginal lavage is useful for establishing the diagnosis of premature rupture of membranes.</dc:description>
