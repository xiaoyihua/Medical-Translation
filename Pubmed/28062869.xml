<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to report the initial experience of the combined use of biliary sphincterotomy plus balloon dilatation of the papilla for management of large stones. MATERIALS AND METHODS Design: Retrospective, descriptive. This study included 18 patients in whom a hydrostatic dilatation of the papilla with large balloons was performed between June 2012 and April 2014. Patients had multiple large stones, tapered distal common bile duct, previous sphincterotomy, or peri/ intradiverticular papilla. CRE™ dilatation balloons with diameters ranging from 12 to 20 mm were used. Data were recorded as successful procedure, use of lithotripsy and complications during the procedure. RESULTS The average age was 66.1 years. There was a predominance of the female gender (66.7%). The average size of the bile duct stones was 16.7 mm. The main indications were: giant choledocholithiasis (12 patients, 66.7%) and tapered distal common bile duct (6 patients, 33.3%). The dilatation balloons diameter used were: 15 mm (8 patients, 44.4%), 18 mm (5 patients, 27.8%), 12 mm (3 patients, 16.7%) and 20 mm (2 patients, 11.1%). Complete stone clearance was achieved in 15 patients (83.3%). Lithotripsy was performed in 4 patients (22.2%). There were 3 patients in whom the removal with balloon was unsuccessful, performed surgical management. It was reported 1 case of mild acute pancreatitis (5.5%). CONCLUSIONS The results show that endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation after sphincterotomy is a safe and effective technique for treatment of difficult bile duct stones.</dc:description>
