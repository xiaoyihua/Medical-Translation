<dc:description xml:lang="en">Research carried out on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection illustrates the speed in the transfer of knowledge obtained from basic research to the treatment of patients. Due to studying the viral life cycle and structure and function of HIV proteins, there are currently more than 20 drugs available to treat infected patients. In this article a review is carried out on the biological cycle of HIV, highlighting those steps that represent preferential targets for pharmacological intervention. In the second part of the article, the characteristics of the main antiretroviral families that form the basis of classic antiretroviral treatment are summarised as well as reviewing the recently introduced drugs which are directed at new targets. Finally, an assessment is made of the new prototypes that are in the pre-clinical development phase and which will strengthen the future therapeutic arsenal against HIV infection.</dc:description>
