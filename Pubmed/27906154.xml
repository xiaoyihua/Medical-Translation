<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Childhood overweight and obesity have increased progressively in the last decades, especially in countries of Southern Europe. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of overweight, obesity and its determinants in schoolchildren between 8-9 years old from Barcelona. METHODS Cross-sectional study of a representative sample of 3,262 schoolchildren in 2011. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated following the criteria established by the World Health Organization (z-scores). Variables on eating behaviour, physical activity and use of new technologies were studied through 2 questionnaires. Logistic regression models were adjusted, obtaining adjusted odds ratio and their confidence intervals (95%). RESULTS The prevalence of overweight was 24.0% and 12.7% for obesity. Obesity was significantly higher in boys than in girls (14.8% vs 10.8%.). No statistically significant differences were observed in the compliance of recommendations of physical activity practice and use of new technologies according to BMI. Factors associated with obesity in boys were to attend a school located in a neighbourhood of disadvantaged socio-economic status [ORa=1.88 (1.35-2.63)], to belong to an immigrant family [ORa=1.57 (1.12-2.20)], to do not eat at school [ORa=1.76 (1.20-2.59)] and to have some meal alone [ORa=1.95 (1.27-3.00)]. In girls associated factors were to belong to a single-parent family [ORa=1.58 (1.06-2.34)] and to an immigrant family [ORa=1.53 (1.07-2.18)]. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of childhood obesity in Barcelona is high. It is more common in boys, being the social determinants most relevant associated factors.</dc:description>
