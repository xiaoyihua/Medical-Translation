<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The liver is the organ in which often metastasize primary tumors. Knowledge of the etiology and forms of presentation of metastatic disease is key to deciding on the different treatment options. OBJECTIVE Describe the surgical management of liver metastases in colorectal cancer and factors that affect the survival of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed 43 cases of patients with metastatic liver cancer of the colon or rectum, who underwent liver surgery, attended January 1990 to December 2007. We analyzed demographic variables and perioperative associated with the survival of patients. There was the course and type of postoperative complications as well as the direct causes of mortality. RESULTS Were conducted mostly metastasectomies (n = 25), followed by right hepatectomy (n = 9),and left hepatectomy (n = 9). Surgical mortality was 4.6% (n = 2). The survival rate at 1, 3 and 5 year were 45% (18 patients), 42.5% (18 patients)and 12.5% (5 patients), respectively. The presence of a single metastatic lesion (p = 0.006), size of the lesion larger than 5 cm (p = 0.003), positive lymph nodes (p = 0.002), synchronous tumor (p = 0.04),presence of extra hepatic disease (p = 0.01), positive margin (p = 0.001) and blood loss &gt;2000 mL were significantly associated with a lower survival rate. CONCLUSION After hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer the presence of more than one tumor, &gt; of 5 cm, with presence of synchronous tumor, nodes and positive margins, extra hepatic disease, as well blood loss &gt; 2000 mL are factors associated with a worse survival.</dc:description>
