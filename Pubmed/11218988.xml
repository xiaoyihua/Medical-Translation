<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE We have carried out a study to evaluate diagnostic usefulness of ultrasound in Morton's neuroma. METHODS Twenty five patients with symptoms suggestive of Morton's neuroma underwent ultrasound examination of the forefoot. All patients subsequently had surgical treatment. RESULTS Nineteen patients had sonographic evidence of neuroma which were confirmed surgically and later by histological exams. One patient had sonographic evidence of a neuroma that was not confirmed surgically. The remaining five patients did not have sonographic or surgical evidence of neuroma in spite of clinical signs and symptoms. No adjacent neuromas were appreciated. Ultrasound accurately predicted the location of the neuroma in 96.7%. Ultrasound demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 83.3%. CONCLUSION We conclude that ultrasound is a highly accurate technique in the diagnosis of the presence and location of Morton's neuromas.</dc:description>
