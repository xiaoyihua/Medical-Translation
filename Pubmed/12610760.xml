<dc:description xml:lang="en">Catatonia is a large neuropsychiatric syndrome with multiple etiologies (psychiatric disorder, cerebral structural lesion, systemic disease, secondary to drugs and toxic agents) and varied clinical manifestations (cognitive and behavioral disorders, motor and speech disorders and vegetative disorders). The presence of disautonomy means a situation having vital risk, that requires immediate therapeutic intervention. A 22 year old woman was admitted due to a picture of stupor, fever, maintained postures, rigidity, seizures and tachycardia and hypertension episodes; this picture initiated four weeks earlier, with psychotic and affective symptoms and she slowly developed speech and motor activity impairment. Initially, she had been treated with neuroleptics, anticholinergics and antidepressants. The CT, MRI and CSF studies were normal. The EEG revealed diffuse slow waves and right frontotemporal paroxystic activity Laboratory determinations showed elevation of CK, coinciding with the vegetative disorder phase. The picture resolved progressively in two months, after receiving 19 sessions of electroshock therapy. In all the patients, and above all in those who receive neuroleptics, with symptoms suggesting catatonia, the presence of disautonomy should be considered as an alarm situation, which would make it necessary to discontinue the neuroleptics and to adopt special control. Electroshock therapy is the most effective therapeutic option in the situation of malignant catatonia.</dc:description>
