<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Intimacy is one of the most common and less cared for aspects in health care. From real situations from diagnostic explorations to hospitalisation, the patient possibly sees him/herself subjected to constant aggression of the integrity of his values. When this is noted and taken into account by professionals and especially by the nurses, using various strategies implicit in the care given them, it proves to be one of the elements of major satisfaction and confidence shown in our clients. OBJECTIVES To identify the characteristics associated with the concept of intimacy from a global perspective; that is, from a patient point of view, and from that of the nursing professionals themselves. MATERIAL AND METHOD This was a qualitative study using a consensusof focal groups opinion, directed towards patients (and/or principal carers) admitted to the Nursing Service Unit of the Neurology Service of our hospital and a group of professionals in the same service. RESULTS We have been able to verify that the opinion of professionals and patients coincide in some aspects leaving other exposed to expand our perspective with respect to the welfare offering that we do in order to improving it. CONCLUSIONS This methodology for improved care puts a global focus on the approach to intimacy and attempts to show the connection between the care provided, the perceived quality of this, and the expectations of our clients.</dc:description>
