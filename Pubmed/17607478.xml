<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper is to present findings from the GYTS on current cigarette smoking and other tobacco epidemic indicators. MATERIAL AND METHODS The GYTS uses a two-stage cluster sample survey design that produces representative samples of students aged 12 to 15 years enrolled in public, private and technical schools. The survey was undertaken in 2003 and 2006 at 399 schools in nine cities. The GYTS surveyed 33 297 students. Point prevalence, differences of proportions and adjusted odds ratio were estimated. RESULTS The overall rate for current smoking in 30 days preceding the survey is 24.9% (95% CI, 22.5-27.3). Among never smokers, 28% are likely to initiate smoking next year. As compared to the previous survey in 2003, there is not a reduction in cigarette smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke. Cessation rates have not changed and advertisements and access by minors to tobacco products are still unresolved problems. However, tobacco related materials have significantly been added to school curricula. National estimates are presented, as well as city level estimates. CONCLUSION Two years after FCTC ratification, there is no major improvement in critical areas of tobacco control in Mexico; particularly, there is no evidence of reduction in cigarette smoking among students in secondary schools.</dc:description>
