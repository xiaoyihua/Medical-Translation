<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Retroclival posttraumatic hematomas are extremely rare and almost exclusive to childhood. Only one case of retroclival subdural hematoma has been reported in the literature to date. CASE REPORT An 8-year-old boy suffered a severe head injury with cervical hyperextension as the result of a bicycle accident. On admission his initial Glasgow Coma Score was 13 and he had diplopia due to right palsy of the VI nerve. A retroclival subdural hematoma was observed by CT and MRI of the craneovertebral junction. Management was conservative and a rigid collar was placed. Palsy of VI nerve recovered spontaneously at 6 days and at discharge the patient had only cervical pain. Follow up at 3 months after the accident showed clinical and radiological resolution. CONCLUSION Traumatic retroclival hematomas are mainly a pediatric entity due to immaturity of the cranio-cervical junction. Treatment consists of placement of a rigid collar although clinical progression may require surgical evacuation.</dc:description>
