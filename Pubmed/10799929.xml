<dc:description xml:lang="en">The protocol developed at our hospital for auditory assessment of children with risk factors for deafness is presented. The results obtained with tympanometry and auditory brainstem response (ABR) audiometry from October 1994 to March 1998 were analyzed. In 122 children, 17 cases (14%) of severe-to-profound bilateral deafness were found. Only 50% of these cases were associated with risk factors present at birth. The average age at time of diagnosis of deafness was over 3 years. In view of these results, we recommend auditory screening for all newborns as the only effective procedure for early detection of childhood deafness.</dc:description>
