<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The detection of hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra using trans cranial sonography can be predictive of the diagnosis of Parkinson Disease. AIM To report an experience with transcranial sonography for the diagnosis of Parkinson disease. Material ana METHODS One hundred sixteen patients with movement disorders were subjected to a transcranial sonography to detect the presence of hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra and basal ganglia. Afterwards, two physicians, unaware of the results oft he sonography, examined the patients and reached a clinical diagnosis. The concordance between ultrasound results and the clinical diagnosis was analyzed. RESULTS In 64 patients, a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease was reached. Of these, 52 patients had substantia nigra hyperechogenicity and in 12, it was normal. On the other hand ultrasound was normal in 42 of 43 patients without a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease. Therefore the sensitivity and specificity of trans cranial ultrasound for the diagnosis of Parkinson disease was 81 and 97%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Transcranial sonography has a good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of Parkinson disease.</dc:description>
