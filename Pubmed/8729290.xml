<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this paper was to obtain information about sexual behavior of university students. To achieve this goal we implemented a survey which was answered anonymously by 438 students, 123 women and 315 men. They were divided into three age groups. Between women, sexual activity grew with age, but between men, on the contrary, the highest percentage was verified in the youngest age group. The age at which sexual activity was started decreased in one year each four years of age and is two years ahead in boys. Reasons stated for this decision by women were based on values and love, while pleasure and opportunity were appointed by men. Both men and women of all ages showed a high number of sexual partners. Sexual transmitted diseases were acknowledged by a high number of students. This results clearly show the necessity of an educational programme including sexual advisory and sexual transmitted diseases prevention in all health care actions designed for university students.</dc:description>
