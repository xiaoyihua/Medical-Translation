<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION dengue is an infectious disease caused by ARN genome virus and has 4 recognized serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4) that are transmitted by Aedes aegypti as the main vector. The clinical manifestations of dengue in pregnancy are similar to those of the general population, except that the ecosystem is made up by the mother and the fetus where the virus with its genetic characteristics is introduced and finds special conditions for development and evolution. OBJECTIVE to study the progression of the dengue symptoms in women who got sick during their pregnancy for one year of follow-up. METHODS an observational descriptive research was conducted to find out the existence of sequelae in women who were infected with dengue 3 during their pregnancy. A cohort of 28 pregnant women, who had been admitted to "Juan Bruno Zayas Alfonso" General Hospital at the time of the dengue outbreak from April to November 2006, was studied. The diagnosis was serologically confirmed. RESULTS after one-year of follow-up, it was observed that amnesia (25 %) and menstrual disorders (14.3%) affected these women. Amnesia was significant when the infection occurred in the third trimester of pregnancy, p=0.0377. CONCLUSIONS dengue 3 infection may cause amnesia in pregnant women who suffered this disease, particularly in their third trimester of pregnancy.</dc:description>
