<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report the infectious complications and presentation time of the first 120 consecutive liver transplants performed at our institution. METHODS Prospective study of infectious complications among 120 consecutive adult patients who received orthotopic liver transplantation at Hospital de Cruces, from February 1996 to November 1998. Two patients received a renal transplant concomitantly. The same surveillance protocols were used for all patients and the criteria used to define infections were those reported by other authors. RESULTS The group consisted of 120 patients, 95 males and 25 females. The age ranged from 20 and 66 years (mean: 54 +/- 9 years). The indications for transplantation included alcoholic cirrhosis (47%), HCV cirrhosis (20%), hepatocellular carcinoma (17.5%), fulminant hepatitis (6%), primary biliary cirrhosis (2.5%) and miscellaneous conditions (7%). Three patients required retransplantation. Acute rejection was histologically diagnosed in 38 patients (31%). None of the patients had corticosteroid-resistant rejection. Fifty-one patients (42.5%) developed 76 episodes of severe infection, which included: 48 episodes of bacterial infection among 33 patients (27.5%), tuberculosis in 7 patients (6%), 9 episodes of fungal infection among 8 patients (7%) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection among 8.5% of patients. No patient developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Fifteen (12.5%) patients died: six (12.5%) with active infection, and in four of them the infection was considered the cause of death. CONCLUSIONS Infection rates due to bacteria and fungi were similar to those reported in the literature. A high rate of tuberculosis was found, which possible correlated with the high incidence of this disease in the general population. The low incidence of CMV infection was probably due to the preemptive therapy with gancyclovir. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii was highly effective.</dc:description>
