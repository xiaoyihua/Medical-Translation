<dc:description xml:lang="en">A training program for secondary school teachers, by the name of Stress inoculation, is presented. It is aimed at coping with conflictive situations likely to arise in a classroom. Adapted from D. Menchembaum's model, this program has been developed, and assessed at three secondary schools of the city of Buenos Aires: It is the author's contention that it lives up to her expectations. Teachers are trained to develop resources enabling them to: (a) recognize alarm signals arising in their relationships with students (i.e., signals advising that such relationships are in jeopardy), (b) cut sequences leading initial situations to burst out in violent behavior, and (c) incorporate coping alternatives when facing violent situations so that both teaching, and teacher-students relationship are preserved--as well as teacher's and students' mental health.</dc:description>
