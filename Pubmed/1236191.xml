<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors review the case histories in twenty patients with traumatic rupture of the diaphragm seen and surgically treated during the last eight years at the Central Hospital of the Mexican Red Cross. Automobile accidents were the most frequent cause and the diagnosis was made on the basis of the clinical history and X-ray examinations. In some patients the lesion is not incapacitating and may remain unrecognized for many years. The left hemidiaphragm is more frequently involved. The usual surgical approach employed was, first, anterior thoracic; second, abdominal-thoracic and third; abdominal. Among the secondary thoracic and abdominal lesions those affecting the liver were the most frequent. The stomach was the organ which most frequently had to be resected. Eight patients died and in seven the cause of death could be attributed to the secondary lesions.</dc:description>
