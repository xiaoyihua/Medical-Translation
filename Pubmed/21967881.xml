<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The authors summarize the findings of the Spanish Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Registry for 2010 compiled by the Spanish Society of Cardiology Working Group on Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators. METHODS Members of the Spanish Society of Cardiology were prospectively surveyed; data were recorded voluntarily by each implantation team on one-page questionnaires. RESULTS In total, 4627 device implantations were reported, comprising 85.6% of the overall estimated number of implantations. The reported implantation rate was 100.61 per million population and the estimated total implantation rate was 117.50 per million. The proportion of first implantations was 73.87%. We collected data from 143 hospitals (9 more than in 2009). The majority of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantations were performed in men (81%). The mean age was 62.5 ± 13 years. Most of the patients had severe or moderate-to-severe ventricular dysfunction and were in New York Heart Association functional class II. Ischemic heart disease was the most frequent underlying cardiac condition, followed by dilated cardiomyopathy. The number of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantations indicated for primary prevention increased over the previous year and now accounts for 65.6% of first implantations. In all, 76.1% of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantations were performed by cardiac electrophysiologists. CONCLUSIONS The 2010 Spanish Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Registry includes data on almost 86% of all the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantations performed in Spain. Although the number has continued to increase, it still remains far lower than the European average. There has been a significant increase in the number of implantations indicated for primary prevention.</dc:description>
