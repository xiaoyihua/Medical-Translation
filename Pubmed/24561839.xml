<dc:description xml:lang="en">Takotsubo Syndrome is an acquired cardiomyopathy characterized by a transient left ventricular antero-apical asynergy or disynergy (apical ballooning), symptoms and electrocardiographic changes are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, moderate cardiac enzymatic release and absence of significant atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries. It predominantly affects postmenopausal women and it is frequently preceded by situations of physical or psychological stress. The physiopathology is not completely understood but there is consensus that it is triggered by a surge of catecholamines consequent to the aforementioned stress conditions. The study of 32 cases diagnosed at three medical institutions in Córdoba, Argentina, is reported. The mean age was 61 years, and 28 were female. All cases simulated acute coronary syndromes. Congestive heart failure developed in twelve cases (37.5%) and two patients (6.3%) developed cardiogenic shock. The left ventricular function normalized more rapidly than the electrocardiographic changes. The recurrence rate was 25%, the prognosis was benign considering that only one death occurred following a relapse. In general the findings are similar to previously published studies. Recent advances in the comprehension of the physiopathology of this cardiomyopathy gave way to the development of a rational therapeutic approach.</dc:description>
