<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study was carried out at the of gastroenterology service from Hospital Nacional "Daniel A. Carrión" Callao-Peru, between June 1993 and May 1994, in order to determine the incidence, as well as, the clinical and endoscopic features of peptic ulcer disease in cirrhotic patients. 24 out of 46 (52.17%) hospitalized cirrhotic patient during this period, had peptic ulcer disease. The male:female ratio was 1:1. The mean age was 63.54 years, ranging from 44 to 90. There was statistical association (p &lt; 0.05) between the severity of liver disease determined by Child Pugh Score and the presence of gastric ulcer. Regarding symptomatology, 54.16% had hematemesis and/or melena and 37.5% were asymptomatic. 6 patients had 2 or more ulcers, presenting the total series as a whole 35 ulcers, whose size ranged from 0.4 a 1.2 cm. Gastric antrum was the most often location (60%) followed by duodenal bulb (20%). We conclude that peptic ulcer disease in our cirrhotic patients is more frequent than reported by international literature (5-32%). Severity of liver disease was associated to gastric ulcer.</dc:description>
