<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the degree of activity in the field of secondary prevention of alcohol and/or drug abuse in trauma patients in Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS We surveyed 76 hospitals located in all the autonomous regions of Spain. We collected information about the number of severe trauma patients admitted to the ICU per year, the detection of alcohol and drugs in these patients, and the activity for secondary prevention through motivational intervention among other approaches. RESULTS Of the 76 hospitals surveyed, 66 responded and only one carried out any secondary prevention activity through motivational intervention. Most of the hospitals surveyed (64.5%, 40/62) did not know of the possibility of secondary prevention through motivational intervention and (29%, 18/62) did not have the resources to carry it out. Asked whether they screened trauma patients for drugs and/or alcohol, 15.6% of centers responded "always" 37.5% (24/64) "usually", and 40.6% only "sometimes". CONCLUSION Most centers surveyed are unaware of the usefulness of secondary prevention in trauma patients. This lack of awareness may be responsible for the lack of activity in this field in Spain. A plan to increase awareness, including educational interventions, is necessary to promote secondary prevention of alcohol and drug abuse among trauma patients.</dc:description>
