<dc:description xml:lang="en">Due to the lack of specificity of the clinical picture in the right-sided infective endocarditis, the correct diagnosis is rarely made. We reviewed 30 cases with right-sided or right and left infective endocarditis, treated in the INC from 1946 to 1982. The average age was 20 years. Rheumatic fever (53%), congenital heart disease (40%) and cardiac prostheses (7%) were the more common underlying diseases. The diagnosis was made on an average 7.3 months after the first symptom. Heart failure (93%), fever (76%), weight loss (73%), haemoptysis (66%) and general malaise (53%) were the predominant symptoms. There was no diagnostic suspicion in 9 patients (30%) and in 7 from 16 with negative blood culture, the infection was exclusively right-sided. Peripheral and pulmonary embolism was the most frequent complication. (66%) There were 29 deaths (96.6%). In all of them the diagnosis was confirmed in the postmortem examination. Heart failure and septic shock were the main causes of death. Almost all patients were infected with gram-negative germs and staphylococcus Aureus. This diagnosis should be suspected in a patient with known heart disease, who develops unexplained heart failure, moreover if pulmonary emboli are a feature. The diversity of the isolated germs is different from other publication that have shown staphylococcus as the most prevalent microorganism. This difference can be explained by the lack of drug abuse in our cases. The mortality rate is higher than in the left sided endocarditis.</dc:description>
