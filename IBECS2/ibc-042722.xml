<dc:description xml:lang="es">The most common postoperative complications of total gastrectomyare esophagojejunal anastomotic leakage and subphrenicabscess. These complications are a cause of morbilityand mortality, relaparotomy, and longer postoperative stay. Theuse of abdominal drains is useful for the early diagnosis andmanagement of anastomotic leaks. The aim of this study was toanalyze our experience with total gastrectomy for gastric cancerin patients with and without abdominal drains, and to evaluatethe results regarding postoperative morbidity, postoperativehospital stay, postoperative days for oral intake, relapatorotomyand mortality. This prospective and randomized study examinesthe results in 60 consecutive patients (43 males and 17 females)with gastric cancer who underwent total gastrectomy in the RegionalClinical Hospital of Concepción, Chile, between 2000and 2003. Patients were divided into two groups: group I (withoutdrains) and group II (two drains). We found 31 patients ingroup I and 29 patients in group II. The mean length of postoperativestay was 12.9 days in group I and 18.8 days in group II(p = 0.0242, s.). Morbidity was 9.7% in group I and 37.9% ingroup II (p = 0.0242, s.). Re-explorations were more frequent ingroup II (24.1%) versus group I (9.7%) (p = 0.1239, n.s.). Postoperativedays for oral intake were 9.4 in group I and 12.8 ingroup II (p = 0.0514, n.s.) Mortality was 0% in group I and3.4% in group II (p = 0.4833, n.s.). In our experience, morbidityand postoperative hospital stay were statistically higher in thegroup of patients with abdominal drains</dc:description>
