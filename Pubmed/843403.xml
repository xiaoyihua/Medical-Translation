<dc:description xml:lang="en">The author reports the case of a 10 years old female child with history of retrocecal appendicular abscess complicated with terminal ileum and right colon necroses which called for partial ileocoletomy. Following this operation, the patient presented diarrhea which caused a loss in weight of 6 kgs. in two months. Antiacids and diphenoxylate were given with negative results. A low fat diet was then given and the patient recovered 1 kg. in weight, but the diarrhea persisted with high excretion of fats. Thereupon, cholestyramine and a normal diet were given followed, within the next 48 hours, by a remission of the diarrhea; the weight loss was recovered within the next 3 months. At present, the patient is still taking very small doses of cholestyramine with a normal diet.</dc:description>
