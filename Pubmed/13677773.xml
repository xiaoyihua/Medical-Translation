<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since the introduction of the modern techniques for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the 1960s, professionals have discussed the need to standardize its application and teaching both among health care professionals and the general public. The "ILCOR", Committee to Coordinate Resuscitation Techniques, in an effort to simplify resuscitation techniques, set out some recommendations in August 2000 which were adopted by the leading organizations such as AHA and ERC, in charge of diffusing Vital Suport techniques. In these, different levels of attention have been incorporated depending on the qualifications which the person has who is provide this treatment. The most important changes are the necessity to put Emergency Medical Services into action rapidly; the techniques to follow if there are one or two persons apply resuscitation techniques; for artificial resuscition emergency care, new volumes depending on the use or non-use of oxygen; the acceptance of devices to open up alternate air passageways; recommendations whether or not it is pertinent to check on a patient's pulse depending on the qualifications of the person attending that patient; heart message techniques exterpulmonary resuscition woth only thorax compression and automatic external defibrillation.</dc:description>
