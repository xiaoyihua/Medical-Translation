<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE We summarize our experience of endoscopic treatment of gastrointestinal fistulas with fibrin glue. PATIENTS AND METHOD We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of 30 patients with gastrointestinal fistulas (9 internal and 21 external) refractory to standard conservative treatment for at least 10 days. Once the fistula was endoscopically located, 4 to 8 ml of reconstituted fibrin glue (Tissucol 2.0) at 37 degrees C was injected through a Duplocath catheter on a weekly basis. RESULTS The mean age was 59 years (32-87) and 63% were men. A total of 21.9% of the patients had high output fistulas. We were able to find all fistular orifices what were located close to the surgical anastomosis. Healing time was 17 days (4-90); 2.8 sessions were required per patient (1-5) but only 2.3 sessions were required in responders. Complete sealing of fistulas was achieved in 75%; (80% in low-output, 25% in high-output and 55.5% in internal fistulas). The frequency of fistula recurrence was 3.3%. No complications related to the sealing procedure were found. Overall mortality was 10%, but only 6.6% was related to persistence of the fistula. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic treatment of fistulas with biological glue has a high success rate in sealing without complications, helping to speed up the healing process and reduce costs, particularly in low-output enterocutaneous fistulas.</dc:description>
