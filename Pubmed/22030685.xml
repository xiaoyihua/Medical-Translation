<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Ascertaining the presence of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in raw milk from cows grazing on traditional cotton farms in San Pedro, Sucre, Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS 48 samples were taken from three cattle farms; two of them used cotton seed and soca dietary supplement.OCP concentration was determined by gas chromatography (GC) using an electron capturedetector (µ-ECD). RESULTS 100 % of the samples had some type of OCPs and Endrin, DDT and Aldrin pesticides hadthe highest concentrations (0.62, 0.59 and 0.52 µg/mL, respectively). Farms supplementing feed with soca cotton had the greatest OCP presence and concentration in milk samples compared to samples from farms which did not engage in this practice. CONCLUSION Although most OCPs have been banned in Colombia since 1986, residues are still being presented in raw milk samples tested from cottongrowing farms, thereby creating a public health risk for consumers.</dc:description>
