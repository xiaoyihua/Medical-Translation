<dc:description xml:lang="en">The case of young woman with arterial hypertension diagnosed two years before, is here presented; she had a ferropenic anemia caused by digestive loss of blood. Multiple gastric tumors and pararenal non functioning paraganglioma were found. No chondromas were detected. An incomplete Carney's Triad was diagnosed. We remark that multiple gastric tumors in a young adult suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) Endoscopic biopsy frequently is not effective because these tumors are deep placed in the muscular gastric layers. The importance of specific techniques for a positive diagnosis are emphasized. Continuous follow up is needed because these tumors have uncertain prognosis. Lung chondromas may appear years later after the GIST was removed and might be confused with GIST metastases.</dc:description>
