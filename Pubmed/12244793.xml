<dc:description xml:lang="en">"Syndrome of recommended patient" is manifested as the presence of numerous unexpected and unusual complications in patients that the treating physician is trying to give a better assistance. Even assuming that a few complications may appear by chance, there are several factors from daily clinical practice that facilitate the presence of such a syndrome, and some of them can be corrected in order to reduce its incidence. All of them come from the change on daily clinical practice on these patients, as if they do not fit for the attention provided for other people. These factors favouring the presence of this syndrome come from: patients' attitude, inefficient use of health resources, absence of an adequate register of clinical data and change in usual clinical practice on interpretation of diagnostic tests as well as in the indication of treatment of these patients. The best way to prevent this "syndrome of recommended patient" is to maintain, even within these patients, an attitude based on solid clinical knowledge and to follow up the same clinical rules accepted for other patients.</dc:description>
