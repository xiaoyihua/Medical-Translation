<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to know the immune state of the adult population of Catalonia (Spain) versus tetanus. METHODS The prevalence of antitetanic antibodies was determined in a representative sample (n = 604) of this population group (greater than or equal to 15 years). The technique used as that of passive hemagglutination reaction. The field work was carried out during 1989. RESULTS 37.7% of the males and 15.7% of the females (p less than 0.001) presented titres of protector antibodies (greater than or equal to 0.01 Ul/ml) versus tetanus. The prevalence of antibodies was higher in youths of either sex and progressively descended with age. No statistically significant association was found upon performance of multivariate analysis between the sociodemographic variables (place of birth, level of education, residence, social class) and the prevalence of antibodies. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study demonstrate that antitetanic vaccination currently being undertaken is not sufficient to insure adequate protection during adult life thus potentiating the need for the vaccination of adults in Catalonia.</dc:description>
