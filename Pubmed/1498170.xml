<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Study of the serologic response in two groups of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: with and without treatment. METHODS Antibodies (type IgG) against the A60 antigen were studied in 103 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: 46 without specific treatment and 57 after the application of the chemotherapy. RESULTS 81.6% of the patients showed antibodies against the A60 antigen and 60.2% were strongly positive; 32.6% and 41.3% of the patients without treatment were negative and strongly positive respectively. In the patients with treatment this results were 7% and 75.4%. The differences found between both groups were statistically significant (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS It is concluded that the application of the specific treatment modify in a high percentage the response of antibody against A60 antigen and which reduced the false negatives response, this fact could condition the clinic utility of the test.</dc:description>
