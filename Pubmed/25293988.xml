<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of patients with hepatic hydatid cyst treated at the department of general surgery of a national referral hospital in Lima (Peru). MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed, all patients diagnosed with hepatic hydatid cyst hospitalized between 1997 and 2010 were included. Sociodemographic data (age, sex, origin and usual activity), clinical, laboratory, radiographic and data referrals to treatment were collected. RESULTS The most common symptom was abdominal pain (93.9%), while the most frequent sign was the increase in liver span (68.7%). 86.4% of patients had a leukocyte formulated within normal ranges, eosinophilia was only present in 25.9% of cases. The right hepatic lobe was the most affected (80%) and in 40.8% of patient's condition one segment was found. In 75.4% of patients the cysts were unique. The most frequent complications were: communication to the bile duct (48.9%), hydatid abscesses (32.6%), cholangitis (4%), hydatid cyst and broken more peritonitis (4%). CONCLUSION The population more affected was young adults aged 30 to 39 years. The population studied lives mostly in the department of Lima, but come from departments where hepatic hydatid disease has been described as endemic. Although this population is mostly urban, epidemiological characteristics do not vary in relation to that described in previous research.</dc:description>
