<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Helicobacter pylori has been involved in gastric epithelial cell damage and gastric gland loss or atrophy. AIMS To evaluate role of Helicobacter pylori infection in acute and chronic changes of chronic gastritis in a high gastric cancer-risk population. MATERIAL AND METHODS 200 patients with chronic gastritis were selected from pathological files of Temuco Hospital. A complete histopathological protocol was fulfilled considering the presence of infection by Helicobacter pylori-like-organism (HLO), acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrate, epithelial cell damage and epithelial cell regeneration. RESULTS 82% of patients showed infection by HLO. Moreover, this infection reached a frequency of 92.7% in gastric ulcer patients and 94.4% in duodenal ulcer patients. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between HLO infection and polymorphonuclear infiltrate, lymphocytic infiltrate, mucus depletion and epithelial regenerative activity. There was not a statistical correlation between HLO infection and atrophy. Finally, 90% of patients with multifocal atrophic gastritis and 100% of patients with diffuse antral gastritis had HLO infection. CONCLUSIONS HLO gastric infection frequently caused acute inflammatory changes in gastric mucosa with chronic gastritis. Sometimes these changes were severe, with marked polymorphonuclear migration throughout epithelium and severe epithelial cell damage. Recovery of these changes could be considered as a goal in Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy decision.</dc:description>
