<dc:description xml:lang="en">With the aim of determining the dynamics of malaria transmission in the village of Charambirá (Chocó), Colombia, studies on the age structure of Anopheles neivai (a known vector on the Pacific Coast) were undertaken, based on its gonadotrophic status. Mosquitoes were captured indoors at sunset using human bait and bucal aspirators and then maintained in cylindrical cardboard boxes, with damp paper and feeding dispensaries, until dissection on the following day. Of the 200 specimens dissected during September-October 1986, 68 (34%) showed traces of less than two ovipositions, while the rest (66%) evidenced at least three ovipositions. The difference between the first group considered as "non-infective" and the second group considered as "potentially infective" was highly significant (X2 = 10.68; P = 0.001). The study showed that 1.5% of the dissected A. neivai had traces of ten ovipositions demonstrating high longevity and multiple bloodfeedings. The results suggest that there is a considerable risk of contracting malaria in Charambirá at dusk.</dc:description>
