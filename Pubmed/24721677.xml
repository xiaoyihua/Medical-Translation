<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Childhood obesity is considered the main risk factor for the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) during childhood, adolescence and adulthood. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MetS components and its main defining combinations in a sample of school children with and without obesity. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 225 children aged 6-12 years, 106 obese and 119 with normal weight were included. MetS was defined by the presence of 3 or more of the following: obesity as a body mass index ≥ 95th percentile, fasting glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL, triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, high density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL-c)&lt;40 mg/dL and systolic and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 95th percentile. RESULTS We found MetS components in both groups. Most frequent abnormalities in the obese group included increased levels of HDL-c, triglycerides, fasting glucose and total cholesterol, while increased levels of glucose and total cholesterol, and lower HDL-c levels predominated in the normal weight group. The prevalence of MetS in the obese group was 44.3% and, in normal weight children, it was 0.84%. The 3 main components that defined the MetS in the obese group were obesity/triglycerides/HDL-c (34.0%), obesity/glucose/triglycerides/HDL-c (29.8%) and obesity/glucose/HDL-c (14.9%), while the only combination observed in the normal weight group was glucose/HDL-c/triglycerides. CONCLUSION A percentage of 44.3 of obese school children had MetS, and dyslipidemia showed to be strong determinants of MetS. Although the prevalence of MetS was low in children with normal weight, one third of them showed one of the components of MetS.</dc:description>
