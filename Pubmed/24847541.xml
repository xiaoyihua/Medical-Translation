<dc:description xml:lang="en">Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterised by the destruction of the skeletal muscle, releasing myoglobin, electrolytes and muscle enzymes into the circulatory system. The causes are varied, the most frequent being intense physical exercise, trauma and alcohol. The clinical presentation is also variable and the classic symptoms of muscular pain, weakness and dark urine are not always present. The diagnosis is usually made after detecting an increase in serum levels of the enzyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK) higher or equal to five times the upper limit of normal. The most important aspect of the treatment is the early and aggressive hydration of the patient with intravenous normal saline infusion which avoids complications such as acute renal failure. The prognosis is always excellent when the treatment is carried out early.</dc:description>
