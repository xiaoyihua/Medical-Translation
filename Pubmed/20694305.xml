<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the maternal nutritional state through simple anthropometric indicators as middle-arm circumference (MAC), half thigh (HTC) and calf (CC), to value changes in the body mass and quantity of total fat, in women on second and third pregnancy trimester. METHODOLOGY A sample of 76 pregnant aged between 18 and 40 years, from suburban communities of the municipalities Baruta and The Hatillo, Venezuela were evaluated. Weigh, height, MAC, HTC and CC, besides triceps, biceps, subscapular, half thigh and calf skinfolds were measured that allowed the construction of indicators of mass and quantity of total body fat. RESULTS The HTC and CC showed differences (p &lt; 0.05) between second and third pregnancy trimester. Average values of MAC presented no statistical significance among the evaluated trimesters, neither the arm fat area, but the thigh fat area and calf what could explain the differences observed in the circumferences of these members among the evaluated trimesters. CONCLUSIONS Circumferences of inferior members (half thigh and calf), probably be the variables that can be used for evaluate the anthropometric nutritional maternal status, allow to predict the possible changes in the fat component, and therefore in the body composition of pregnant.</dc:description>
