<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the response and adverse effects to treatment with Sildenefil in those patients with an erectile dysfunction who, according to our protocol, were considered as candidates for this therapeutic option. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed the clinical histories of 180 patients seen in our service from november 1988 to February 1999 as a result of an erectile dysfunction. Those patients in whom the use of Sildenefil was not contraindicated were prescribed this product at does of 50 mg. The response to treatment was subjectively evaluated based on the option of the patient when comparing his quality of life before and after treatment. RESULTS Out of 180 patients, 144 started treatment as indicated. Of these, 67% expressed a positive response, while 33% did not respond to treatment. Adverse effects were notice by 26% of patients, but in 97% of them they were not severe enough to withdraw the medication. CONCLUSIONS Two-thirds of 144 patients with erectile dysfunctions of heterogeneous origin responded positively to treatment with Sildenefil. One fourth of them reported some ort of adverse effect, but almost none of them stopped the medication for this reason.</dc:description>
