<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Area 7 of the autonomous region of Madrid has one of the highest incidences of tuberculosis (23/100,000 population per year 2004). This study aimed to identify tuberculosis control in this area. METHODS A descriptive study of tuberculosis cases diagnosed in area 7 from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2004 was carried out by analyzing the incidence of tuberculosis and the management of cases and their contacts. We also analyzed the microepidemics that occurred during this period. RESULTS The incidence of tuberculosis in area 7 during this period was 30.9/100,000 inhabitants. Respiratory tuberculosis accounted for 80.9% of all tuberculosis cases; of these, contact investigation was only undertaken in 38%. Thirty-five percent of cases were lost to follow-up. In the 24 microepidemics detected during the study period, 29 secondary cases were diagnosed; of these, the protocol for contact investigation was not correctly followed in 48%. CONCLUSION The lack of information and/or errors in the management of cases and their contacts should be corrected by establishing a new program to ensure proper treatment and follow-up of cases, contact investigations and correct reporting.</dc:description>
