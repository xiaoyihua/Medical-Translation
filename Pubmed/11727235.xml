<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To refer two children with acute encephalitis and bilateral basal ganglia lesion and its neurological outcome. CLINICAL CASES Two girls, one of 9 years and the other of 15 months of age were affected by acute encephalitis, bilateral basal ganglia lesion was found on MRI in both children. Abnormal movements (tremor, choreoatetosis) and dystonia were the main symptomatology. In the first girl a mild dystonic posture on her hand and minor bradykinesia was the only found after a 4 year follow up. The other child, after 17 months of the beginning of her disease, still has generalized dystonia and choreoatetosis movements. Control MRI studies, in both patients remain without changes. CONCLUSION In acute encephalitis, basal ganglia lesion in two children, produced different neurological sequelae, probably related to the age of the presentation of the disease.</dc:description>
