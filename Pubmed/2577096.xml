<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Edinburgh Declaration was the final document of the World Conference on Medical Education held in Edinburgh from August 7 to 12, 1988. It was intended to attain the revolutionary significance of the Flexner Report or the Declaration of Alma Ata. The social and politics aspects involved in medical education are stressed and well known educational strategies are outlined. However, the Declaration lacks internal consistency and falls short in new ideas to improve medical education. Crucial aspects of this activity are not discussed, such as the relations between medical practice and culture, between social orientation of medical students and the nature of health institutions in which they receive education. The importance of developing an ethical background in the students is also missing. Implicit in the Declaration is a charge to Medical Schools for injustices in health delivery to the population without due regard to restrictions and limitations derived from local social, political and economic conditions. In contrast to the Declaration, the background document for the Conference is an outstanding synthesis of matters with great educational significance. Specific recommendations and proposed, courses of action are clearly outlined and may be used by Medical Schools to identify problems, evaluate their current status and design policies and strategies for future development.</dc:description>
