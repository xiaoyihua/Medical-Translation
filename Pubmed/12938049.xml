<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION It has been suggested that between 3% and 13% of the cerebral abscesses (CA) are presumably associated to oral infections or dental procedures. AIM Determine the prevalence of CA of oral origin, discussing their clinical and microbiological characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospectively, 54 cases of CA diagnosed in 3 hospitals of Galicia between 2001 and 2002 were reviewed. RESULTS A presumed oral portal of entry was recorded in 6 patients (11.1%); 4 cases were associated to oral infections and the remaining 2 had received dental treatment in the months prior to the onset of symptoms. Half of the patients showed irrelevant medical record, 2 had had previous extracranial abscesses and 1 presented a type A immunoglobulin deficiency. In 4 cases, the microbiological analysis was positive and typical oral bacteria (Streptococcus viridans and Peptostreptococcus spp.) were identified. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that a significant number of CA are probably of oral origin. In consequence, to maintain a good oral health status is important and specific prophylactic measures before any dental procedure should be applied, especially in patients with risk recognized factors.</dc:description>
