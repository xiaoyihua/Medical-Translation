<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Approximately 65 % of young smokers have failed to give up smoking because of their addiction to nicotine. The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence is used to quantify nicotine dependence in adults but studies in teenagers are scarce. OBJECTIVES To determine whether young smokers are nicotine-dependent, and if so, to what extent, as well as the factors linked to nicotine dependence. METHODS A total of 2647 schoolchildren, aged 10 to 17 years old, from 41 different schools were interviewed. A sample size was calculated for each age, in years, by using the equation of finite population, but adding an extra 10 % so that if the numbers decreased, the final absolute error would not be increased. For each age the sample was stratified by sex and type of school, with proportional affixation to the number of individuals within each stratum. Schools and students were chosen by using the random numbers table. In addition to eliciting personal data, the questionnaire also included a version of the FTND adapted for use in teenagers. RESULTS The mean age was 13.77 years and 51.5 % were male. A total of 23.1 % reported they were smokers (54.5 % of them were girls and 45.5 % were boys). Most (86.6 %) of these teenager smokers showed low-moderate nicotine dependence and 3.3 % showed high dependence. No differences were found according to sex or age. CONCLUSIONS Most teenagers who smoke show low nicotine dependence. Campaigns to prevent smoking should be aimed at children aged less than 10 years old to delay smoking the first cigarette and the subsequent next step of becoming a daily smoker for as long as possible since both factors have proved decisive in nicotine dependence.</dc:description>
