<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED This study aims to evaluate how rehydration beverage ingestion influences gastric emptying rate (in cycle ergometer) at rest and during exercise at 70 % of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). MATERIAL AND METHOD 26 well-trained cyclists performed a preliminary maximal test until exhaustion to evaluate their VO2max, and two submaximal exercise tests at 70 % of their mode-specific VO2max. Each test was separated by one week. During the two submaximal tests, cyclists consumed 200 ml of a 99mTc-DTPA labeled rehydration beverage (A or B) and scintigraphy determinations were performed at rest. After, exercise was initiated for 60 minutes with an intake rate of 200 ml every 15 minutes, making gastric serial scintigraphy determinations. The difference regarding chemical composition between A and B drinks resides in the fact that drink A contains a smaller load in carbohydrates (10.3 g/100 ml versus 15.2 g/100 ml of B), proteins in form of serum milk and antioxidants in form of fruit juice. Both contain ions and vitamins. RESULTS at rest, gastric count number was significantly reduced (p &gt; 0.000) from 0 to 25 minutes for both A and B beverage. At the end of exercise (60 min), there was greater gastric retention for B beverage than for A, this difference being statistically significant (p &lt; 0.031). CONCLUSIONS The A beverage, a rehydration drink on the market with protein and antioxidants with fruit juice content, has a faster gastric emptying rate than the B sport beverage.</dc:description>
