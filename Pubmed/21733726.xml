<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES 1) Evaluation of the level of satisfaction on the care received in women diagnosed with breast cancer and identifying improvement areas, 2) Comparison of proportions of patients satisfied and dissatisfied with the attention received in the Oncology Services (OS) in Asturias (Spain). METHODS Multicenter, cross-sectional comparative study using an anonymous and voluntary satisfaction survey. The studied population was composed of women diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, and receiving care in OS in Asturias. The tool used was the modified SERVQHOS, adapted to our context. Analysis was performed to determine Cronbach's alpha reliability of the instrument after the adjustments; descriptive statistics and Pearson chi-square test were carried out in the comparisons of satisfaction in the different OS, assuming a confidence level of 95%. The SPSS 18.0 statistics package was used. RESULTS A total of 85 patients the OS A, 107 from the OS B and 34 from the OS C participated. The information provided by doctors was the only aspect of the objective quality with which participants of the OS A were satisfied. Significant differences were found between departments regarding the status of the clinics (P&lt;.00) and waiting times (P&lt;.00). All the participants were satisfied with the kindness of the staff, but the highest proportion of dissatisfied was in OS B (P&lt;.00). Communication with family members did not reach participants' expectations in OS C (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS Our findings have identified improvement opportunities in several aspects of care in our OS. From them, aspects evaluated as positive might be promoted, while corrective actions might be established for the negative ones, all of them aimed to improve the quality of care in OS in Asturias.</dc:description>
