<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study evaluates the Health-Related Quality of Life of patients undergoing analogous and allogeneic transplantation at three different points in time: before, 30 and 180 days after transplantation, along with correlated clinical and socio-demographic data. Two questionnaires were used for data collection: the first addressed clinical and socio-demographic data and the second was the Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy translated and validated for Brazilian Portuguese. The initial sample was composed of 30 patients while 26 were ultimately evaluated at the three points. The set of results indicated a positive impact on Health-Related Quality of Life six months after transplantation. Despite the fact that there were additional concerns and some aspects such as physical and functional aspects were affected 30 days after the procedure, the Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy scores obtained six months after HSCT improved in all components, reaching levels above those prior to the procedure, especially physical and emotional aspects and the relationship with the physician.</dc:description>
