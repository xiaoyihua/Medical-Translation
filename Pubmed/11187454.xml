<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine factors associated with hospitalization in a representative sample of population older than 64 years. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS Cohort study on a sample of 3,214 representative subjects of the population 65 years and older from the judicial district of Toledo (Spain). METHOD Personal home interview collecting data on: sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, basic and instrumental activities of daily life, conigitive decline and depressive disorder, self-rated health and previous use of health services. Hospital discharge in the 12-month period after the interview in anyone of the three hospitals in the study area were analyzed. RESULTS 342 (10.6%) of the subjects spent at least one night in the hospital in the year after the accomplishment of the interview. Risk factors for hospitalization in the logistical model were: advanced age (OR: 1.02), male sex (OR: 1.37), presence of cardiopathy (OR: 1.97) or chronic obstruction to airflow (OR: 1.57), visual deficit (OR: 1.88), worse self-rated health (OR: 1.37) and having used the hospital previously (OR: 3.45). Alcohol consumption was a protective factor (OR: 0.70). CONCLUSIONS Risk factors for hospitalization are of diverse origin. The previous admission is the strongest predictive factor for new hospitalization.</dc:description>
