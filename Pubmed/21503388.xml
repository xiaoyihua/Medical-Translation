<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The need to improve the exercise testing accuracy, pushed the development of scores, whose applicability was already broadly recognized. OBJECTIVE Prognostic evaluation of stable coronary disease through a new simplified score. METHODS A new score was applied in 372 multivessel coronary patients with preserved ventricular function, 71.8% male, age: 59.5 (± 9.07) years old, randomized to medical treatment, surgery (CABG) or angioplasty (PTCA), with 5 years of follow-up. Cardiovascular death was considered the primary endpoint. Non-fatal myocardial infarction, death and re-intervention were considered for a combined secondary endpoint. The score was based on an equation previously validated, resulting from a sum of one point for: male gender, infarction history, angina, diabetes, insulin use and one point for each decade of life after 40 years old. Positive exercise testing summed one additional point. RESULTS Thirty six deaths was observed (10 in group PTCA, 15 in CABG and 11 in the clinical group), p = 0.61. We observed 93 combined events: 37 in PTCA group, 23 in CABG and 33 in the clinical group (p = 0.058). 247 patients presented clinical score ≥ 5 points and 216 ≥ 6 points. The cutoff point ≥ 5 or ≥ 6 points identified higher risk, p = 0.015 and p = 0.012, respectively. The survival curve showed a different death incidence after the randomization when score reached 06 points or more (p = 0.07), and a distinct incidence of combined events between the patients with score &lt; 6 and ≥ 6 points (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION The new score was consistent for multiarterial stable coronary disease risk stratification.</dc:description>
