<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The presence of distant metastasis (DM) after the initial treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is not considered a common event and it is associated to a poor outcome. PURPOSE To investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with the diagnosis of distant metastasis in SCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS A retrospective study of 633 patients with HNSCC to describe the clinical characteristics of the DM. RESULTS During the follow-up period after the initial treatment, 6.2% of the patients were diagnosed of having distant metastasis. The site of primary tumor was hypopharynx in 14.4%, unknown origin in 11.8% and oropharynx in 8.5%. The most common sites of DM were the lungs (58%) and the bone (22%). Three year overall survival in patients with DM was 2.5% (versus 49,5% in the control group). CONCLUSIONS This study confirms that DM have an adverse impact in survival. There is a need of guidelines for screening of distant metastases in patients with HNSCC in order to get an early diagnosis and a more effective treatment. Because of the poor prognosis of DM, protocols including adjuvant chemotherapy should be investigated.</dc:description>
