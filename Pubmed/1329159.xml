<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Benzodiazepines relieve anxiety and modify the endocrine response to surgical-anesthetic stress. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of four benzodiazepines on preoperative secretion of cortisol and ACTH. MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied 60 patients programmed for abdominal surgery. Patients were randomly allocated into six groups of treatment: control group (placebo), diazepam 10 mg, triazolam 0.5 mg, alprazolam 0.5 mg, bromazepam 6 mg, and bromazepam 12 mg. Blood samples for cortisol and ACTH measurements were obtained at five different stages of the anesthetic-surgical procedure: baseline, preanesthesia, anesthesia, surgery, and postoperative phase. RESULTS Diazepam and bromazepam (6 and 12 mg) lessened the increase in plasmatic cortisol induced by preanesthesia and anesthesia in control patients. Triazolam attenuated the cortisol response only during preanesthesia. Administration of 12 mg of bromazepam decreased ACTH levels during preanesthesia and anesthesia with respect to the control group. CONCLUSIONS Benzodiazepines failed to modify cortisol and ACTH levels during surgery and during the immediate postoperative period. The most marked attenuation of adrenocortical response was achieved with 12 mg of bromazepam and the less marked lessening was induced by 0.5 mg of alprazolam.</dc:description>
