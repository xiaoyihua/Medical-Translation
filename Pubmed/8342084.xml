<dc:description xml:lang="en">Community participation constitutes a central strategy in the provision of health services, particularly in poor communities in this country. Little is known, however, about the different actors's point of view regarding this strategy. This is true particularly for female community members and community workers. In this paper, historical antecedents of community participation are discussed and some results of a research work are presented, which explored attitudes and opinions of different groups of interviewees, regarding the idea of community participation in health and family planning. The involved groups are: female community members, community workers, community leaders, medical supervisors which control community workers, and medical executives which control those supervisors. It is emphasized that medical executives are the strongest supporters of community participation, while community members are the weakest. The importance of taking into account the community members' position on matters such as community participation in family planning is stressed.</dc:description>
