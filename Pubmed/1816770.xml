<dc:description xml:lang="en">We have gathered information of particular interest to students of medicine and recent graduates about the law that regulates the practice of medicine in Puerto Rico. We have also reviewed the current information about how to obtain the examination of the Puerto Rico Board of Medical Examiners, and the requirements to obtain the provisional licenses for postgraduate training (internship and residency), for the compulsory year of government service and for the regular license. We have compared 1980, 1986, and 1990 as to the number of internships in the 28 programs available. At present it is quite likely that physicians with marginal credentials will have a difficult time finding a place in fully accredited programs. Since July 1980 the unauthorized practice of practice medicine is considered a serious offense. The increasing number of malpractice suits and the recent changes in the law have made the practice of medicine in Puerto Rico increasingly risky.</dc:description>
