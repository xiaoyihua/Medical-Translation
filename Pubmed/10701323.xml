<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Cardiac glucoside intoxication is a frequent medical problem given the following: the very narrow therapeutic range, its use in advanced aged patients, in patients with altered renal function, and because of interaction with other drugs. There are two types of digitalis intoxication: one that appears as a complication of the treatment with digitalis, and the other as a result of an accidental ingestion or in suicide attempt. The objective of this study was to review and assess the level of scientific evidence on the effectiveness and the indications of use of Fab fragments of antidigoxine antibodies. METHODS A systematic bibliographic search in the following databases was made: MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, The Iowa Drug Information Service, Embase, LMS/R&amp;D Insight, and Indice Médico Español. The selected papers were classified according to their level of scientific evidence. RESULTS Abstracts of 252 references were reviewed. In the reviewed bibliography no controlled, randomized trials were found. Most of the studies found are descriptions of case series or single cases that were treated with antidigoxin Fab fragments. These types of studies provide little or no scientific evidence to speak of. None of the treatment regimes with antidigoxin antibody Fab fragments so far proposed have proven to be valid in a controlled, randomized clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS There is a very high level of concordance among the studies reviewed with regards to the efficacy and the indications for the use of Fab fragments in severe acute accidental digitalis intoxication and in suicide attempts. Regarding those intoxications that result in patients undergoing digitalis therapy, usual therapeutic approach is traditional treatment and the monitorization of the severity of the intoxication.</dc:description>
