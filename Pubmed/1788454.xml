<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ninety nine patients suffering of acute pyelonephritis are prospectively analyzed. Mean age was 39.8 +/- 18.2 (mean +/- DE), 72 of them were females and 19 were males. The most frequent clinical manifestations were fever and side pain in 97% of the cases and lower urinary syndrome in 78%. The duration of symptoms previous to the visit was 3.5 +/- 2.9 days. Bacteremia was confirmed in 99% of cases, it affected the oldest patients (p less than 0.001) and provoked the lasting of fever (p less than 0.05). E. coli was the most frequently isolated microorganism with an incidence of 91% in the isolated samples. Gentamicin was the initial treatment and the definitive treatment was prolonged to a total of 14 days. Fifteen percent of patients were classified after the evaluation as carriers of complicated pyelonephritis and had to undergo afterwards a urologic treatment. Follow up over a minimum of 6 weeks showed a treatment failure in 2% of cases and recurrency in 22%.</dc:description>
