<dc:description xml:lang="en">To determine risk factors, a clinical, cardiologic, biochemical and nutritional study was carried out. A sample of the rural population of Comi-Co (N = 92), which included descendants of Mapuche indians, was compared with a sample of the urban population of Viedma (N = 94). Sheep, goat and horse meat from the rural district was analyzed. In horse meat, intramuscular fat was 1.16 g%, with 34.5% of polyunsaturated fatty acids including linolenic (18:3 w3) 11.9%, linoleic (18:2 w6) 21.0%. The diet intake of the rural population was very different from that of the urban population (p &lt; 0.001). It contained 3420 +/- 1027 vs 2110 +/- 654 kcal, carbohydrates 40 +/- 8 vs 55 +/- 10%, lipids 33 +/- 5 vs 24 +/- 8%, proteins 28 +/- 6 vs 20 +/- 6%, cholesterol 1021 +/- 380 vs 385 +/- 156 mg/day. The rural population showed a tendency to suffer cholelithiasis. Comi-Co vs Videma males had a CHDL 53 +/- 13 vs 47 +/- 9 mg/dl (p &lt; 0.05) and no significant differences were found between both groups when it came to blood glucose, uric acid, triglycerides and Apo B. The frequency of individuals with CT &gt; or = 240 mg/dl, CLDL &gt; or = 160 mg/dl, cigarettes &gt; or = 10/day seems to be less in the rural district. In Viedma vs Comi-Co males, with any one primary factor there was a ratio of 45% vs 24% (p &lt; 0.05). The proportion of males with two risk factors was low. No individuals with three risk factors were found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
