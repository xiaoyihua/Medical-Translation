<dc:description xml:lang="en">With the establishment of early arthritis clinics, patients can now be increasingly attended early in the course of their disease. This means that a significant proportion of these patients cannot be classified into a specific diagnosis using the traditional American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria. In these patients with undifferentiated arthritis (UA), even more important than assigning a diagnosis is the need to distinguish between patients who will develop a persistent and/or erosive disease and will be candidates for prompt treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD), and patients in whom the disease is self limiting. Serologic markers in combination with clinical features at presentation, integrated into predictive models, are the tools currently available to the clinician for identifying these patients. Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of early treatment in UA.</dc:description>
