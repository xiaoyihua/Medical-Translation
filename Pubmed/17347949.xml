<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Borderline intellectual capacity (BIC) is defined by the detection of an intelligence quotient of between 71 and 84. In most cases, the diagnosis of BIC only represents the appreciation of one characteristic measured by intelligence tests. Thus, in most patients with BIC there is an underlying disorder that has helped to configure an intelligence quotient within the borderline range. The executive functions themselves, in addition to playing a role in the cognitive foundations of the disorders associated with BIC, also exert an effect on the degree of intelligence. AIM To evaluate the impact of executive dysfunction in a group of patients with BIC. PATIENTS AND METHODS A group of 87 patients who had been diagnosed with BIC were selected and their clinical diagnoses were analysed. The scores from the BRIEF questionnaire for evaluating the executive functions were obtained for 51 of the patients. These results were compared with those from a sample of patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). RESULTS Prevalence of neurocognitive disorders (ADHD, learning difficulties and pervasive developmental disorders) was high in the group of patients. Moreover, an important degree of executive function involvement was also observed. CONCLUSIONS Neurodevelopmental disorders, and more particularly ADHD, exert a strong influence on intellectual capacity. Early detection and intervention in those disorders may prevent many cases of BIC by lessening the sustained impact of a poor working memory.</dc:description>
