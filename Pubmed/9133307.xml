<dc:description xml:lang="en">To assess the efficacy and safety of the AVE Micro Stent, we deployed 204 stents in 144 consecutive patients during a one year period. Indications for stenting were acute closure in 3.4%, dissection in 5.4%, post balloon pTCA restenosis in 3.4%, non-favorable result in 16.7% and de novo in 71.1%. Patient population included 39 (27%) patients with stable angina, 86 (59.7%) with unstable angina, 16 (11.1%) with acute MI and 3 (2.1%) with cardiogenic shock. Angiographic lesion morphology were as follows: type A, 17.7%, type B1, 42.1%; type B2, 16.2%; type C, 24%. Procedural success was obtained in 204 of 205 attempted stents (99.5%) and clinical success was 93.1%. Oral anticoagulation was not routinely used. Enzymatic elevation consistent with myocardial necrosis occurred in 3.2% with Q wave MI in 0.7%. Three patients (2.1%) had bleeding at site of femoral puncture with one requiring transfusion and surgery. Mortality was 0.8% in the angina group, 6.25% in the MI group and one of the 3 patients with cardiogenic shock died and represents the only apparent stent thrombosis as she experienced sudden death one week after successful left main stenting. We conclude that high success rates can be obtained with the AVE Micro Stent due to it's excellent trackability, adequate radio-opacity and relative flexibility.</dc:description>
