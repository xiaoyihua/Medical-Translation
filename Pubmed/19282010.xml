<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the results for sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in patients with multifocal breast cancer (MBC) in comparison to in those with unifocal breast cancer (UBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 1535 prospective SNB (174 on patients with MBC) were performed at 9 hospitals. In most patients, Tc-99m albumin colloids were injected intraparenchymally into each tumoral focus for SNB. RESULTS The overall identification rate was 93.8%; no differences between groups were observed (94.8% in MBC vs 93.4% in UBC). The mean number of sentinel nodes detected was 1.46, being higher in the MBC group than in the UBC group (1.58 vs 1.45; p=0.036). Extra-axillary sentinel nodes were found in 19.6%; extra-axillary sentinel nodes were more common in the MBC group (23.4% vs 18.9%, ns) and in the internal mammary chain and in level III axillary lymph nodes. The incidence of sentinel node metastasis was 27.3% (29.1% MBC vs 26.7% UBC, ns), and the mean number of positive sentinel nodes was 0.42 in the MBC group vs 0.32 in the UBC group (p=ns). Axillary dissection identified the same rate of positive additional nodes (29.7%) in both groups. CONCLUSIONS The diagnostic yield of SNB seems similar in MBC and UBC. In MBC, there appears to be a specific pattern of lymphatic drainage, with a higher number of sentinel nodes detected and probably a higher number of extra-axillary sentinel nodes.</dc:description>
