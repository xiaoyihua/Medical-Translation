<dc:description xml:lang="en">By primarily using treatises on medical policy and texts on public hygiene and social medicine as sources, we shall analyse the idea of well-being in the course of Spanish medicine prior to the birth of the Welfare State. We shall look at the economic connotation that this idea acquired during the Enlightenment, and how, towards the end of this period, this idea was incorporated into the development of medicine, and which from that time onwards varied in content during every age depending on the social circumstances of the moment and the corporativist interests of the doctors. This can be clearly seen in the case of good health, which although it was always one of the elements of this view of "well-being" did however become more prominent on three occasions: at the end of the Enlightenment, in the middle of the 19th century (Méndez Alvaro), and during the second decade of this century (Martín Salazar, Codina and Amalio Jimeno).</dc:description>
