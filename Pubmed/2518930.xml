<dc:description xml:lang="en">A descriptive study of virtually all patients with leprosy in the Córdoba province was carried out. The socioeconomic and hygienic features of the patients' homes, some clinical variables, the therapeutic habits and the features of the foci were evaluated. The major findings were as follows: More than 50% of patients had poor socioeconomic background. 32% were a clinically active stage of the disease, 42% had some degree of disability and one half of the patients did not usually comply with the treatment. The importance of the socioeconomic and hygienic background as a possible risk factor for the development and the worsening of the disease are apparent. What we have defined as a contagion-favoring environment is associated with poor hygienic status of the patient's home (p = 0.001). The lack of compliance with treatment is associated with poorer social and hygienic status (p less than 0.001).</dc:description>
