<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Retained foreign bodies or embolization in cardiac chambers is a relatively common clinical problem. As experience was acquired, it became apparent that failure to remove such fragments could result in morbility or mortality. In the past, surgical removal was the only method available. We present our experience of percutaneous extractions of embolized foreign bodies. The technical aspects are discussed. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty eight cases (age between 1 and 80 years) of cardiac and intravascular foreign bodies seen in two hospitals are reported. Seventeen were plastic catheters or fragments (two were radiotransparent), 5 guide wires in vena cava, right atrial and ventricle, pulmonary artery and abdominal aorta, 4 patients had pacemaker electrodes in the right atrium or ventricle. Stent embolization was observed in two patients. The stents were stripped from the delivery catheter and removed from iliac artery. A pigtail catheter was sometimes used to remove the fragment found in the right ventricle. In 8 cases the capture and extraction was made using a loop snare with a 0.025 inch guide J-wire device folded in half at its midsection and inserted through a long introducer, and in another 20 cases a Dormia basket system was used. In all four patients with pacemaker electrodes, simple counteraction was used with a 10 F left coronary directional atherectomy guide catheter. RESULTS In two patients removal was impossible--in one the pacemaker electrode was caught but not retrieved because was densely adhered to the endocardium for several years; in another a guide wire was found in a child one year old--. In the other 26 patients, foreign body extraction was performed percutaneously without any complication with a basket or snare; only in one case (a radiotransparent catheter) both systems were used. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous removal of centrally embolized foreign bodies, cardiac or vascular, is a safe and successful procedure. The basket system needs to be used more carefully.</dc:description>
