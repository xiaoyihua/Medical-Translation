<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Our objective was to analyze the preventative behavior for accidents in adolescents in our environment. PATIENTS AND METHODS The accident preventative behavior of adolescents was studied by means of an anonymous questionnaire distributed to 268 students in a secondary school. A descriptive study regarding hazardous agents was conducted. We studied the relationships between the age, sex, number of siblings and the educational and economic level of the parents. RESULTS Our study identifies deficiencies in the prevention of burns, traffic accidents and alcohol consumption. We detected the influence of age, sex, number of siblings and sociocultural level of the parents. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of a high risk attitude in adolescents suggests that appropriate counseling by pediatricians and appropriate prevention programs should be implemented.</dc:description>
