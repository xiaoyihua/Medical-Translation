<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To quantify the magnitude and explain the trends and impact of death by homicide in Colombia and Mexico between 2000 and 2011 at the national level and by sex. METHODS Data were obtained from national homicide statistics (Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística [DANE], Colombia; and Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía [INEGI], Mexico). Standardized death rates and years of life lost (YLL) were calculated (the latter assuming zero mortality) in people 15–49 years old. RESULTS In Colombia, between 2000 and 2002, deaths by homicide increased from 71.3 to 76.7 per 100 000 (7.5%); by 2011 this figure had fallen to 36.1. YLL in the same period increased to 0.58 years overall, reducing temporary life expectancy by one year in men and 0.1 years in women. Between 2002 and 2011, YLL was 0.45 years in both sexes: 0.83 in men and 0.07 in women. This decline occurred mainly in persons over 45 years of age. In Mexico, between 2000 and 2007, homicide rates fell from 10.8 to 8.2 per 100,000 and YLL dropped by 24%. Between 2008 and 2011, mortality and YLL increased significantly in both sexes (191.2% and 164.5%, respectively), reducing life expectancy by 0.39 years in men and 0.04 years in women. CONCLUSIONS It was corroborated that there has been a decline in deaths by homicide in Colombia and a significant rise in Mexico after a period of continuous reduction. Numerous actions should be taken to continue reducing homicides in Colombia and to reverse the current trend in Mexico.</dc:description>
