<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE There is a controversy concerning infant testicular prosthesis. The problem is that this may necessitate further surgery to insert a larger prosthesis when the child gets older. An alternative strategy is to delay the placement of the definitive prosthesis until the child reaches adolescence. However, the underdeveloped scrotum may fail to accommodate the desired sized testicular prosthesis. We present scrotoplasty using hyaluronic acid gel injection as a minimally-invasive alternative to enhance the volume of scrotum until puberty. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective report of 35 boys younger than seven years old with monorchia underwent injection of hyaluronic acid for scrotal filling. Mean follow-up of 24 months (range 12-48 months). RESULTS The only complication was early resorption in 2 patients at 8 and 10 months after implantation, respectively. In long-term followup 100 per cent of the families rated the cosmetic appearance as good and 95 per cent were content with the decision regarding placement of a testicular implant irrespective of whether they had been retreated. CONCLUSIONS It shows that hyaluronic acid gel scrotal injection can provide satisfactory improvement in enhance the volume of scrotum. It is associated with high family and patient satisfaction, and provides a long-lasting result. This technique makes placement of prosthetic testis a very simple procedure that can be performed at the time of diagnostic exploration or orchiectomy, increasing scrotal space until post pubertal definitive prosthesis.</dc:description>
