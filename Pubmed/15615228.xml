<dc:description xml:lang="en">When, after many years have transpired, one thinks back to recall an event, one might fall into a trap to emphasize the passage of those events which took place, understanding them as a series of events which, linked together fortuitously, were the cause of the event itself, as though this was a natural, logical question which could not have occurred in any other manner. This article deals with an important event in Spanish nursing annals, a change in official plan of studies, or curriculum, since this meant a substantial change in the teaching of nursing, for the exercise of the nursing profession, and for the professional nursing image as a whole.</dc:description>
