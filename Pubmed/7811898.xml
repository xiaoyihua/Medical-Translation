<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To discover the frequency of presentation, the aetiological distribution and clinical importance of a moderate rise in transaminases, which were found by chance in patients free from hepatic symptomology who were attending primary care clinics. DESIGN Descriptive study of a crossover type. SETTING La Victoria Health Centre in Valladolid. PATIENTS The patients attended at any of the six general medical clinics between january and june 1993, in whom a moderate rise in transaminases was detected by chance and confirmed after a one-month interval. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Hepatic function tests were performed on 1,285 patients, in 212 of whom biochemical function was found to be disturbed. 137 of these 212 were studied in line with a diagnostic procedure worked out in collaboration with the Area specialist, after 75 had been eliminated for various reasons. The following aetiological distribution was observed: Viral 37.2% (Anti VHC + 30.7%, Ag HBs + 6.5%), ethylic 35.03%, metabolic 15.32% and medicinal 8.77%. Hemochromatosis was diagnosed in 2 patients; and a possible aetiology could not be established in 3. It was possible to perform a biopsy on 11 patients, with the suspected aetiology being confirmed in all of them. CONCLUSIONS The likelihood of the primary care doctor correctly diagnosing hepatic illnesses is high, given that we could establish an aetiology in 97% of cases. The most common aetiologies were viral and ethylic.</dc:description>
