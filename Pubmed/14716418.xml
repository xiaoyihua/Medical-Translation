<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE Gastric polyps are elevated epithelial lesions which pathogenesis and natural history are not well known. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between gastric polyps and histological changes of the surrounding mucosa. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective, descriptive and transversal study. From 6603 patients examined through upper endoscopy at the National Hospital Edgardo Rebagliati Marins (Lima-Peru) from January 2002 to May 2003,115 gastric polyps were detected (1.74%) 68 of which were included in this study. Gastric polyps were examined through endoscopy and thereafter excised, taking biopsies of the surrounding mucosa. The histological examination established the gastric polyp type and the presence of inflammation, activity (infiltration with polymorphonuclears), atrophy, metaplasia, and Helicobacter pylori in the surrounding mucosa. RESULTS Frequency of gastric polyps was as follows: hyperplastic: 51 (75%) adenomatous: 11 (16.2%) of fundic glands: 4 (5.9%) and inflammatory: 2 (2.9%). The mucosa surrounding hyperplastic polyps was characterized by the statistically significant presence of inflammation (100%, p=0.0001) and activity (84.3%, p=0.001) while the mucosa surrounding the adenomatous polyps showed statistically significant presence of inflammation (100%, p=0.0001) activity (81.8%, p=0.001), atrophy (72.7%, p=0.017) and metaplasia (72.7%, p=0.017). The severity of atrophy and metaplasia was significantly higher in the mucosa surrounding adenomatous polyps than in that surrounding hyperplastic polyps (p=0.019 and p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS Hyperplastic polyps are associated with the presence of inflammation and activity in the surrounding mucosa, whereas adenomatous polyps are associated with the presence of inflammation, activity, atrophy, and metaplasia in the surrounding mucosa. Atrophy and metaplasia were more severe in the mucosa surrounding adenomatous polyps.</dc:description>
