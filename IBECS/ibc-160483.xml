<dc:description xml:lang="es">Objective. To evaluate long-term adherence to healthy heart lifestyle habits in ischemic patients completing a cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention (CR/SP) programme and its impact on functional capacity. Design. Analytic historical cohort study of ischemic patients at moderate-risk who completed a CR/SP programme in a Cardiac Rehabilitation Unit from 2006-2007. Material and method. The study variables were collected in 3periods: Before and after the programme and 6 years later. Measurement instruments included Trichopoulou's Mediterranean diet questionnaire, the Morisky Green test, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and a stress test. Patients following 4 healthy heart recommendations were considered to be adherent. Statistical significance was set at P&lt;.05. Results. A total of 41 patients were evaluated at 6 years; 38 were men and the mean age was 56 years. Thirteen patients (32%) were considered adherent to healthy heart recommendations at 6 years. At the end of the programme and at 6 years, functional capacity was 10.4 and 8.3, respectively, in adherent patients and 9.8 and 8.9 in non-adherent patients. Loss of functional capacity in non-adherent patients was 20% compared with only 6% in adherent patients (P=.02). Conclusion. Adherence to healthy heart recommendations made in a CP/SP programme was low (32%). Patients who adhered to all the recommendations lost only 6% of their functional capacity at 6 years compared with 20% of functional capacity in non-adherent patients (AU)</dc:description>
