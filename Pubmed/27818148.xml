<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES We present the results of the Spanish Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator Registry for 2015, as compiled by the Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Section of the Spanish Society of Cardiology. METHODS Data collection sheets were voluntarily completed by each implantation team and prospectively sent to the Spanish Society of Cardiology. RESULTS The number of reported implantations was 5465 (85% of the estimated total number of implantations). The implantation rate was 118 per million population while the estimated rate was 138. First implantations comprised 71.8%. Data were obtained from 169 hospitals (7 more than in 2014). Most implantations (82.7%) were performed in men. The mean patient age was 62.8±13.3 years. Most patients showed severe or moderate-to-severe ventricular dysfunction and were in New York Heart Association function class II. The most frequent cardiac condition was ischemic heart disease, followed by dilated cardiomyopathy. Implantations for primary prevention indications comprised 58.2%. Electrophysiologists performed 79.6% of the implantations. CONCLUSIONS The 2015 Spanish Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator Registry received information on 85% of the implantations performed in Spain. The number of implantations has grown from previous years. The percentage of implantations for primary prevention indications has slightly decreased from the previous registry.</dc:description>
