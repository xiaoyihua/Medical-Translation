<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The incorporation of neuroimaging techniques into the protocol for localization of epileptogenous foci has considerably reduced the need for use of intracranial electrodes. DEVELOPMENT SPECT and PET are most useful in cases of epilepsy with no cerebral morphological anomalies, in which there are therefore no changes which shown on MR. Cerebral SPECT with perfused tracers, such as 99mTc-HMPAO, 123I-MP or 99mTc-ECD, permit the study of patients during interictal and perictal phases. In the latter case, although the procedure is complex, one may observe an increase in cerebral blood flow in the epileptogenous focus in 90% of the patients. PET with FDG allows interictal study of patients, and shows reduced metabolism in the epileptogenic region. By comparison with video-EEG there are S = 84% and SP = 86% in temporal lobe epilepsy. The diagnostic efficiency of these two techniques is rather less in the localization of extratemporal foci and in multifocal epilepsies, although it is always better than with other diagnostic techniques. They have also been shown to be useful in the prognosis of functional recovery after surgery. CONCLUSION The possibility of studying neuroreceptors may be of great use in the investigation of the etiopathogenesis of epilepsy, and thus lead to improvement in the clinical and therapeutic management of patients. With SPECT, 123I-Iomacenil and 123I-lododexetimide are used. With PET and 11C-Carfentanyl opiate receptors have been studied. With 11C-Fluomacenil one may study the cerebral distribution of the benzodiazepine receptors.</dc:description>
