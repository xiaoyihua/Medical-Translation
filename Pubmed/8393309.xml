<dc:description xml:lang="en">When in some selected patients, a direct arterial surgery (DAS) procedure or an endoluminal surgery (ES) are required for a chronic arterial ischemia (III or IV degrees), and an arteriography with contrast is absolutely contraindicated (because of severe renal failure without hemodialysis program or a severe congestive heart failure or a hyperthyroidism or a seriously demonstrated hypersensibility against the contrast agents); an angiography by digital subtraction with carbon dioxide (DIVAS-CO2) is indicated. This technique provides good quality images with minimal risks for the patient and an adequate study for ulterior treatment. We report a case of a 67-years-old woman, with diabetes-II, ischemic cardiopathy, arterial hypertension and a demonstrated hypersensibility against the iodide compounds. The patient was admitted because of a chronic ischemia (IV degree) with ischemic ulcerations on some fingers from the left foot. High doses of analgesic drugs were needed. Because the hypersensibility against the iodide compounds, an angiography with CO2 was carried out. The good quality images provided by this technique showed the factibility of a revascularization.</dc:description>
