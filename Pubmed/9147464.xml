<dc:description xml:lang="en">Trigonoplasty is a minor surgical procedure to treat vesicoureteral reflux that preserves the integrity of the vesicoureteral junction. This technique was introduced in 1984 by Gil Vernet. Between 1989 and 1995 we performed trigonoplasty in 20 children from 6 to 15 years old with primary vesicoureteral reflux. In our study 15 patients had bilateral vesicoureteral reflux and five were unilateral, they had 35 refluxing units. Gil Vernet's trigonoplasty was performed after a five year observational treatment and it was always indicated in children with special wide trigone (1 grade I, 14 grade II, 17 grade III and 3 grade IV). Surgery was successful in 94% of the patients controlled one year after. Unilateral reflux recurrence in two patients. We consider that trigonoplasty is a good procedure with indication in patients with vesicoureteral reflux with wide trigone. The procedure shorten the postoperative hospital stay and offers a similar percentage of good results as other techniques.</dc:description>
