<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The present study analyzes the prognostic influence of tumor percentage in cylinders of prostatic biopsy in this patient group. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective study of 68 patients with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, clinical stage T1-T2 who had undergone a radical prostatectomy from May 1997 to october 2000. Following preoperative parameters were analyzed: age, PSA, clinical staging, Gleason and six cylinders of ultrasonography-leaded transrectal prostatic biopsy, studying the amount of positive biopsies, the tumor percentage of the total amount of biopsies and the maximum percentage of tumor in one cylinder. Univariate (square-Chi, Student t) and multivariate (multiple logistic regression) analysis are performed in order to study the relationship of these parameters with the presence or not of an organ-located disease. RESULTS An organ-located disease was shown at 44 patients through the piece of radical prostatectomy. The univariate analysis gave all studied parameters, except age, a prognostic value of the existence or not of an organ-located disease. In the multivariate analysis only the total percentage of biopsy tumors (p = 0.0002) and PSA (p = 0.005) behaved as independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSION Tumor percentage in prostatic biopsy seems to be a factor with a high predictive value of an organ-located disease, possibly because it is an index of tumoral volume.</dc:description>
