<dc:description xml:lang="en">High digestive tract hemorrhage (HDTH) represents on average 35% of the indications for endoscopy. It shows as a complication in different digestive pathologies or secondary to coagulopathies. Endoscopic management of non-variceal HDTH includes a gamut of procedures that when grouped together, have shown to be effective and safe in its control with an important diminishing in morbidity-mortality, transfusion requirements, days of hospital stay, and the need for surgery. The most frequently employed methods are substance injections, multipolar coagulation, and thermic catheter, which achieve an average 90% hemostasis, but still inform high percentages of relapse. Approximately 25% of the patients with non-variceal hemorrhage may bleed again after endoscopic management. New procedures such as hemoclips and the combination of endoscopic methods have been used to diminish relapse. Endoscopic treatment should be carried out when we find bleeding lesions with Forrest Ia, Ib and IIa classifications, fundamentally because the risk of hemorrhagic relapse is very high among these groups. The treatment for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers diminishes, in an important manner, the risk of the recurrence of hemorrhage.</dc:description>
