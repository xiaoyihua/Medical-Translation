<dc:description xml:lang="es">INTRODUCTION. The present study was proposed in order to know the prevalence of the burnout syndrome in professionals who carry out their work in Primary Health care and its relationship with sick leaves and the quality of the prescription. METHODS. Cross-sectional study with the questionnaire Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Site: 5 Health Care Centers and 25 Peripheral medical centers. Participants. 145 professionals. Variables. The score on the subscales of Emotional Tiredness, Depersonalization and Personal Achievements of MBI. Work variables. Prescription indications. Days of sick leave in the last year. RESULTS. Participation rate: 79.23%. Mean age: 40.22 years. A high grade of burnout was detected in 36.6% (2-44.6) of the professionals. Higher scores on the different subscales were related with being male (p &lt; 0.001), older age (p: 0.034, being a family doctor (p: 0.04), working in a primary health care team (p: 0.02), greater experience (p: 0.03), greater health care pressure (p: 0.04). A lower grade of personal development was obtained if the person was demanding employment (p: 0.041). Greater emotional tiredness was related with worse indictors of prescription (fewer generic pharmaceutical products prescribed (p: 0.016), fewer antimicrobials recommended in primary health care (p: 0.002), fewer NSAIDS recommended in primary health care (p: 0.015), more type C therapeutic novelties (p: 0.004) and greater referral rate (p: 0.037) significantly with greater number of days of sick leave (p: 0.031). CONCLUSIONS. The prevalence of this syndrome in our setting is not as high as in other studies, perhaps due to lower care pressure. We observe how this process is related with greater work absenteeism due to health problems and worse quality indicators. The design of the strategies aimed at preventing this syndrome is outlines as essential elements to advance in the improvement of the quality of the services provided</dc:description>
