<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hypertension, diabetes and that cluster of metabolic alterations often referred to as the metabolic syndrome are highly prevalent in Argentina and Latin America and occur frequently as associated conditions (65%). The development of diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations prepared through the joint work of experts in different areas of medicine is desirable, considering the low rates of control achieved in the real world, and the benefits that can be expected when reasonable objectives are met. Health care resources and priorities, the socio-economic status of the population, and the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and other related diseases vary considerably in different regions of the world and also in different countries within each region, and even in different areas of individual countries. Recommendations to be usefully translated into practice should consider the particular medical and social features of the region where they should be applied and be cost-effective in terms of local needs and possibilities Effectively treatment of hypertension in general and particularly in diabetic patients is one of the major objectives to prevent target organ damage. Unfortunately, in our countries only 25% of the patients are in target. In this document a rationale therapeutic approach is analyzed for hypertension in diabetic patients. Life style changes and pharmacologic treatment combinations is extensively reporte.</dc:description>
