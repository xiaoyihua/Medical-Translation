<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyse the safety, efficacy and quality of life of patients with male stress urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy treated with the AdVance® and AdvanceXP® slings. PATIENTS AND METHOD The study included 92 patients with stress urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy treated with the AdVance® and AdVanceXP® sling between May 2008 and December 2015. A perineal repositioning test was performed in all cases with sphincter coaptation of≥1.5cm. Mild stress urinary incontinence was defined as the use of 1-2 absorbers/24h; moderate was defined as 3-5 absorbers/24h; and severe was defined as more than 5 absorbers/24h. Healing was defined as the total absence of using pads; improvement was defined as a reduction&gt;50% in the number of pads; and failure was defined as a reduction&lt;50, no improvement or worsened incontinence. Check-ups were conducted at 3, 12 and 36 months after the surgery. We employed the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) for the quality of life index. The complications are listed according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS The degree of preoperative incontinence was mild in 23.9%, moderate in 67.4% and severe in 8.7% of the patients. The mean use of preoperative pads was 3.1 (range 1-6, 95% CI). The mean preoperative ICIQ-SF score was 16.5 (15-20). Sphincter coaptation≥1.5cm using the perineal repositioning test was present in 87 patients (94.6%). The mean follow-up from insertion of the sling was 42.1 months. Some 89.1% of the patients were healed at 3 months, 70.7% were healed at 12 months, and 70.4% were healed at 36 months. The ICIQ-SF score at 3, 12 and 36 months showed significant improvement (P&lt;.001) compared with the preoperative score. CONCLUSIONS The Advance® and AdvanceXP® system are effective over time in terms of urinary continence and patient satisfaction.</dc:description>
