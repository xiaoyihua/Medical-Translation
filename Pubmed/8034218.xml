<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thirty five follicular fluid (FF) non hematic samples were analyzed. It were obtained from patients who receive ovulation induction for in vitro fertilization (FIV) and gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT). The purpose of this retrospective study was to localize one or more markers for the oocyte maturity. The degree of expansion of the oocyte-cumulus-corona radiata complex (COCC), was measured and correlated with the absorbance of the yellow pigment from FF. The scanning spectrophotometry was made in the visible range at 350 to 600 nm. The total amount of protein, estradiol and progesterone were correlated too. Spectrophotometric scan showed four groups: the first one with 20 samples had'n one peak at 413.8 nm. The 45% of this ova were classified as immature by the morphology of the COCC. The second group with seven samples showed one peak at 457.2 nm. All of this oocytes were previously classified as preovulatories. In the next two groups the combination of two peaks were present. The group three with one peak at 416.4 nm and other at 457.9 nm; with one oocyte atretic and two immature. The group four with five samples that showed the first peak at 413.6 nm, and the second peak at 562 nm of maximum absorbance. Two of this ova were classified as atretic and the rest of them like preovulatories. In this study we could not find correlation between the proteins, estradiol and progesterone levels with the morphology of the COCC. In conclusion, spectrophotometric scan of the FF could be of great value for scoring the oocyte mature, mainly in the GIFT.</dc:description>
