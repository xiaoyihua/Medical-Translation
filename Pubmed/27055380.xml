<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Prevalence of congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is approximately 1.5-6 in every 1,000 newborns. Dysfunction of the auditory nerve (auditory neuropathy) may be involved in up to 1%-10% of cases; hearing losses because of vestibulocochlear nerve (VCN) aplasia are less frequent. The objectives of this study were to describe clinical manifestations, hearing thresholds and aetiology of children with SNHL and VCN aplasia. METHODOLOGY We present 34 children (mean age 20 months) with auditory nerve malformation and profound HL taken from a sample of 385 children implanted in a 10-year period. We studied demographic characteristics, hearing, genetics, risk factors and associated malformations (Casselman's and Sennaroglu's classifications). Data were processed using a bivariate descriptive statistical analysis (P&lt;.05). RESULTS Of all the cases, 58.8% were bilateral (IIa/IIa and I/I were the most common). Of the unilateral cases, IIb was the most frequent. Auditory screening showed a sensitivity of 77.4%. A relationship among bilateral cases and systemic pathology was observed. We found a statistically significant difference when comparing hearing loss impairment and patients with different types of aplasia as defined by Casselman's classification. Computed tomography (CT) scan yielded a sensitivity of 46.3% and a specificity of 85.7%. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the most sensitive imaging test. CONCLUSIONS Ten percent of the children in a cochlear implant study had aplasia or hypoplasia of the auditory nerve. The degree of auditory loss was directly related to the different types of aplasia (Casselman's classification) Although CT scan and MRI are complementary, the MRI is the test of choice for detecting auditory nerve malformation.</dc:description>
