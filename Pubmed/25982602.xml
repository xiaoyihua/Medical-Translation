<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The Ocular Trauma Score (OTS) is a scale that estimates the prognosis of injured eyes after treatment, whose results are consistent with those of longitudinal studies. The time between injury presentation and initial care has been described as a prognostic factor for visual outcome, but the OTS features of eyes receiving early or late care after trauma have not been compared. MATERIAL AND METHODS Non-experimental, comparative, retrospective, cross sectional study. Patients from either gender, aged 5-80 years, with open globe trauma, without previous diseases that reduced visual acuity or previous intraocular surgery were included. The distribution of the OTS variables was identified. The sample was divided in two: group 1 (time between trauma occurrence and initial care ≤ 24 hours) and 2 (time &gt; 24 hours). The frequency of OTS categories of unfavorable prognosis (1-3) was compared between groups (χ(2)). RESULTS 138 eyes of 138 patients, mean age 28.8 years, 65.2% male. The evolution time ranged 2-480 hours (mean 39.9); 103 eyes were assigned to group 1 (74.6%), and 35 to group 2 (25.4%). The proportion of categories 1-3 in group 1 (82.5%, n = 85) did not differ from that in group 2 (80%, n = 28; p = 1.0). CONCLUSION The proportion of OTS categories with unfavorable prognosis did not show significant differences between the eyes who received care before or after 24 hours that could contribute to a different outcome, besides the delay in starting treatment.</dc:description>
