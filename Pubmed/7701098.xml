<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine whether multiplanar (MP) transesophageal echocardiographic views were superior to standard views (ST), in the evaluation of mitral prosthesis regurgitation (MR), particularly in presence of wall regurgitant jets. METHODS We studied all mitral prostheses (n = 43) in which pathological mitral regurgitation had been detected by multiplanar TEE between January 1993 and March 1994. Regurgitant prostheses were classified in two groups according to the presence of wall regurgitant jets and maximum turbulent color flow areas (Amax.) were measured on standard (0 and 90 degrees) and MP (0 to 180 degrees) views. RESULTS The Amax. detected on ST views were 5.80 +/- 4.60 cm2 and on MP 7.42 +/- 5.13 cm2. Student's test was used to compare both areas and significant differences were found: 1.61 cm2; 95% confidence interval from 0.94 to 2.28 cm2; p = 0.000025. The sample was divided in two groups, A (n = 33): with wall jets and B (n = 10): without wall jets. The Amax. for group A was 5.64 +/- 4.30 cm2 in ST views, and 7.51 +/- 5.12 cm2 in MP. The difference was statistically significant: 1.86 cm2, 95% c.i. from 1.04 to 2.68 cm2; p = 0.00009. Differences for group B were also statistically significant: 0.68 cm2; p = 0.0172. MP views detected a bigger regurgitant area in 26 of the 43 cases (60%). The difference between ST and MP views was significantly bigger for group A than for group B: mean 1.18 cm2; p = 0.0176. MP views detected a severer degree of MR, classified as mild moderate and severe according to the color flow area, than ST views in 8 patients. All of them had wall regurgitant jets. Three had been considered normal on ST views. CONCLUSION We conclude that MP transesophageal views are significantly superior to ST in the assessment of regurgitant prosthetic mitral valves, particularly in presence of wall regurgitant jets. Our data strongly suggest that multiplanar TEE is the procedure of choice in the assessment of wall regurgitant mitral prostheses.</dc:description>
