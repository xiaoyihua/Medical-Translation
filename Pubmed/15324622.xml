<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To study the acute variations in portal and systemic hemodynamics after propranolol and 5-isosorbide mononitrate (IMN) administration in cirrhotic patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Seventeen cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension were studied with catheterization and Doppler duplex Ultrasound Systemic hemodynamics. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), portal blood flow and resistance were evaluated in baseline, after intravenous propranolol (0.15 mg/kg), and after 20 mg p.o. of IMN. Patients who showed a decrease &gt; or = 20% and/or &lt; 12 mm/hg in HVPG were considered responders. RESULTS There were no significant differences in clinical or portal hemodynamic baseline data between responders and non-responders to the drugs. After propranolol administration cardiac index decreased (p &lt; 0.05) and pulmonary capillary pressure increased (p &lt; 0.0001). Six patients (35%) were responders; lack of response was associated with an insufficient decrease in portal blood flow or with an increase in portal resistance. After IMN administration cardiac index decreased (p &lt; 0.05) with normalization of pulmonary capillary pressure (p &lt; 0.05). Seven patients were responders to the addition of IMN (5 non-responders to propranolol) and showed a decrease in HVPG associated with a reduction in portal blood flow and resistance; in the remaining 10 patients HVPG did not decrease despite a reduction in portal blood flow, with an increase in portal resistance. CONCLUSIONS Addition of IMN increased the number of responders and reduced portal blood flow with a variable effect in portal resistance.</dc:description>
