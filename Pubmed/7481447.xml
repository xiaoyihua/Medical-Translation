<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Evaluation of the complications of splenectomy in the Sugiura-Futawaga operation. BACKGROUND Splenectomy in portal hypertension is a more difficult procedure and probably has a higher morbidity and mortality. METHOD A retrospective study of 155 patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension treated by means of the Sugiura-Futawaga operation was conducted to evaluate the complications related to splenectomy. RESULTS Mean age of the patients was 42 years: 81 patients were male and 74 female. In 87 cases liver cirrhosis was shown, 39 cases with portal fibrosis, 23 cases with primary biliary cirrhosis and 6 cases with normal liver (idiopathic portal hypertension). No patient received preoperative immunization against pneumococcus, but received antibiotic prophylaxis. Complications were found in 16 cases (10.3%): 13 of them related to the surgical procedure (peritonitis 3.9%, subphrenic collection 1.9%, pancreatic pseudocyst 1.9% and pancreatic fistula 0.6%) and three related to the absence of spleen (1.9%) with septic shock as manifestation. CONCLUSIONS The complications related to splenectomy in the Sugiura-Futagawa procedure are low, as well as the overwhelming post-splenectomy infection rate. Splenectomy in the Sugiura-Futagawa operation has no important role in the post-operative morbidity.</dc:description>
