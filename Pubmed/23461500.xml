<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the influence of the knowledge of the financial cost of the treatment and perception of the patient of his/her health status and the health care received from the Hospital Pharmacy Department (HPD). METHOD During a four-month period, from July to October of 2009, a questionnaire was provided to all the patients coming to the Hospital Pharmacy Department to gather their medications, except for those starting their therapies. The patients returning the completed questionnaire at a next visit were provided with the second part, in which they were informed on the monthly cost of their treatments and some questions from the main questionnaire were asked again. RESULTS 682 questionnaires were provided, of which 240 (35.3%) were returned completed. 223 patients were given the second part, of which 151 (22.1%) were returned. In general, the patients were satisfied with their treatments (90.4%) and with the care provided at the HPD (95.4%), 69.2% had good knowledge of their treatment, and 59.2% considered themselves as good compliers, and 17.5% did not usually consult with the pharmacist at the HPD. The patient's satisfaction analysis before (7.75; SD: 1.90) and after knowing the treatment cost (7.80; SD: 1.91) did not show statistically significant differences, with the exception of those patients derived from the Infectious Disease Department (p = 0.015) that were less satisfied after knowing the cost. CONCLUSIONS The knowledge on the treatment cost could not be related in general with changes in the attitude of the patients towards their treatments, being necessary the design of more profound studies. Besides, it should be recommended to undertake the improvement actions detected by the patients in order to increase the quality of the pharmacy care delivered.</dc:description>
