<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the long term outcome of surgical treatment for displaced ankle fractures in patients over 65 years of age, and determine the influence of age and comorbidity in the occurrence of complications. MATERIAL AND METHOD Retrospective descriptive study on 40 patients, with a mean age of 72.7 years (range: 65-88), who underwent open reduction and internal fixation for the treatment of a displaced ankle fracture. The patients were clinically evaluated according to the AOFAS criteria (functional outcome). Data collection also included the presence of comorbidities, radiographic evaluation, the occurrence of postoperative complications, and a questionnaire on satisfaction with treatment received. The mean follow-up was 5.73 years. RESULTS At the end of the follow-up, according to the AOFAS criteria, excellent/good results were obtained in 75% of the patients (n=30), with 38 patients referring to be quite/very happy with the result. Wound skin problems and metal work migration were the most common post-operative complications. No statistically significant relationship was found between increased age or a high number of comorbidities and an increased occurrence of postoperative complications (p&gt;.05). Only 3 patients needed postoperative rehabilitation, and 95% of the patients (n=38) returned to their activities of normal daily living. CONCLUSIONS Surgical treatment of displaced ankle fractures in the elderly patient facilitates the early resumption of the activities of daily living.</dc:description>
