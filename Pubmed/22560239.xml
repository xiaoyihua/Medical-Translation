<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify the attributes used by chronically-ill patients to describe physicians' competence in the public healthcare system in Andalucia. METHODS A total of 147 chronically-ill patients and their relatives were included in this qualitative study. Focal groups and in-depth interviews were performed in health centers and outpatient centers in Granada, Malaga, Seville, Cadiz and Cordoba between 2007 and 2008. Content analysis was carried out using Nudist Vivo. RESULTS The participants defined medical competence as combining elements of technical ability and knowledge (awareness of and interest in the disease, continuity of follow-up and requesting specific tests) with interpersonal skills related to communication, information (informing, listening, trust, prompting questions) and attention (courtesy, cordiality, respect, interest and approachability). Primary care was expected to provide a close relationship, personalized treatment, information, drug prescription, and referral to specialized care. Specialized care was expected to provide an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, information and follow-up. Highly valued aspects of emergency care were symptom relief, accurate diagnosis, referral to specialists and courtesy. CONCLUSIONS Chronically-ill patients based their evaluation of medical competence on technical and interpersonal skills.</dc:description>
