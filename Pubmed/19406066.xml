<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The aim was to determine whether prior coronary stent implantation affects postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. METHODS Between January 2005 and April 2008, a retrospective analysis was carried out to evaluate the effect of prior coronary stent implantation in patients undergoing off-pump coronary surgery on the incidence of major cardiovascular events in the postoperative period (i.e. at 30 days or during postoperative hospitalization). RESULTS In total, 796 consecutive patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Of these, 116 (14.6%) had a coronary stent at the time of surgery. Patients with and without stents had similar levels of risk (i.e. EuroSCORE). Multivariate analysis, adjusted for the presence of confounding variables (i.e. preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%, critical preoperative state, age, history of cerebrovascular accident, recent acute myocardial infarction, number of diseased coronary vessels, incomplete revascularization and on-pump conversion), showed that the presence of a stent was significantly associated with increased risks of postoperative myocardial infarction (relative risk [RR]=3.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75-5.96), in-hospital cardiac mortality (RR=4.62; 95% CI, 1.76-12.11) and in-hospital all-cause mortality (RR=3.65; 95% CI, 1.60-8.34). CONCLUSIONS In our experience, coronary artery stent implantation prior to coronary surgery was associated with increased risks of postoperative myocardial infarction, cardiac mortality and all-cause mortality in the postoperative period.</dc:description>
