<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Multiple sclerosis is one of the commonest idiopathic inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system in young adults. The study of the natural history of multiple sclerosis implies in the first place, establishing precise limits for the diagnosis of the disease, which is still of unknown origin. It is also necessary to analyze the wide range of varieties, which as different categories or subgroups and with different degrees of severity, make up the clinical spectrum of this entity. DEVELOPMENT AND CONCLUSIONS Throughout this review benign and malignant multiple sclerosis, remitting and progressive forms, are studied from epidemiological and clinical points of view in the context of large populations of patients with multiple sclerosis on long-term follow up at a specialized centre, with the objective of finding, if possible, the patterns of the natural history of the disease.</dc:description>
