<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Epidemiological studies indicate that obesity is associated with an increased risk of 20-25% with several types of cancer. OBJECTIVE The frequency of chromosome aberrations was evaluated in lymphocytes from postmenopausal obese and non-obese women. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty obese and 20 non-obese women, all post-menopause, were recruited. The groups were matched according to age (± 5 years) and place of origin. After signing the consent form, women were interviewed using a structured questionnaire, and a blood sample (5 ml) was drawn into vacutainer tubes. From each sample, lymphocyte cell cultures were established with and without mitomycin C (challenge assay). Afterwards, the frequency of chromosome aberrations were recorded for each group and treatment. Data were analyzed using the statistical program SPSS, v. 14.0. RESULTS Obese women had a higher frequency of chromosome aberrations when compared with non-obese women. After exposing the cell cultures to mitomycin C, obese women presented an increase in the number of total chromosome aberrations in comparison to non-obese women (3.7± 0.6 vs. 2.70±0.6; p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS The higher frequency of chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes from postmenopausal obese women compared to non-obese women suggested differences in the DNA repair capacity. This may indicate an association between genomic instability and the higher incidence of cancer in this population.</dc:description>
