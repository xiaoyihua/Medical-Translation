<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Postoperative atrial fibrillation is a common complication of carrying out cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC). The aim of this study was to determine whether preoperative left atrial contractile dysfunction, as assessed by tissue Doppler echocardiography, is associated with the development of postoperative new-onset atrial fibrillation (PAF). METHODS Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography was performed preoperatively in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Left atrial contractile function was evaluated by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of the mitral annulus. RESULTS The study included 92 patients in sinus rhythm preoperatively who underwent elective cardiac surgery with ECC: 73 (79%) were male and 19 (21%) were female, and their mean age was 67 (10) years. Of these, 19 (20.6%) developed PAF 34 (12) h postoperatively. Bivariate analysis showed that PAF was associated with older age (71 [7] years vs 66 [10] years; P=.034), a large left atrial diameter (LAD), and a low peak atrial systolic mitral annular velocity (A velocity) and a high mitral E/A ratio on TDI. Logistic regression analysis showed that PAF was independently associated with a large LAD (odds ratio [OR] =2.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-4.76; P=.033) and a low A velocity (OR=0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.99; P=.034). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative left atrial dysfunction, as assessed by TDI, was associated with an increased risk of PAF.</dc:description>
