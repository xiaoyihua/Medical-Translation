<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a syndrome that manifests atherothrombotic systemic atherosclerosis. Detection during preclinical stages (silent) may help to identify individuals and populations at risk (elderly patients) for atherothrombotic disease (stroke or coronary). METHODS We carried out an observational study approved by the investigation committee which, through a simple random method, included patients &gt;50 years admitted to the emergency room. After signing an informed consent, ankle-brachial index (ABI) was determined and patients were interviewed about risk factors, as well as specifying the reason for consultation. Descriptive statistics and χ(2) were used for analysis. RESULTS There were 100 patients; 53% were female. Average age was 67.05 ± 10.26 years and 54% of patients had ABI values considered as mild PAD. None had higher levels of severity. Inferential analysis showed a significant association with history of heart disease, renal failure, dyslipidemia, smoking and obesity, as well as the causes of admission of stroke and acute myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of silent PAD in this population is higher than most reports. PAD was significantly associated with higher atherothrombotic syndromes and it will be necessary to establish appropriate preventive actions to limit its development.</dc:description>
