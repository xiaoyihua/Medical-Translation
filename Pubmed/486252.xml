<dc:description xml:lang="en">The serum of 50 patients between 25 days to 15 years old who were admitted with the diagnosis of pertussis syndrome were investigated for precipitating antibodies by means of discontinuous counterimmunolectrophoresis (CIED). The presence of antibodies for Bordetella pertussis antigen was shown in 28 cases. All samples were taken within the first 24/48 hours of admission and at convalescence. The technique is easy to carry out, quick and of low cost. This test offers an adequate and fast means to differentiate a Bordetella pertussis syndrome form others produced by different viral etiologies. Besides, this serologic technique shows earlier results and of lower cost than classic techniques such as agglutination and complement fixation which are more difficult to apply.</dc:description>
