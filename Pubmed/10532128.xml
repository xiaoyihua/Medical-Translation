<dc:description xml:lang="en">The experience with seven cases of non-parasitic liver cyst, seen in a seven year period, (between 1992 to 1998) at the "Hospital Español" of Veracruz is presented. Clinical symptoms and signs are described, being the main one upper abdominal pain due to the size of the cyst and the compression over different organs. The diagnosis was made by images obtained from ultrasound and CT scan. The cyst average size was 14 cm, and in 28.57% of them, other small cysts were found. The surgical treatment included resection of the superficial capsule of the cyst and the electrocoagulation of the residual inner capsule. The procedure was performed using laparoscopic techniques. There were no surgical incidents, neither post-operatory complications or mortality. The clinical evolution of all patients was successful. We found some evidence from the international literature about the laparoscopic techniques in these patients. Our results were similar to other reports. There are no previous reports in the Mexican literature about this surgical technique in the management of the non-parasitic liver cyst disease.</dc:description>
