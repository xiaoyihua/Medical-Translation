<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this article we analyze education and employment policies for medical doctors in Mexico, which have led to a situation characterized by unemployment, under-employment and multiple-employment in urban areas, as well as lack of services in several rural zones. The analysis is divided into four defined periods according to the modes of State participation in health care: 1917-1958 (creation and slow growth of health care institutions); 1959-1967 (growth of scientific medicine); 1968-1979 (crisis period); and 1980-1988 (reform). In each one of these periods the evolution of medical manpower is analysed through the actions of three main actors: the State, the universities and the medical profession. The general conclusion of this historical analysis is that the present imbalance in the medical labor market has derived from a lack of joint planning of supply and demand, where by the educational and health care institutions, could decide together the crucial aspects of the quantity and quality of doctors that the population requires.</dc:description>
