<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The reoperation is considered as the access to the abdominal cavity before complete healing of the surgical wound from a previous operation within the first 60 days after the first procedure. It occurs in 0.5 to 15% of patients undergoing abdominal surgery and generates significant increase in morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. OBJECTIVES Identify the number of unplanned abdominal surgical reoperations and identify the causes of these unplanned reoperations were performed in our department. METHODOLOGY This is a retrospective study conducted at the University Hospital of Puebla in the period between April 2009 to February 2012, a total of 1,709 abdominal surgeries performed by the Service of General Surgery were included. RESULTS Ninety-seven cases of reoperation of which 50 cases were not planned surgery cases were identified; 72% (36 cases) from emergency operations, and 28% of elective surgery. CONCLUSIONS The incidence found in our study is low compared to similar studies. Prospective studies and focus on risk factors and causes of unplanned reoperations are required, in order to know them in detail and, consequently, reduce its incidence and morbidity and mortality they add.</dc:description>
