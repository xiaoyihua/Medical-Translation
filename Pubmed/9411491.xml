<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIDS is a complex illness due to HIV type 1 and 2 infection. It is characterized by an important immunodeficiency mainly caused by depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes. The reasons for this depletion have not been sufficiently clarified yet. In 1986, Shy Ching Lo astonished the scientific community with reported evidence concerning the direct role played by mycoplasma in the etiopathology of AIDS. Since then, different theories have pointed to mycoplasma as cofactors, commensals or opportunistic agents. Although in vivo and in vitro experiments are controversial they suggest a possible mechanism that would explain the synergism between both agents: the mycoplasma belonging to normal intestinal flora could move to urethra, oropharynx or blood due to high risk sexual practice. There it would proliferate favoured by early immunological disorders related to HIV. It has been speculated that several microorganisms including mycoplasma, acting as superantigens, could induce a chronic CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes activation resulting in apoptosis of the infected lymphocytes. The release of cytokines induced by mycoplasma could influence the progression of the disease.</dc:description>
