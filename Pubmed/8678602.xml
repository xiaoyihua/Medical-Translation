<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To report our experience in the surgical treatment of urinary fistulas. METHOD The clinical records of the patients seen during the period 1988-1991 were reviewed. RESULTS Sixteen cases of urinary fistulas were found; most of these had been caused during a gynecological procedure. All cases were treated by surgery, which achieved a satisfactory result in 100% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS Abdominal hysterectomy was the most frequent cause of urinary fistula. The most common was vesico-vaginal fistula, predominantly located in the upper portion of the trigone. The surgical technique most commonly utilized was transvesical fistulectomy.</dc:description>
