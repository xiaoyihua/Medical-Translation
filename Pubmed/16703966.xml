<dc:description xml:lang="en">Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity-mortality around the world. Nicotine dependence (ND) explains why people continue to smoke even though the harmful outcome associated with tobacco use is well-known. The object of this review was to establish current and one-year prevalence of ND among adults from the general population. Ebsco, Embase, Lilacs, Ovid, Proquest, and PubMed were systematically reviewed. The key words used were: smoking, tobacco, cigarette, nicotine, dependence, adults, general population and cross-sectional study. Only research carried out in English, Portuguese and Spanish was reviewed. A descriptive analysis of six articles was made. Current ND prevalence ranged from 27.8% to 55% (44.7% weighted average) and annual prevalence from 26% to 46.9% (37.7% weighted average). ND was independent of gender and higher amongst heavy smokers. It was concluded that ND prevalence is close to 45% amongst current regular smokers and affected 38% of smokers during the last year. More research is needed.</dc:description>
