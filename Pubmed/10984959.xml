<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cysts of the thyroglossal duct are one of the most common causes of benign neck masses. They generally occur in young patients and are caused by a defect in thyroglossal duct closure, which sometimes is in close contact with the hyoid. Often several tracts are present. The most effective surgical procedure was originally described by Sistrunk in 1920 and modified in 1928. This technique is based on the removal of the central portion of the hyoid bone. This procedure has successfully reduced the number of recurrences compared to local excision of the cyst. A retrospective review was made of 58 cases to evaluate surgical results, especially recurrence rate, in relation to the resection or preservation of the hyoid bone. Results were compared with published series.</dc:description>
