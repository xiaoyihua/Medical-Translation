<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine whether the features of adenomas identified in a first endoscopic examination may predict the presence of polyps with advanced pathological features that may have gone unnoticed and whether early colonoscopy may benefit these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We examined 133 patients with diagnosis of colonic adenomas who had undergone complete colonoscopy and endoscopic polypectomy. All of them underwent colonoscopic follow-up at 3 years. Seventy nine patients underwent colonoscopic follow-up both at 6 months and at 3 years, while 54 patients underwent just colonoscopic follow-up at 3 years and 47 just at 6 months. RESULTS Fifteen per cent of the patients analyzed developed polyps with pathological features after 6 months. The size and histological analysis of the polyps detected in the initial colonoscopic examination did not affect these results (p &lt; 0.05). The number of polyps was statistically significant: patients with 3 or more polyps in the initial colonoscopic examination presented more polyps with pathological features after six months (25.8 versus 5.8%, p = 0002). This follow-up examination at 3 years did not reveal a higher occurrence of polyps with pathological features in any of the two groups of patients, namely, those who had undergone early colonoscopy and those who had not. CONCLUSIONS Patients with multiple polyps have greater probability of developing synchronous polyps with some pathological features which may have gone unnoticed. Since early examination has not shown to provide a benefit for these patients, the first follow-up colonoscopy should be performed at 3 years, particularly if the initial colonoscopy is negative.</dc:description>
