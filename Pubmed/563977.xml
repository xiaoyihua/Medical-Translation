<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two cases of subcutaneous abscesses due to dematiaceous fungi are presented. The first, localized in the elbow, exhibited the characteristic microscopic picture of the disorder. The second was localized in the sole, but histologically it showed well-organized mycotic granules much like those reported for eumycetoma. Both patients were asymptomatic and the clinical diagnosis was erroneous. The morphologic, clinical and etiologic aspects are discussed in the text. These cases indicate the need to consider mycotic infections in the differential diagnosis of all lesions which clinically resemble subcutaneous abscesses, so that proper mycological studies can be done and the relationship between the process and the various etiologic agents implicated can be clarified.</dc:description>
