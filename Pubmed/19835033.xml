<dc:description xml:lang="en">The study of gender and its effects on mental health is a fascinating and growing field of clinical research aimed at obtaining benefits for both men and women. The exclusion of women in most clinical studies has resulted in significant gaps in our knowledge about the effects of disease and treatments in women. We try to understand how the disease develops as a result of a complex matrix of factors that affect each patient. One of these factors is the genre. Many other factors also play a role, as recent experiences and early life, the availability of social support or genetic influences. This article provides some ideas on the relationship between gender and vulnerability to mental disorders. It is an historical overview of the evolution of gender and its impact on mental health, and its inclusion in the DSM. An analysis documented through recent publications, and a look towards the next version: the DSM V.</dc:description>
