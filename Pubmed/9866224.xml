<dc:description xml:lang="en">A study was made of the differential features of transglottic laryngeal carcinomas. We made a retrospective study of patients with laryngeal carcinoma diagnosed in our center from 1985 to 1996. In this period, 1212 laryngeal carcinomas were diagnosed, of which 99 (8%) were considered transglottic. In relation to factors such as sex, toxic habits, level of histological differentiation or affected nodes, patients with transglottic carcinomas had characteristics that were intermediate between patients with glottic and supraglottic carcinomas. An analysis was made of the treatments and the results obtained in patients treated with radical intention and a minimum follow-up of 3 years. The treatment most frequently used in patients with transglottic carcinoma was surgery (total laryngectomy) and complementary radiotherapy. The 5-year actuarial adjusted survival rate jor patients with transglottic carcinoma was 78%, which was intermediate between the survival rates of patients with glottic (90%) or supraglottic (69%) carcinoma.</dc:description>
