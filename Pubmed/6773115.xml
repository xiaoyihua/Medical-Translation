<dc:description xml:lang="en">A new anthropometric rate called energy/protein ratio (E/P) which results from the division of the logarithmic transformation of tricipital skin fold (F) by the logarithm of branchial muscle circumference (BMC) is described. In a study of a sample of healthy preschool children from 97 day-care centers of the Havana City it was proved a relationship between adiposity and the muscular mass of the arm middle third which depends on age, sex and race and is normally distributed. Percentiles for each age and sex were obtained and it was confirmed the dependence of age and differences in each sex. It was also proved the quality of E/P in assessing variations of the muscular mass as well as a relationship between energy and protein storages. The E/P ratio is a new contribution to nutritional evaluation since it offers a new approach for the use of arm measurements, specially the tricipital fold, and demonstrates the easiness for its obtention and its reliability. The ratio may be applied either to individual assessment or to field studies. Measurements may be performed by well trained personnel, which may record the primary data and screen initially according to the percentile distribution of the values obtained. The E/P ratio may be obtained by a computerized program or a nomogram designed to that purpose.</dc:description>
