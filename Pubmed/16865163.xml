<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Establishing the clinical pathological characteristics of adenocarcinomata of the esophagogastric junction of an insured population in our environment. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this retrospective study, we studied sixty clinical histories of patients with a diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinomata, who had been surgically treated at the Edgardo Rebagliati Martins Hospital, 3C II Department of Surgery, EESALUD , Lima, Peru, from September 2002 to December 2004, and cases located at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) were selected. Data were collected regarding: age, gender, presentation symptoms, anatomic location of the tumor, regional lymphatic metastasis (N), distance metastasis (M), TNM staging, excisability, complications, mortality and histological type. RESULTS Distribution according to anatomic location: 50% (30/60) were located at the esophagogastric junction, 23% (14/60) in the body and 27% (16/60) in the antrum. Of the 30 patients with adenocarcinomata of the EGJ, 80% (24/30) were male, 60% (18/30) were in their 60's or 70's and 47% (14/30) had upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH). Type III tumors (subcardial) of the EGJ were found in 76% (23/30), in 63% (12/19) of the excised patients the serosa was affected, in 74% (14/19) the ganglia were affected and 83% (25/30) fell into stages III through IV. Excisions were performed on 63% (19/30), 42% (8/19) experienced complications, mortality was 10.5% (2/19) and in 67% (20/30) the histological type was clearly differentiated. CONCLUSIONS At our Hospital there seems to be an increase in the frequency of adenocarcinomata of the esophagogastric junction at the expense of other locations. Also, the subcardial type is more frequent than the cardial and distal esophagus types.</dc:description>
