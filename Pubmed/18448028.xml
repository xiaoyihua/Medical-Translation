<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The frequency of haemorrhoid disease and the deterioration in the quality of life in the immediate post-operative period has led to the appearance of new techniques in an attempt to obtain improve patient satisfaction. PATIENTS AND METHOD A prospective study was carried out in which 50 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of Goligher grade III haemorrhoids were intervened. To perform the haemorrhoid dearterialisation, a device called THD R was used (designed by TKC SRL and distributed by Palex Medical). The technique consisted of, a reduction in arterial flow using ligation of the terminal branches above the anorectal ring, starting in the anterior position, it was carried out in a clockwise direction: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Follow up was carried out at one week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. RESULTS We intervened 50 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of grade III haemorrhoids. The mean age was 45 years (range, 25-78). The surgical indication was, pain-discomfort, 40 (80%); bleeding, 35 (70%), prolapse 6 (12%). The procedure was always performed under local/regional anaesthesia. The mean duration of the procedure was 25 minutes (range, 20-35). Analgesia was required by 90% of the patients during the first 24 hours, decreasing to 15% for those who continued to require it until the third day and only 2 (4%) patients continued for one week. Pain was resolved 48 hours after surgery, in all patients who consulted for this reason, except for one patient (2.5%) who had a recurrence in the pain as well as in his prolapse. This meant that patients could re-start their daily living within 48-72 hours. CONCLUSIONS Pending for randomised studies, we can say that in our experience, Doppler guided transanal haemorrhoidal dearterialisation is a technique that should be offered to the patient with haemor-rhoidal disease.</dc:description>
