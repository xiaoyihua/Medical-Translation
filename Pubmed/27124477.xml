<dc:description xml:lang="en">Informed consent is the process of communication between the professional (medical staff and/or investigator) and patient culminating in the decision regarding a particular intervention. However, in our country the concept of informed consent is usually limited to the document that must be signed by the patient to undergo diagnostic or therapeutic procedures riskier. This consent is best understood as a process rather than an event, and also it usually gives consent on care processes rather than on specific events: the acceptance of a process involves a tacitly acceptance of the different components that are usually part of this process. There are many steps in the care process in which a simple permission could be enough, not needing a specific and formal consent... finally, contrary to the usual practice, the acceptance document of consent should be short, clear and understandable, flexible, and with the ability to adapt to the circumstances and the patient's wishes as far as possible and, all in an atmosphere of trust and verbal information that enables the patient, not forced to confront all the information, to delegate decisions on the professional.</dc:description>
