<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In July 2010 end stage renal disease anemia correction was incorporated to the program of explicit health guaranties of the Ministry of Health. The treatment plan included intravenous iron and erythropoietin. The prescription of these medications carne from the deriving health organizations. AIM To describe the results of that program in 11 dialysis facilities belonging to Fresenius Medical Care (a private organization) distributed in the six Metropolitan Health Services (MHS) in Santiago, Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS We selected 328 patients who remained in dialysis treatment at least between June 2010 and March 2011 and had a packed red cell volume lower than 30%, representing the target of the Plan. The evolution of packed red cell volume and the proportion of anemic patients in the facilities from each MHS were evaluated. RESULTS The two above mentioned variables began to improve only in December 2010. In no MHS, with the exception of the Eastern MHS, the mean hematocrit improved to higher than 30%, nor was the proportion of anemic patients reduced to lower than 50%. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of anemia of end stage renal disease in dialysis, implemented by the explicit health guaranties program of the Ministry of Health, was ineffective in almost all MHS in Santiago.</dc:description>
