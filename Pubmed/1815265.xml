<dc:description xml:lang="en">Yersinia was investigated in 50 skin samples of chicken carcasses from retail shops and 65 samples of balanced food for domestic fowl. Enrichments were performed in saline phosphate buffer 0.067 M, pH 7.6 and post-enriched in 0.5% KOH. Subcultures were performed in Salmonella-Shigella agar and MacConkey agar. Isolates were identified through biochemical, serological and lysotyping methods. The following biovar (B), serovar (O) and phagovar (Lis) were isolated from chickens: Y. enterocolitica (five strains) B:1:O:6,47;Lis Xz; B:1;O:6:Lis Xz; B:1:O:5,Lis Xz; Y.intermedia (two strains) B:1;O:52;Lis Xz; B:1;O:52,53,54;Lis Xz (NRA, nitrate reductase type A); Y. frederiksenii (two strains) O:10,K1,25,35,38,46:Lis Xz; (citrate): O:10,K1,25,35,38,46:Lis Xz (ONPG-: citrate +); Y. kristensenii (one strain) does not agglutinate; Lis Xo. Yersinia were not isolated from balanced food for domestic fowl. Virulence tests (calcium dependency and autoagglutination at 37 degrees C) were negative in all instances. It is concluded from this study that Yersinia isolated from chickens are without pathogenic importance.</dc:description>
