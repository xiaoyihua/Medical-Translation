<dc:description xml:lang="en">In 1998, a dengue outbreak (serotype 2) occurred in Salta province in Northern Argentina, following the first detection of dengue in the same area in 1997. We classified the serologic response of cases from 1998 as primary or secondary, since the risk of severe disease is greater for secondary cases. We studied 154 cases by plaque reduction neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests. Thirty-eight cases (25%) were classified as primary serologic responses and 84 cases (54%) as secondary responses. Thirty-two cases (21%) with borderline IgG titers could not be classified. Previous exposure to potentially cross-reacting flaviviruses (Saint Louis Encephalitis [SLE] and Yellow Fever [YF] viruses) was analyzed, as a possible cause of the secondary response pattern. Our results indicated that among cases classified as dengue secondary response, 83% could be attributed to previous SLE or YF exposure or serologic cross-reactivity. Vaccination against YF virus was at most a minor contributor to the secondary response pattern. The finding of a positive YF serologic result among persons not vaccinated may indicate silent circulation of YF in a region that can support both urban and jungle cycles. Other cases showing dengue secondary responses remained unexplained, suggesting the unrecognized occurrence of a previous infection with other dengue serotypes or of flaviviruses other than SLE or YF.</dc:description>
