<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Despite the high prevalence of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) reported, little information is available about this disorder in Spain. The present study was conducted to obtain information on this condition from patients identified by a simple screening questionnaire and subsequent diagnostic confirmation by the Primary Care Practitioner (PCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS Three-stage, cross-sectional and retrospective (resource utilization), observational study in a sample of adult patients (2,047 subject) attending 10 outpatient Primary Care centers in Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. A screening questionnaire containing the 4 RLS diagnostic criteria was used. Clinical assessment and RLS diagnosis confirmation was performed using a structured questionnaire. Other variables assessed were quality of life by SF-36 questionnaire scoring; sleep by the MOS sleep scale; symptom severity of RLS symptoms by the IRLS scales; health care resource utilization in the previous 12 months by completion of questionnaire following patient chart review. The diagnosis made by the PCP was confirmed in a small sample of patients by a neurologist expert in Movement Disorders. RESULTS A total of 19.7% (404 out of 2,047) subjects positively answered the 4 diagnostic questions of the RLS screening questionnaire. Of these, 185 (9.0%) reported moderate to severe symptoms at least twice weekly. The PCP made a diagnosis of RLS in 79 of 154 patients completing the diagnostic interview. Thus, prevalence of RLS estimated in this adult population was 4.6%. The predictive value of the screening RLS questionnaire was 51.3%. Average age of symptom onset was 42 years (range: 20 - over 80 years). RLS symptoms were moderately (50.6%) or extremely (38%) distressing and 73.4% of RLS patients slept poorly at least two nights a week. This diagnosis represents 9.4% of all patients presenting to PCP and experiencing poor sleep. Mean score in the IRLS scale (0 - 40) was 19.4. Average score of SF-36 questionnaire (0-100) was 54.6, lower than the Spanish general reference population (61.4). About one third of the RLS patients had seen a physician because of RLS symptoms. However, a diagnosis was made in only 48% of these and only 5% the diagnosis was RLS. CONCLUSIONS The DECODE RLS - Spain study shows that many patients with classical RLS symptoms frequently see their PCP without being adequately diagnosed and treated. Screening tools such as that used in this study may contribute to the detection of these patients.</dc:description>
