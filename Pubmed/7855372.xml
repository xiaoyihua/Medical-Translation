<dc:description xml:lang="en">Results of the Spanish Registry for Interventional Cardiology 1993 are presented, as previous years, by the Section of Haemodinamics and Interventional Cardiology of Sociedad Española de Cardiología. There are 72 participating cardiac catheterization laboratories. That represents 100% of those laboratories who had activity in 1993, Public medicine (51 centers) and Private practice (21 centers). From those, 8 laboratories exclusively performed pediatric cases. There have been performed 47353 diagnostic procedures and 2647 endomiocardial biopsies. In diagnostic cases greater proportion corresponds to coronariography (37591, 75.2%). Therapeutic interventionalism is also accomplished in 61 laboratories, on which 7807 balloon PTCA, 535 coronary atherectomies, 825 mitral valvotomies were performed, and 503 endocoronary prostheses were implanted. Mean rate of coronary interventionalism was 222 procedures by a million of inhabitants. This activity represents approximately a 17% increase from 1992, in diagnostic as well interventional procedures. Results of therapeutic cases did not show any significant changes, balloon PTCA primary success rate is 91.5%, with an incidence of 4.2% of complications that includes 0.7% mortality rate.</dc:description>
