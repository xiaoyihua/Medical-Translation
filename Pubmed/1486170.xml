<dc:description xml:lang="en">Endocarditis is the first manifestation of Q fever in its chronic form, generally affecting prosthetic cardiac valves or previously injured valves. Its clinical presentation is an endocarditis with negative culture and there is not agreement with regard to the most adequate antimicrobial treatment and its duration. Frequently, the valve has to be replaced. We present a case of a patient with double aortic lesion, in whom endocarditis by Q fever was diagnosed and treated with doxycycline, initially with success. However, she relapsed one year later, being then resistant to the medical treatment (doxycycline, ciprofloxacine plus rifampicine). It was not possible to replace the valve and the patient died two months later due to cardiac failure.</dc:description>
