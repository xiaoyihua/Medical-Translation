<dc:description xml:lang="en">Eighteen children with acute asthma were administered equal doses of Salbutamol either through a nebulizer and face mask or a dose-metered inhaler, spacer (Volumatic) and tidal breathing mechanism. Consecutive doses at twenty minute intervals were administered until either no significant improvement in pulmonary function was observed or until a cumulative dose of 0.15 mg/Kg (maximum of 5 mgs) had been given. All subjects finally received a dose of 0.15 mg/Kg (maximum of 5 mgs) of nebulized Salbutamol at the end of the study. No difference in bronchodilation was obvious between the methods of treatment. No significant side-effect was observed in any patient. Treatment of acute asthma in children with Salbutamol via a pressurized inhaler, spacer and tidal breathing mechanism may be an efficacious, safe and readily available method, but further work is needed before it can be recommended for routine home management of asthma attacks.</dc:description>
