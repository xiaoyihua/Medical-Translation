<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE BPPV localized in the horizontal semicircular canal is an infrequent entity. Nowadays there are controversies about the different treatments available. The objective of this study is to present our results. MATERIAL AND METHODS A multicenter and retrospective study was performed in 31 patients diagnosed of BPPV-HSC between January 1996 and May 2004. RESULTS cupulolithiasis was diagnosed in 48% on the patients. Symptoms disappeared before signs (p&lt;0.05). Global cure rate was 85%, while relapses were 16% at one year. No relations were found between cure rate and relapses and age, gender, duration of symptoms, canalithiasis and cupulolithiasis. CONCLUSION Our results support that there are not differences between the treatments performed in the BPPV-HSC. Symptoms disappeared before signs when canalith repositioning particles (CRP) maneuver was performed.</dc:description>
