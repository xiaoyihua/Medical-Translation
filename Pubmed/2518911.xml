<dc:description xml:lang="en">The results of a cross-sectional study for the evaluation of the prevalence of hypertension in the Baix Ebre region (Tarragona) are reported. 628 individuals from a randomly selected sample of 670 gave their consent to participate. The study was based on interview and examination at the patients home after getting an appointment by post. The prevalence of hypertension was 31.84 +/- 3.64%, and that of borderline hypertension 16.56 +/- 2.97%. Only 57% of hypertensives were previously known as such, and only 18.5% of these were being correctly treated. There was a significant association of hypertension with age (basically systolic blood pressure for women); also with alcohol intake, obesity and family history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. There was no significant correlation with sex, residence in rural or urban areas, emigration, marital status, occupational status, social and professional level, education, or with the coexistence of hypertension in the spouse. The high prevalence of hypertension was a remarkable finding, consistent with its recognized importance as a first rate health problem.</dc:description>
