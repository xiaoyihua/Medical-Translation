<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To study the possible correlation between the existence of postmicturition residual (PR), both in men as in women, with other urodynamic parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study in a series of 121 patients (33 male, 88 female), age X=68.22 and SD=12.904 (16-90 years), with a significative PR had been underwent a videourodynamic study. All cases of neurogenic vesicourethral dysfunctions and post pelvic radiotherapy were excluded. Statistical study was performed between the PR and the presence of urinary symptoms, urodynamic data, and findings of physical examination. The study was conducted, both descriptive and with statistical correlations. We used the Spearman Rho and compared with the median chi-square. RESULTS We found a positive correlation (men and women), between the PR and bladder capacity (p=0.001) and between the PR free flowmetry and PR test pdet/flow (r=0.450 p=0.001). In women, a positive correlation was found between the PR and the urethral resistance (URA) (p=0.001), and between PR and voiding by abdominal pressure (p&lt;0,05). We found a negative correlation in men between the PR and the parameters of detrusor contraction (W80-W20) (p&lt;0.05). Not found statistically significant correlation between the PR and cystometry, nor with the urodynamic diagnosis of obstruction, associated radiological semiology, hyperactive bladder and emptying symptoms in men. CONCLUSIONS The PR behaved more as a parameter measurement of detrusor contractility, than a parameter of the lower urinary tract obstruction. The PR was not associated with any clinic or associated radiologic semiology.</dc:description>
