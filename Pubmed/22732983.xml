<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The presence of binge eating disorder (BED) can influence the outcomes of laparoscopic gastric bypass (BPGL) in the treatment of morbid obesity. In English population, BED is assessed usually through the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-Revised (QEWP-R). OBJECTIVES To study validity and concordance of EDEQ and QEWP-R for diagnosis and psychopathologic assessment of BED in Spanish gastric bypass patients. METHODS In a cross sectional study 27 recent gastric bypass patients completed Spanish version of EDE-Q and QEWP-R. Then patients were classified in BED or no BED. We evaluated possible differences between these groups in the items with psychometric relevance and we measure concordance between the questionnaires. RESULTS The QEWP-R and EDE-Q identified respectively 25,9% and 18,5% patients with BED. These achieved higher scores in the items related to importance of weight or shape in self-assessment, interference in concentration because of thinking about food, shape or weight, and frequency of guilty feeling after eating. Diagnostic concordance was poor between questionnaires, but we found a strong relation between items with psychometric relevance. CONCLUSIONS BED is frequent in gastric bypass patients and constitute a distinct subgroup of patients with more severe psychopathology. Spanish version of QEWP-R and EDE-Q are suitable questionnaires for assessment of BED.</dc:description>
