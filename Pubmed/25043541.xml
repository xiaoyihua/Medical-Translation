<dc:description xml:lang="en">The treatment of patients with high cardiovascular risk and mixed hyperlipidemia is difficult due to multiple quantitative and qualitative lipid abnormalities. The priority is to reduce LDL-c levels, for which statins are the drug of choice. Despite the benefits of statins, the residual cardiovascular risk is very high in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. To reduce this risk, we also need to control non-HDL cholesterol levels, decreasing triglyceride levels and increasing HDL-c levels. To achieve these objectives and lifestyle changes, the use of combined therapy is often required. Fibrates are drugs that can be used in combination with statins to reduce this residual risk. Fenofibrate is well tolerated in combination with statins. The fixed combination of pravastatin/ fenofibrate has been shown to have complementary benefits in the atherogenic lipid profile in general. The combination is well tolerated and is indicated in patients with high risk and mixed hyperlipidemia who have controlled or are close to their objectives for LDL-c levels, using 40-mg pravastatin in monotherapy. The beneficial eff ect of the combination on LDL-c levels is minimal and is primarily observed in non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL-c. The combination of pravastatin 40 and fenofibrate 160 can provide a considerable clinical benefit to patients with high risk and mixed atherogenic dyslipidemia, to patients with LDL-c levels that are controlled or near the objectives for decreasing their residual risk of lipid origin and is especially useful for patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity and combined metabolic syndrome and familial hyperlipidemia.</dc:description>
