<dc:description xml:lang="en">Rates of allergic diseases such as asthma and rhinitis are on the rise as important health problems in every country of the world. Allergen specific immunotherapy with natural allergenic extracts is a treatment directed to changing the natural course of these diseases, and is a treatment that has reported beneficial effects in a majority of allergic patients. However, this treatment is difficult because of the complex composition of the extracts. The composition is difficult to standardize and, consequently, the risk of anaphylactic shock is increased; furthermore, sensitization can occur to other antigens present in the extract. Therefore, new allergen specific immunotherapy approaches are needed. Chemically defined and standardized antigens are more easily managed and provide a safer and more efficient treatment. Vaccines for immunotherapy have already been designed, based on recombinant allergens, variants (or peptides derived from them), that can be administrated alone or in combination with adjutants. Some of these preparations are indicated for facilitating the uptake and antigenic presentation by dendritic cells, or by targeting the mast cells and basophiles. Studies in vitro, in animal models and clinical trials in allergic patients, indicate that these preparations may provide protection against the allergen exposure and improve the symptoms by inducing the production of blocking antibodies of the IgE mediated response, production of regulator T cells and cytokines of Th1 profile.</dc:description>
