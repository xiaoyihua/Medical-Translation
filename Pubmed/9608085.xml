<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to present the use of retrograde colon enema in myelodysplasic patients with fecal incontinence. PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirty-three patients, 16 males and 19 females, 5 to 22 years old (average age 11.9 years) with spina bifida and fecal incontinence which obliged them to use a diaper. Retrograde colon enema procedures were performed in all of them. RESULTS With the use of the retrograde enema the best rectal emptying was achieved and kept 32 children (97%) diaper free after a follow-up period of more than two years. Only one girl (3%) needed pads because she was not able to defecate in an appropriate place after administering the enema. CONCLUSIONS The retrograde enema is the best conservative treatment for children with neurogenic fecal incontinence. This method achieves good rectal emptying allowing the children to be diaper free, resulting in better social adaptation and integration.</dc:description>
