<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the needs of the families of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the opinion of ICU professionals on aspects related to the presence of patient relatives in the unit. DESIGN A prospective descriptive study was carried out between March and June 2015. SETTING Polyvalent ICU of León University Healthcare Complex (Spain). PARTICIPANTS Two samples of volunteers were studied: one comprising the relatives emotionally closest to the primarily non-surgical patients admitted to the Unit for over 48hours, and the other composed of ICU professionals with over three months of experience in the ICU. INTERVENTION One self-administered questionnaire was delivered to each relative and another to each professional. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST Sociodemographic data were collected. The variables in the questionnaire for relatives comprised the information received, closeness to the patient, safety of care, the support received, and comfort. In turn, the questionnaire for professionals addressed empathy and professional relationship with the family, visiting policy, and the effect of the family upon the patient. RESULTS A total of 59% of the relatives (35/61) answered the questionnaire. Of these subjects, 91.4% understood the information received, though 49.6% received no information on nursing care. A total of 82.9% agreed with the visiting policy applied (95.2% were patient offspring; P&lt;.05). Participation on the part of the professionals in turn reached 76.3% (61/80). A total of 59.3% would flexibilize the visiting policy, and 78.3% considered that the family afforded emotional support for the patient, with no destabilizing effect. On the other hand, 62.3% routinely informed the family, and 88% considered training in communication skills to be needed. CONCLUSIONS Information was adequate, though insufficient in relation to nursing care. The professionals pointed to the need for training in communication skills.</dc:description>
