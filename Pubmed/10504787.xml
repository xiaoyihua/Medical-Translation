<dc:description xml:lang="en">Prospective and comparative study performed during 1997-1998. 1) PURPOSE: To estimate the blood lost trans-surgery. 2) To evaluate, with and without ferrotherapy, the hematic recovery degree, through the puerperium. Fifty women were involved, with a full, single and normal pregnancy to whom, in order to perform elective cesarean sections, underwent blocking epidural. We practiced a sequential determination of hemoglobin in all of them, through their staying hospitalized and during their puerperal control. The puerperas that left the hospital with hemoglobin under 11 g/dl, received oral ferroteraphy. The red formula outcomes were evaluated using percentage and descriptive statistics. The hemoglobin average displayed in g/dl were: a) Preoperative: 11.78, b) Postoperative: 10.39, c) At left hospital: 10.34, d) At 10 postoperative day: 11.72 and e) At 40 postoperative day: 12.86. The difference between preoperative and postoperative determinations, allow us to esteem, the trans-surgical blood average lost and his recuperation degree through the puerperium.</dc:description>
