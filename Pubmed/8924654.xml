<dc:description xml:lang="en">The records of 60 patients with gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) operatively treated between 1966 and 1993 at Belen Hospital, Trujillo, Perú, were retrospectively reviewed. The ratio of men to women was 1:7.5 and the average of age was 61 years. The accuracy of ultrasonography and oral cholecystograms for the specific diagnosis was 21% and 0% respectively. The surgical procedures employed were simple cholecystectomy (n = 56), right hepatectomy (n = 2). Whipple operation (n = 1) and extended cholecystectomy (n = 1), and our resectability rate for GBC is currently 50%. Simple cholecystectomy was a potentially curative surgical procedure in patients with in situ cancer (stage O) and early GBC (stage 1). In hospital mortality was 11.6% and 5-year survival rate for the total series was 15%. Gallstones were present in 95% of patients and most tumors (58%) had grown by diffuse infiltration or were associated with empyema (38%). Tumor stage, depth of invasion, tumor grade histologic type were all predictive of patient outcome. This report reinforces the difficulty in diagnosis and the poor prognosis for patients with GBC. We hold the view that more radical approaches for invasive cancers will enhance the operative results.</dc:description>
