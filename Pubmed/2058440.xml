<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ten cases of penoscrotal gangrene seen in our department over the last 8 years are presented. In 80% of patients causative factors of the gangrenous process were demonstrated and were equally distributed between urology and colorectal pathologies. The most commonly associated pathology was diabetes mellitus affecting up to 50% of our patients. Two or more germs were isolated from the necrotic-purulent material for cultures, mainly E. coli (90%) and Proteus mirabilis (50%) as aerobic organisms, and Bacteroides fragilis (40%) in the anaerobic group. Despite emergency surgical therapy and high doses of broad spectrum antibiotics, mortality in our series was about 20%.</dc:description>
