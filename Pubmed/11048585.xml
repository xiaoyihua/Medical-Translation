<dc:description xml:lang="en">The nutritional and microbiological quality of 80 soybean sausage samples (50% frankfurter and 50% sausage mortadela) was studied. On average, the protein content was 17.5 g/100 g in sausage mortadela and 20 g/100 g in frankfurter. The mean total fat content was 5.5 g/100 g for both products. However when products of different manufacture industries were compared, a highly significant difference (p = 0.0000) in the fatty acids speciation between both groups and between samples of the same product were found. Bigger differences were found in the content of palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2). Cholesterol was not detected in samples analyzed. On average the atherogenicity index was 0.55 for sausage mortadela and 0.59 for frankfurter. A consumption of 25 grams of of soybean protein from these sausages can bring an intake of saturated fatty acids between 20-90% of the daily recommendation. Likewise, they can supply between 12-70% of the recommended daily polyunsaturated fatty acids. These variations are owing to the big difference in fatty acids speciation in each sausage brand. Around 20% of soybean sausages studied showed total coliform levels above 10(4)/g, being more frequent in sausage mortadela. Also 60% of this product and 10% of frankfurters showed psychrotroph levels of 10(6)/g. Clostridium perfringens, in levels above 10(2)/g was evidenciated in 5% of samples, Escherichia coli was not isolated from them. The findings of this study suggest the urgent need for implementing a quality control system for soybean sausages, before national health authorities consider to support nutritional campainings that promote their consumption.</dc:description>
