<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Assessment of a real-time PCR technique for the detection and quantification of fungal DNA in a murine model of pulmonary aspergillosis. METHODS Male ICR specific pathogen-free mice were used in the studies. The animals were divided into groups: immunosuppressed and intranasally inoculated with various inoculum sizes (10(6), 10(5), 10(4), and 10(3) conidia/mL) of a clinical isolate of Aspergillus fumigatus. When symptoms of pulmonary aspergillosis were detected, the mice were killed and the lungs removed for culture and real-time PCR determination. The PCR reactions used primers that amplified a region of Aspergillus spp. ribosomal DNA. Survival time per experimental group was calculated and correlation coefficients with inoculum size, colony counts and PCR results were determined. RESULTS Average survival time was significantly associated with the size of the inoculum. Pulmonary colony count was positive for 90% of the infected mice, but there was no statistical relationship between count values and either survival time or inoculum size. Real-time PCR was positive in 100% of the animals and was significantly associated with survival time and inoculum size (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION Real-time PCR is a reliable procedure for the quantification and evaluation pulmonary infection due to A. fumigatus in animal models.</dc:description>
