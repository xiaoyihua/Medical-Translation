<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Psychological and biological symptoms occur in the perimenopausal period. However the real prevalence of these, is not well known in Chile. AIM To determine the prevalence of biological and psychological symptoms and self care sexual health practices of perimenopausal women of Temuco, Chile. PATIENTS AND METHODS A random sample of 171 women aged 45 to 55 years old, affiliated to private preventive health institutions and community organizations, were studied. These women were stratified in three income levels. Chi square, Fisher test and ANOVA were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Bone and muscle aches were the most frequent referred symptoms in 36% of women. Thirty one percent complained of vaginal dryness and 28% of headache. No differences in symptom frequency per age or between post or pre menopausal women, were observed. Depressive disorders were found in 39% of women, mostly in women not working outside their houses. In the previous two years, 67% of women had a PAP smear and 58% had a mammography performed. Women of low income levels had a greater prevalence of biological and psychological symptoms and a lower frequency of self care behaviors. CONCLUSIONS The most frequent symptom among the studied women was bone and muscle aches, followed by vaginal dryness. These results differ from other publications that report flushing as the most important symptom among perimenopausal women.</dc:description>
