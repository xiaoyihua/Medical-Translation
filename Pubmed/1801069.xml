<dc:description xml:lang="en">One hundred and sixty-four AIDS patients were studied; in 70 of them (42.7%) an agent capable of producing diarrhea was identified either by bacteriology, histopathology, or both procedures. It was observed that homosexuals and bisexuals present diarrhea sooner and with a higher frequency than heterosexuals. Cryptosporidium (35.7%) was the most frequently isolated agent. The most useful study was the coproparasitoscopic series. In 27 patients (38.6%) 2 or more agents (pathogens or opportunist) were isolated. An statistical correlation was demonstrated between the presence of diarrhea and the existence of agents able to produce it. The convenience of using special methods, because of their efficacy or cost, to evidence other pathogenic or opportunistic agents is also discussed.</dc:description>
