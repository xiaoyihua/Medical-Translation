<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To compare the severity of rotavirus diarrhea (RV) and non-rotavirus diarrhea. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between October 1994 and March 1995, a cross-sectional study was performed in 520 infants with acute diarrhea, at seven primary care level centers in five states of Mexico. Diagnosis of RV was done through immunoenzymatic assay or electrophoresis. Central tendency measures were used for data analysis. Results were presented as means and standard deviations, or median and variation. RESULTS RV was isolated from 264 children; most of them were males aged 6 months to 1 year. Differences in clinical manifestations were statistically significant between the rotavirus-positive group and the rotavirus-negative group, in the following variables: median number of stools/24 hours; frequency of vomiting; temperature &gt; 38 degrees C; dehydration; and clinical severity scoring. CONCLUSIONS These results showed a poorer prognosis and a higher severity of rotavirus diarrhea, as compared to non-rotavirus diarrhea in infants.</dc:description>
