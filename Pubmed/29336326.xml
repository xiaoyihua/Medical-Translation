<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Urology is a medicalsurgical specialty that deals with the study, diagnosis and treatment of medical and surgical conditions of the urinary tract and retroperitoneum in both sexes and of the male genital tract without age limit. The traditional method of training is based on the imitation of the skills and behaviors of the tutors, creating variability in the training between different centers and giving a passive role to resident internal physicians (MIR). LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK The 2006 BOE establishes the specific formative content in its theoretical, practical and scientific facets. At the beginning of the MIR training period, the first year focuses on general surgical training and the remaining four on specific urological training. The current legislative framework that regulates our specialty is one of the oldest, with no prospect of renewal, since this would be carried out with the development of the trunk project, currently paralyzed after the judgment of the Supreme Court. Therefore, we are in a situation of uncertainty with a legal framework in renewal plans. CURRENT STATE OF TRAINING: a National survey shows the degree of surgical participation of the MIR is low, as well as training on models and course attendance. In addition, the self-confidence they feel for interventions that could be considered of low complexity is high, for activities such as consultation is moderate and for interventions of moderate-high complexity is low. CONCLUSION The current training program is upgradeable. New studies and efforts should aim to standardize the acquisition of surgical and non-surgical skills, guarantee access to surgical training courses, establish a minimum of required interventions per year and at the end of residency, foster academic training, participation in research of residents and achieve an objective assessment of the specialty.</dc:description>
