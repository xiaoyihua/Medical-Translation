<dc:description xml:lang="en">Obesity is associated to a variety of endocrine abnormalities that might lead to chronic anovulation in women. Weight loss may improve the hormonal profile and then restore ovulation in some of them. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of a weight loss program on the clinical and hormonal characteristics of anovulatory obese women attending our reproductive clinic. We studied a group of 30 anovulatory obese patients between 18 and 35 years old without any thyroid disease. Before and after a weight loss of at least 5% of initial body weight we analyzed LH, FSH, estradiol, prolactine, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, oral glucose tolerance test and progesterone, weight, BMI, waist/hip ratio and total body fat percentage. The mean weight loss was 9.5 +/- 4.3 kg. which represents a weight loss of 10.96% from initial body weight, with 26 patients (86.6%) resuming spontaneous ovulation. The women's mean plasma testosterone, LH, estradiol and DHEA-S decreased significantly and there was significantly increased on progesterone. At the beginning a total of 12 patients showed an impaired oral glucose tolerance test and after weight loss 9 of them improved it. The results shown in this study demonstrate that even a small weight reduction and a decrease in total body fat percentage improve the hormonal profile and restore ovulation in anovulatory obese women. Thus weight loss should be considered before starting with ovulation induction therapy.</dc:description>
