<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The aim of this paper is to quantify, by means of bibliometric indicators, the scientific production of Spanish researchers and institutions publishing in national and international paediatric journals, as well as multidisciplinary and other knowledge areas publications during the period 2006-2010, and to determine their impact. METHODS The articles were obtained by applying specific search strategies in databases including, Science Citation Index-Expanded, Scopus, Índice Médico Español, and Índice Bibliográfico Español en Ciencias de la Salud. RESULTS A total of 7971 articles were published in 971 journals, in which 142 were from Spain and 829 were international. The most productive journals were Anales DE PEDIATRÍA (n=1257), Acta Pediátrica Española (n=456) and Evidencias en Pediatría (n=358). Articles were published mostly in English (41.04%) and in Spanish (38.18%), with the participation of 17 874 different authors from 3302 institutions. Approximately 60% of the papers were cited at least once, and 39.81% were never cited. The mean number of citations per document was 4.28 (SD=9.54). The most cited journals were Pediatrics (n=770), Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, and Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (n=553). DISCUSSION The number of articles progressively increased from 2006 to 2010, which confirms the consolidation and growth of Spanish pediatric research, where the results are published in a wide range of Spanish and international journals, among which stands out is the ANALES DE PEDIATRÍA, the only Spanish pediatric journal with an impact factor. The increasing internationalization of Spanish Pediatrics is also confirmed, since a sustained growth of articles published in international journals is observed, where a quarter was published in US or British journals, as well as the importance of the publication in English. There is a concern about the fact that almost 40% of the articles did not receive a citation, which should encourage authors to complete research of quality, and editors to start editorial policies addressed to increase manuscript and journal quality.</dc:description>
