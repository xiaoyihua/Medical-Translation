<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Radial head resection has been a widely used procedure in cases of non-reconstructable radial head fracture. Some authors propose the use of radial head arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of radial head resection for isolated fracture, without instability at the time of the fracture, and its radiological and functional repercussions at the elbow level. METHODS We reviewed 44 clinical records with acute resection of the radial head following isolated radial head fracture, with absence of associated injuries, younger than forty, with a minimum follow-up of 15 years. Information was collected on elbow pain, biomechanical function, flexion and extension elbow strength and elbow instability compared with the non-affected side. A radiological study was conducted on all patients to determine the presence of degenerative changes, calcifications and measurement of the carrying angle. Outcomes were evaluated with Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score as an instrument to measure the patient's perceived disability. RESULTS The group under study is made up of ten women and thirty-four men, with an average age at the time of fracture of 28.6 years (ranging from 15-40) and an average time since the fracture or follow-up time of 28.5 years (ranging from 16-38). The affectation was on the dominant side in thirty cases (23 right-handed and 7 left-handed). Thirty-nine patients (88.6%) had no elbow pain, and in all other cases was mild or moderate. Loss of mobility and strength was 1.5% for flexo-extension, 3.5% for prono-supination, 7.9% for flexion strength and 3.5% for extension strength. We appreciated four cases of valgus instability and two of postero-lateral instability. The average DASH score was 6.9 points. Radiographic changes of arthritis were present in 93.3% and 54.4% of calcifications. The mean increase of carrying angle was 7.7º compared with non-affected gide (ranking from 0.9-15.8º). CONCLUSION Radial head resection for isolated fracture in young patients presents satisfactory results, with very low losses of elbow mobility and strength. Despite the high presence of osteoarthritic changes or lower clinical signs of instability, elbow pain and disability are very low. Our conclusion, based in these results, is that radial head resection is still a useful surgical procedure for isolated fractures even in young patients.</dc:description>
