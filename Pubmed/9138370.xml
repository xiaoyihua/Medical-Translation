<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Felodipine is a calcium channel inhibitor with high vascular selectivity. AIM To study the effectiveness of felodipine in the treatment of essential hypertension in subjects older than 64 years old. PATIENTS AND OUTCOME Fifty subjects were studied. After a washout period of four weeks, subjects received a placebo for two weeks followed by the active drug given in an initial dose of 5 mg/day, adjusted to 10 and 20 mg every 21 days if normal blood pressure levels were not attained. RESULTS Compared to the placebo period, Felodipine treatment reduced blood pressure from 173 +/- 7.5/102 +/- 3.3 mm Hg to 158 +/- 6.3/91 +/- 4.2 mm Hg. There was no orthostatic reduction of blood pressure, and 87% of subjects attained systolic and diastolic pressure levels below 140 and 90 mm Hg respectively. Adverse reactions (edema, cephalea and flushing) were reported by 38% of subjects and in three, the drug was discontinued. There were no changes in laboratory parameters during the treatment period. Quality of life improved during treatment in the items of concentration, health status perception, mood, physical condition, depression, effects of hypertension on life events and initiative. CONCLUSIONS Felodipine is effective in the treatment of elders with essential hypertension.</dc:description>
