<dc:description xml:lang="en">Fifty staghorn calculi that had been removed surgically and previously analyzed for stone composition and structure were studied by tomodensitometry. The analysis consisted of measurements in absolute units and histographic configuration of x-ray attenuation-absorption of the lithiasic material. The reconstructed images were evaluated and the areas of interest were defined. Each section and area had the following universal elements: number of pixels studied and values for mean attenuation expressed as Hounsfield units (HU). In this manner, tomodensitometric mapping of the calculi could be performed. We underscore the usefulness of this procedure in investigation and the possibility of extrapolating the results to in vivo studies of calculi composition so that we can reliably predict the results attainable with treatment modalities such as ESWL or percutaneous surgery. Little has been published on this subject. To our knowledge, this is the first in Spain.</dc:description>
