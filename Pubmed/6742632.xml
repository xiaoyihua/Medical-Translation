<dc:description xml:lang="en">From 1977 to 1982, 13 children affected by craniostenosis involving the supraorbital ridge were treated by surgery and subsequently followed up. Six cases of plagiocephaly, one of brachycephaly, three of Apert's syndrome, and three cases of Crouzon's disease were operated on, employing in seven cases classical lineal craniectomies, an in six other, craniotomies with advancement and remodelling. The results obtained are discussed in terms of functional and cosmetic improvement, the therapeutic criterion being in terms corresponding with the gravity of the malformation and the age at which the surgical operation was carried out.</dc:description>
