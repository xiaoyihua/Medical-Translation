<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The current incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage in low-weight preterm infants is 20%. The percentage of patients who are going to develop hydrocephalus secondary to this haemorrhage varies greatly. In the last 20 years different medical and surgical treatments have been put forward to prevent both the occurrence of haemorrhage and the development of hydrocephalus. DEVELOPMENT In this study we review the literature on the different treatments used to control and treat hydrocephalus. From the medical point of view, treatment with pharmacological agents such as azetazolamide or furosemide offers more drawbacks than advantages as far as their capacity to prevent hydrocephalus is concerned. Treatments involving fibrinolytic agents offer a high risk of triggering new haemorrhages but in recent years their use has been taken up again in combination with ventricular drains. As regards surgical treatment of hydrocephalus due to haemorrhage, despite the risk of infection, it is more advisable to use ventricular drains than to introduce subgaleal reservoirs. At the present time, the best definitive treatment for hydrocephalus in preterm infants is still the ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The most suitable time is when the weight of the newborn infant exceeds 1500 g and the cerebrospinal fluid offers a protein count above 200 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS The long-term neurological development of these children depends mainly on the severity of the haemorrhage, but poorer prognoses are observed in cases in which complications arise from the control examinations of the valve shunt systems.</dc:description>
