<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors undertook an analysis of all the pediatric patients who presented at their hospital with scooter-related injuries. A total of 37 patients seen at Dr. Victorio de la Fuente Narváez Trauma Hospital were studied. Findings included a wide variety of injuries, from skull fracture to limb factures, as well as one open fracture and a chondral knee fracture. Diagnoses were made clinically and radiologically and various treatments were provided, both conservative and surgical. Findings showed a high frequency of scooter-related fractures in children. The use of protective equipment by children and their supervision are necessary to prevent these injuries.</dc:description>
