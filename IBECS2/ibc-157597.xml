<dc:title xml:lang="en">Effect of negative between-class training and structure training on formation of equivalence relations</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">The probability of equivalence class formation was assessed in three matching to sample procedures (standard, semi-standard, and linear series), and three training structures (one-to-many, many-to-one, and altered) in a 3x3 factorial design. The matching to sample procedures trained the same positive relations (sample-S+), but they differed in the kind of negative relations (sample-S-) that they trained. With the standard procedure only negative relations among stimuli of different classes (among-class relations) were trained; with the semi-standard procedure some among-class negative relations and others with stimuli that did not belong to any class (stimuli X) were trained; finally, with altered procedure negative relations only with X stimuli were trained. The baseline positive and negative relations were assessed, with trials with novel stimuli and a blank comparison stimulus. There was not an interaction effect between the matching procedure and the training structure. The standard procedure was superior to the semi-standard procedure, and the latter one was superior to the altered procedure in the formation of equivalence relations. The one-to-many training structure was superior to the linear-serial structure. The results suggest that the probability of equivalence class formation is positively related with the amount of negative among-class established by the training, and this effect is independent from the training structure (AU)</dc:description>
