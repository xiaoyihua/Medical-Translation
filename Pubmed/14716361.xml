<dc:description xml:lang="en">Prevention and treatment of osteoporosis consists of non-drug and drug therapy. This review of the topic will provide an overview of the approach to therapy of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In the past, estrogen replacement was considered a primary therapy for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, data from the Womeńs Health Initiative (WHI) revealed that estrogen-progestine therapy does not reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, and increases the risk of breast cancer, stroke, and venous thromboembolic events. As a result of these findings, other antiresorptive agents are now the drugs of choice for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.</dc:description>
