<dc:description xml:lang="en">Among the idiopathic interstitial lung diseases, respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD) and desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) make up a subgroup of rare diseases that are clearly smoking related. Few large case series have been published. We describe 19 cases registered in Spain: 12 patients with DIP and 7 with RB-ILD. Clinical and radiologic features are described along with clinical course, treatments applied, and outcomes. With the exception of 2 patients with DIP, all were smokers or ex-smokers. Cough and dyspnea were the most common symptoms at onset in both diseases. The most frequent radiologic findings were ground-glass opacity in DIP and pulmonary nodules in BR-ILD. Most patients were treated with corticosteroids. Outcomes were good in general; only 1 patient, with DIP, died.</dc:description>
