<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Analysis of blood lead levels in relation to the state of iron metabolism was carried out in children. METHODS A transversal study of blood lead levels was designed in 89 iron deficient children (serum ferritin &lt; 15 micrograms/l) (group F). Fifty seven of the children did not have anemia (sub-group FS) and 32 had anemia (sub-group AF) with ages ranging between 6 months and 14 years, and 41 children of the same age with normal iron metabolism (group C). A longitudinal study was also carried out by the determination of blood lead levels prior and after iron therapy in 18 of the iron deficient children. RESULTS A significant difference was seen between the mean of blood lead levels in iron deficient children (group F), 9.41 micrograms/dl and normal children (group C), 6.88 micrograms/dl (p &lt; 0.01). The mean of blood lead levels of the sub-group FS was 7.79 micrograms/dl and the sub-group AF, 12.30 micrograms/dl (p &lt; 0.01). The prevalence of lead poisoning (blood lead levels &gt; 20 micrograms/dl) was 8% in group F (2% in sub-group FS, 19% in sub-group AF) and 0 in group C (p &lt; 0.01). A significant decrease was found in the longitudinal study in the mean of blood lead levels following iron therapy from 14.12 micrograms/dl to 7.51 micrograms/dl (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The iron deficient state may constitute a predisposing factor of lead poisoning in childhood.</dc:description>
