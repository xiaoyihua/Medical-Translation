<dc:description xml:lang="en">A prospective, observational, comparative study of 100 patients with acute myocardial infarction and primary angioplasty was performed to establish if there was statistically difference between the lag of time when symptoms begin and the time of the emergency admission to the time of arrival at the catheterization suite during working hours vs the "on call" hours. Patients were allocated in two groups accordingly to morning hours or on call hours. Time of onset of symptoms to the catheterization suite arrival between the two groups was no significantly different. Time from emergency room arrival to catheterization suite arrival was significant different &lt; 0.05, however success rate between groups 86% vs 80% and complications rate were statistically non significant between both groups. We conclude that primary angioplasty is a highly effective method of reperfusion. Even though the time from the emergency room arrival to the catheterization suite arrival was significantly less during day than the on call hours, there is no difference between the success rate and complications incidence in both groups.</dc:description>
