<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To report a case of extrarenal Wilms' tumor, an uncommon site of presentation of this tumor type. The diagnostic and prognostic aspects of this condition are also discussed. METHODS/RESULTS A case of retroperitoneal extrarenal Wilms' tumor in a 2-year-old child is presented. The patient underwent surgery and received postoperative chemotherapy. At 3-years' follow-up, no evidence of metastasis has been observed. CONCLUSIONS Extrarenal Wilms' tumor is rare and has been reported in the literature principally as case reports. Its clinical presentation varies according to the extrarenal localization. The procedures utilized to determine the size of the primary tumor, regional node involvement and the presence of distant metastasis are similar to those utilized in Wilms' tumor of the kidney. Our results demonstrate the utility of chemotherapy; the cytostatic agents utilized appear to be as effective as in Wilms' tumor of the kidney. In our view, radiotherapy should be reserved for the large unresectable residual tumor mass and for distant metastasis.</dc:description>
