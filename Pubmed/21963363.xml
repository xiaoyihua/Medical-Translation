<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a rare paediatric disease of autoimmune origin. The aim of this study is to estimate its impact in our area over the past 10 years and to analyse the clinical, laboratory and radiological presentation, as well as study the response to treatment and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of cases diagnosed with current ADEM criteria. The age and month of the year at onset, sex, family history of demyelination, initial symptoms, disease or previous vaccination, CSF features, serology, PCR for herpes virus group in blood and CSF, oligoclonal bands in CSF, EEG and neuroimaging features of the skull by MRI, the type of treatment received and the response were recorded on each of the patients diagnosed. RESULTS There were 16 patients, with a mean age of 5.6 years. Male/female: 11/5, with a dominant debut in the colder months of the year, predominantly gait disorder, changes in consciousness and seizures. The radiology by MRI showed a predominance of multiple lesions in the same T2 stage, in deep white matter and lesions in deep grey matter. There were no in blood parameters and the CSF was normal in half of the cases. The origin was determined in 7 cases. CONCLUSIONS The annual incidence in children under 14 years was estimated at 0.64/100,000. The clinical and radiological findings were the basis of diagnosis. The human herpes virus 6 was involved in 4 cases. Most patients recovered completely.</dc:description>
