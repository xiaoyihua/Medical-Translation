<dc:description xml:lang="en">We are experiencing a social change in health that is unprecedented in the history of humanity. Modern sociology attempts to explain this change using concepts of reflexive modernisation, liquid life or society, or the end of history. This social change results in a new model of patient who is better informed and has greater expectations with respect to healthcare and health. More information does not mean better understanding and more responsibility with respect to health. For this to occur, it is necessary to increase the social and individual conscience of people as health agents and as responsible users. The University of the Patients emerges as a project directed towards increasing the health and civic literacy of the population and from the need to adapt the health systems to the new needs generated by a new model of user.</dc:description>
