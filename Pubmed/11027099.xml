<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify similar structural elements in the largest number possible of chemical agents which can induce Parkinsonism and study their relation with the main chemical changes seen in Parkinsonism. DEVELOPMENT We studied the chemical structure and structural relations of the chemical agents reported in the literature because of their ability to induce Parkinsonism. We observed the structural similarity of the majority of chemical agents and the structural discrepancy of the rest. The structural element identified as common had three clearly differentiated parts: a cyclic fragment, bridge fragment and nitrogen atom fragment. We studied the diversity of the parts of each fragment. We studied the relation of the common structural element with other biochemical components which are altered in Parkinsonism, and also the possible mechanism of action of the structural element in the process of induction of Parkinsonism. CONCLUSIONS There is a structural grouping close to the molecule of the dopamine neurotransmitter in most of the organic compounds which can induce Parkinsonism. Therefore, we suggest that the origin of certain Parkinsonian conditions may be due to changes in the natural equilibrium of dopamine due to the action of chemical agents with a suitable chemical substructure similar to that of dopamine.</dc:description>
