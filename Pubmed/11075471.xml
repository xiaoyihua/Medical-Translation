<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Suspension laryngoscopy by general anesthesia is the universally method of performing microlaryngeal surgery for the treatment of vocal cord polyps. Recently a new technique using a flexible endoscope with working channel has been introduced and popularized in Spain for treating these lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective study was undertaken to asses the efficacy of this technique, something modified, for removal either pedunculated vocal cord polyps or with minute implantation basis. RESULTS Twenty-six consecutive patients with pedunculated cord polyps were surgically removed, at the ENT-Department of Sierrallana Hospital (Torrelavega, Cantabria) from January 1995 till September 1996. In 4 patients with strong gang reflexes the procedure could not be finished. Twenty-two patients improved their voice and were satisfied with the result. In 2 other cases, of the group, the voice regain was not complete, but owing to the feelings of the individuals no more surgical procedures were scheduled. No postoperative aftermath were observed. One year later all cases were checked and all proclaimed their well-being. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that removal of pedunculated polyps of the vocal cord employing the fibroendoscope with working channel and local anesthetic should be the choix procedure for the lot of patients suffering this pathology, and the microsurgery with general anesthesia must be reserved for failure cases or for those patients using voice professionally.</dc:description>
