<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two techniques are utilized for renal biopsy (RB): open renal biopsy (ORB) and percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB). We reviewed 283 renal biopsies: 140 ORBs and 143 PRBs. The number of glomeruli obtained were 34.6 and 13.4, respectively. Sufficient biopsy material for the pathological analyses was obtained in 100% of the ORBs and 91% of the PRBs. These were diagnostic in 98.5% and 91%, respectively. The two groups were significantly different. Patients submitted to ORB had a worse general condition (analytically more uremic and anemic). The creatinine and urea values prior to RB were higher for the complicated ORB group versus the overall ORB group. Statistically, the complicated ORB group is related with hyperpotassemia and hypernatremia. The sodium values were higher and the urea values were lower for the complicated ORB group, although we believe the foregoing findings to have no clinical value. The remaining analytical studies were not different for the groups or subgroups of the present study.</dc:description>
