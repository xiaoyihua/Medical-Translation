<dc:description xml:lang="en">One hundred and sixty four (164) patients were evaluated. Sixty (60) with Sickle cell disease (SSHg.) and ninety seven (97) with Trait (ASHg.); seventeen (17) were normal control group. The study confirmed that the incidence of cardiomyopathy in Trait (ASHg.) is greater than reported by other clinical investigations. Cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, bundle branch blocks, and T and ST modifications with sub epicardial isquemia were most significant electrocardiographics changes. The possibility of myocardial infarction in SS patients with low or normal hemoglobin is significant. M-Mode and 2-D echo, demonstrated similar end diastolic volumes in AS and SS patients in which cardiomyopathy were diagnosticated. Patients with cardiac failure, treated with cardiotonics, diuretics and ACE were compensated most frequently. To prevent hemosiderosis, antioxydant (alfatocoferol and Ubiquinones) were used with satisfactory response.</dc:description>
