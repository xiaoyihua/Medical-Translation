<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJETIVE To determine the correlation between the presence of genetic anomalies identified in the RB1 gene and the development of trilateral retinoblastoma. METHOD No patients with primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET) were identified out of a total of 206 patients, but there were 17 cases of pineal cysts, of which 11 had a genetic study. RESULTS Of the 11 patients who had a genetic study performed, the anomaly in the germinal line was identified in 8 cases, which was equivalent to 100% of the bilateral retinoblastomas, and 25% of the unilateral ones. It is more common to find a germinal mutation in patients with bilateral disease (P=.024). There are no significant differences in the type of anomaly identified, although the nonsense-frameshift type is more frequent in cases with bilateral involvement. Identification of the genetic anomaly is more frequent in patients who have pineal cysts (Fisher test; P=.490). Nine of the 17 patients received systemic chemotherapy (52.29% of the cases), which could be able to prevent the development of PNET. Although a certain trend was observed in all the mentioned parameters, there was a relationship between, the presence of pineal cysts and bilateral disease (Pearson Chi X2: P=.191), a known family history (Fisher test; P=.114) and age of early diagnosis (Fisher test; P=.114). There were no significant differences in the mutation type identified. CONCLUSIONS Considering pineal cysts as a pre-malignant form of pinealoblastoma, we found a relationship between the germinal line mutation of the RB1 gene and the cases with bilateral or unilateral retinoblastoma.</dc:description>
