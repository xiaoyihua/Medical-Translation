<dc:description xml:lang="en">The outcome of treatment for a first relapse in early stages (IA and IIA) of Hodgkin's disease after primary radiotherapy was analyzed in 86 patients. They received total nodal radiotherapy (TNR) as the primary treatment. Survival was used as the major endpoint. Median follow-up was 13.1 years. Duration of first complete remission was 60% for patients in stage IA and 39% for patients in stage IIA (p &lt; .01). At 10-years, the survival for patients in stage IA was 78% and only 55% for patients in stage IIA (p &lt; .01). A risk factor analysis showed that the presence of stage IIA and bulky disease (adenopathy &gt; 7 cm) were associated with a worse prognosis. We believe that the use of TNR as initial treatment in early stages of Hodgkin's disease should be considered in patients in stage IA and without bulky disease. Patients in stage IIA and risk factors, such as bulky disease, should be treated with more aggressive therapeutic regimens.</dc:description>
