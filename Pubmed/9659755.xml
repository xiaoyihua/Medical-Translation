<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The congruence of interests between health care providers and clients is essential if subjects with chronic diseases will be educated. AIM To assess, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, those fields in which they would like to receive education. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eighty eight patients with rheumatoid arthritis were surveyed about the topics in which they would like to be educated. The inquiry included medical aspects, handicap overcoming, social issues and labor aspects. RESULTS Eighty two percent of patients were interested in medical aspects, 77% in social issues and 71% in handicap overcoming. Eighty three percent of patients with greater handicaps preferred handicap overcoming, 75% social aspects and 74% medical aspects. Younger patients had a greater interest in labor aspects, those with a recently diagnosed disease were interested in their legal rights and those with a prolonged disease wanted information about self help groups. CONCLUSIONS The greater educational interests of patients with rheumatoid arthritis were on medical aspects. However, those impaired by the disease were interested in handicap overcoming. Age and duration of the disease also influenced the educational interests of patients. Thus, education in these patients must be individualized.</dc:description>
