<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To present our experience with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. METHODS We reviewed our series of 73 squamous cell carcinoma of the penis over the last 23 years. Patient mean age was 65.7 years. All lesions had been previously biopsied. Patient records were reviewed for a history of phimosis and related lesions. The histological, clinical and therapeutic aspects, and survival are analyzed. RESULTS Most of the squamous cell carcinoma of the penis were superficial lesions (pT1). Treatment was by partial penile resection in 42 cases, total penile resection in 9, and emasculation in 2 cases. Conservative surgery was performed in 20 cases (tumor excision in 14 and posthectomy in 6 cases). Lymphadenectomy was performed in 11 patients. Eight patients received radiotherapy to the inguinal region. The rate of recurrence after surgery was 11% (8 cases). Five of the 8 patients with tumor recurrence had been treated by conservative surgery. The 5-year survival rate was 78%. CONCLUSIONS Penile cancer is uncommon and accounts for less than 1% of tumors in the male in our setting. A higher incidence has been found in men with phimosis, poor hygiene and low sociocultural level. Partial penile resection is the treatment of choice for the primary lesion. The outcome is worse in patients with invasive tumor, poor cell differentiation, ulceroendophytic morphology, and above all in patients with metastatic adenopathy. Radiotherapy provided no benefits, made inguinal evaluation difficult and increased the morbidity in some cases. Patients with pT1 tumor and good cell differentiation showed no metastatic adenopathy during follow-up. Patient follow-up is fundamental to detect recurrence or metastatic adenopathy and to institute treatment immediately.</dc:description>
