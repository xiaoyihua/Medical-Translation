<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate attitudes and opinions of Spanish surgeons on the use of nasogastric tubes (NGT) and drainages after colorectal surgery. MATERIAL AND METHOD E-mail survey to the members of the Spanish Association of Coloproctology, and Coloproctology Division of the Spanish Surgical Association comparing the results with a previous survey from 1996. RESULTS Of the 413 surveys sent out, 131 (31.7%) were returned, this compared with 190 from 1996. NGT is routinely used by 22%, selectively by 35% and never by 43%, vs 62%, 31% and 7% in 1996 (p &lt; 0.001). Experience and accreditation in colorectal surgery was associated with its lower use. NGT is removed by 16% 24 hours after surgery, 9% later and 51% when peristalsis begins vs. 6%, 21% and 66% in 1996 (p &lt; 0.001). Of the total, 76% believe that the ileus is not reduced by NGT and 89% that it does not increase comfort vs 27% and 48% (p &lt; 0.001). Drainages are routinely used by 38.5% and selectively by a 57.7%, more than in 1996 (25% and 63%) (p &lt; 0.05). Board-Certification in colorectal surgery was associated with a lower use of drains (p &lt; 0.0001). Drains are not used by 46% in right colon surgery; 22% in left colon and 3.1% in rectal surgery. A total of 66% believe that its used reduce fluid collections and 43% that they drain anastomosis leaks without any differences from previous survey. Drains are considered very useful by 16% in colon surgery and by 52% in rectal surgery. CONCLUSIONS There is a tendency to decrease the use of NGT. However, drainages continue to be widely employed.</dc:description>
