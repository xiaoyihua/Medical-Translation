<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Our goal was to establish the different therapeutic regimens used in our clinical setting, and to determine the prevalence of genotypic resistances in patients under antiretroviral therapy, analyzing the relationship between the appearance of mutations and treatments along with other HIV related variables. MATERIAL AND METHOD 191 samples from the same number of patients who were on antiretroviral therapy and virological failure were analyzed. Samples were processed by means of the genotypic technique LiPA in order to study the presence of mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) and the protease (P) genes. Prescribed therapeutic regimens and epidemiological variables relevant in HIV infection were also analyzed. RESULTS Overall resistance prevalence was 72.32%. By LiPA, RT mutations were detected in 71.43% of patients, being M184V, T215Y and L41M the most frequent ones. Moreover, P mutations were detected in 59.38% of cases, being V82A, L90M and I84V the most frequent ones. 61.02% of the patients presented one or more mutations against the reverse transcriptase inhibitors included in their treatment. With regard to protease inhibitors, this fact was documented in 28.81% of cases, and in 23.73% of patients receiving both reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS Although the analysis of the mutation patterns by LiPA has known limitations, the prevalence of resistances in our study was different from that reported by other authors, being lower in the P gene and higher in the RT one. Of note, a high proportion of patients showed mutations against the drugs included in their prescribed treatment.</dc:description>
