<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Evaluation of rotatory activity induced by dopaminergic agonists is the most widely used test of conduct for the measurement of dopaminergic depletion of a unilateral lesion of the striatonigral pathway caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in rats, since it is quantitatively related to the extension of the dopaminergic denervation. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate, from different angles, the changes in conduct seen in the model of unilateral lesion with 6-OHDA and to establish correlation with the rotation induced by D-amphetamine and by apomorphine and the ladder test. MATERIAL AND METHODS Male Wistar rats were used. Lesions were produced in the SNpc by stereotactic injection of 6-OHDA into the right hemisphere and the effectiveness of the lesions was studied using the rotary conduct induced by D-amphetamine and apomorphine. The motor ability of the front legs was measured by the ladder test, carried out under standard and forced conditions. RESULTS All the animals with lesions had difficulty in reaching food with both legs, although the most pronounced deficit was in the leg contralateral to the lesion. The ladder test correlated better with rotatory activity induced by apomorphine than by D-amphetamine. CONCLUSION The animals with most dopamine loss showed most deficient use of their front legs.</dc:description>
