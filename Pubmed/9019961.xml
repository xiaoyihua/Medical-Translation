<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to present cases of infectious mononucleosis syndromes (i.m.) with dual rises in antibodies towards Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective study of 49 children that fulfilled Sumaya's clinical criteria was carried out. RESULTS Fifteen cases of i.m. were serologically positive for EBV, 12 for CMV, 2 for toxoplasma and 10 were serologically negative. The other ten had dual antibody rises to EBV and CMV. The symptoms were similar in the different groups. Significant differences were found only for the age at the time of presentation where below 4 years of age i.m. is rarely due to EBV (p &lt; 0.01). Analytically, only elevated serum transaminase concentrations suggested the etiology of EBV (p &lt; 0.05). Although i.m. with dual antibody rises towards EBV and CMV are more similar to cases due to EBV, they present characteristics from both viruses. CONCLUSIONS 1. There are i.m. with dual antibody rises to EBV and CMV 2. The meaning still remains unknown, but there are two hypotheses: coinfection or "endogenous reinfection". 3. Cases of EBV-i.m. and CMV-i.m. are clinically similar, except at the age of presentation and the rising of serum transaminase concentrations.</dc:description>
