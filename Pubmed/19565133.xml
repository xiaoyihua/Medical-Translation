<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Polymorphisms in genes involved in the atherosclerosis development, angiogenesis, and homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism could be risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of the VEGF C-2578A and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms on CAD, and the association of these polymorphisms with the severity and extension of atherosclerotic lesions and Hcy concentrations. METHODS Two hundred and forty-four subjects were evaluated by coronary angiography and included in the study (145 with CAD and 99 controls). The VEGF C-2578A and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms were investigated by the PCR-SSCP and PCR-RFLP techniques, respectively. Plasma Hcy was quantified by liquid chromatography/sequential mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS There was no significant difference in allele and genotype distribution between the groups, for both polymorphisms. The univariate analysis showed a higher frequency of the VEGF -2578AA genotype in the group with three-vessel disease (p=0.044). In addition, the VEGF -2578CA genotype was observed more frequently among individuals with &lt;95% stenosis (p=0.010). After adjustment for other risk factors for CAD in a multivariate model, the VEGF C-2578A polymorphism was not found to be an independent correlate of CAD (p=0.688). The MTHFR polymorphism did not show any association with the extension and/or severity of the CAD. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism showed no direct association with hyperhomocysteinemia or increased mean plasma concentrations of Hcy. CONCLUSION Although there is an apparent association between VEGF C-2578A and the development of coronary atherosclerosis, this association is not independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors.</dc:description>
