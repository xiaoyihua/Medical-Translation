<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION There is still insufficient scientific evidence on which is the best technique to perform the anastomosis -intracorporeal (IC) or extracorporeal (EC)- in right laparoscopic hemicolectomy. The objective of the present study is to determine whether there are differences to compare in both techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS A study was performed on a prospective patient series subjected to right laparoscopic hemicolectomy in our Hospital. The preoperative and the postoperative variables associated with complications recorded depending on the type of anastomosis. RESULTS A total of 60 patients were intervened form June 2004 to June 2010 (35 IC; 25 EC). There were no significant differences between both groups as regards baseline preoperative characteristics or associated comorbidities. The median operation time was 212 minutes (142-305 min), with no significant difference between both techniques. The number of lymph nodes removed was higher in the IC group (21 versus 14; p=0.03). The beginning of oral tolerance and the first bowel movement were significantly earlier in the IC group. The complications rate was similar for both groups (14% IC; 16% EC; p=0.89). Three patients in the IC group had anastomosis dehiscence. The mortality rate was 2.8% (one patient in each group). CONCLUSION Intracorporeal versus extracorporeal anastomosis in right laparoscopic hemicolectomy can obtain a higher number of resected lymph nodes and an earlier oral tolerance and intestinal transit.</dc:description>
