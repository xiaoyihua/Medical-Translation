<dc:description xml:lang="es">Introduction. Intrathecal analgesia has emerged as a therapeutic option for pain relief in patients with chronic pain in those where other forms of treatment have failed. The objective was to evaluate disability and the quality of life in patients with chronic intractable pain. Material and methods. Retrospective, longitudinal and descriptive study, including 27 patients of both sexes, aged 18&#150;85 years, in whom an intrathecal infusion pump was implanted for at least 6 months. Pain intensity was measured using the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Oswestry disability index (ODI) and quality of life prior to the Fast-Espiditest implant and at six months. Results. A total of 65.38% had mixed pain, with post-laminectomy syndrome being the more frequent aetiological diagnosis (51.8%). The initial VAS score was 7.7±1 and at six-months it was 2.07±1, which was statistically significant (P=0.00001). The initial ODI was 61.2&amp;%#x000B1;10.8 (Disabled) and the final ODW was 20.2&amp;%#x000B1;8.7 (minimal disability), with a statistical significance of P=0.000006. The initial Fast-Espiditest showed intense pain in 4 patients, (14%), moderate in 21 patients (77%), and mild in 2 patients (7.4%), and the final Fast-Espiditest, intense pain in 1 patient (3.7%), moderate in 4 patients (14.8%), and mild in 22 patients (81.4%). Conclusions. The intrathecal infusion pump is a safe and effective device, which obtains an adequate alleviation of the pain in the patients with chronic intractable pain, improving their functionality and therefore their quality of life (AU)</dc:description>
