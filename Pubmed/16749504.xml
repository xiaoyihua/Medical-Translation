<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Evaluate long-term evolution of patients submitted to surgery for coarctation of the aorta. Compare event free survival in younger vs older patients at the time of surgical correction. METHODS We reviewed the clinical records of patients operated for coarctation of the aorta from January 1 1980 to December 31 1994. The mean follow-up ranged from 9 to 23 years (mean 10.9 y). Final events registered were recoarctation, death, systemic hypertension, endocarditis, stroke, aneurisms. RESULTS Two hundred and sixteen patients were found with mean age 13 +/- 12 y male gender was most frequent (61%). Recoarctation was found in 13 patients (6.02%), persistent hypertension in 14.1%. Event free survival at 10 years was 86.2%. In patients less than 10 y was 89% vs 80.2% in older patients. Hypertension free survival in patients less than 10 y was 98.3% vs 80.1% in older patients (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our data confirms that surgical treatment for coarctation of the aorta is associated with low morbidity and mortality at long-term with reduced rate of recoarctation (7%). Early correction (&lt; 10 y) is associated with a better long term survival. Hypertension and use of pharmacologic treatment are reduced after surgery and persist in the long-term evolution.</dc:description>
