<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES 1. To study the epidemiological characteristics and types of epileptic seizures in infancy. 2. To evaluate our experience with the ILAE classification of epilepsies and epileptic syndromes and to study the relative frequency of the different epileptic syndromes. PATIENTS AND METHODS All patients under 14 years of age that were evaluated for one or more unprovoked seizures in a primary care hospital between January 1, 1988 and June 1, 1994 were prospectively included in the study. In the 151 patients that met these criteria, we studied the epidemiological characteristics, predominantly the type of seizure and the classification as to type of epileptic syndrome. RESULTS 1. ETIOLOGY Of all of the seizures, 18% were considered symptomatic with a predominance in the first three years of life (34%), 28% were idiopathic with the predominance of cases occurring over three years of age (34%) and 54% cryptogenic, with an even distribution in all age groups. 2. Epileptic seizure type: Patients under 3 years old had 17% generalized epilepsies, 20% localization-related, 31% undetermined and 31% isolated seizures. In the 4-9 year olds, had 12%, 51%, 4%, and 32%, respectively. Between 4-14 years of age, benign rolandic epilepsy accounted for 17% of the epilepsies. Sixty-two percent of the patients remained classified in nonspecific categories (26% isolated seizures, 16% undetermined and 20% cryptogenic localization-related). CONCLUSIONS The study of unprovoked seizures in children shows marked differences in the different age groups in respect to epileptic seizure type, etiology and epileptic syndrome classification. The application of the ILAE classification system leaves the majority of patients in non-specific categories.</dc:description>
