<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of excessive daytime somnolence (EDS) in a sample of residents from Mexico City. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was done using a randomized telephone survey. A structured questionnaire (including demographic and clinical data) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale, a valid and reliable instrument for the detection of EDS, were administered. RESULTS A total sample of 200 subjects was obtained, with a mean age of 37 +/- 16.24 years. EDS was found in 31.5% of the subjects; 12.5% considered that EDS interfered in a significant way with daily activities, and 9% with work related abilities. Subjects with EDS were older, came from lower socio-economic status, and had a significantly higher body mass index. DISCUSSION Our results indicate that EDS is more frequent in Mexico City residents than in other populations. Notwithstanding, the association between EDS with advanced age, lower socio-economic status and high body mass index requires further investigation.</dc:description>
