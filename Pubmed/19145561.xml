<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Although the association between headaches and pineal gland cysts has been suggested on a number of occasions, no precise evidence of exactly what this relation involves has been produced to date. It is known, however, that a cyst in the pineal gland can bring on or worsen headaches, especially if it is large or there has been bleeding, due to obstructive compromise in the third ventricle and the resulting hydrocephalus that is produced. CASE REPORT A 15 years-old male who had suffered from migraine from the age of 6 years and who suddenly experienced a worsening of his headaches, both as regards their frequency and their intensity, over the previous days; no known precipitating factor appeared to be involved. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed the presence of a giant cyst in the pineal gland, with a notable amount of blood inside it, which was producing an obstructive hydrocephalus. The decision was made to resort to surgical treatment, with resection of the cyst and placement of a shunt valve. As a result the patient's headaches improved greatly and this improvement continued throughout a six-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Worsening of a headache, in this case migraine, for no apparent cause must make us consider secondary processes, although they may be as rare as the one described here.</dc:description>
