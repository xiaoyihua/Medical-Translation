<dc:description xml:lang="en">Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia is an inherited autosomal dominant disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1:2,500 to 1:5,000, being higher in males (3:1). It is characterised histologically by the substitution of cardiomyocytes for fibrous-adipose tissue, which predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias, right ventricular failure, and sudden cardiac death. The main aim of treatment is to reduce the risk of sudden death and improve the quality of life of patients. The case is presented of a 23 year old woman whose clinical symptoms started with palpitations, chest pain with physical activity, syncope, and headache, 6 years ago during her first pregnancy. Due to an increase in symptomatology, a stress test was performed, during which she collapsed with a sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. A cardiac magnetic resonance scan showed dilation, an increase in trabeculae, and decreased function of the right ventricle. A 3-dimensional mapping and ablation was performed, and during the isoproterenol infusion test, a polymorphic ventricular flutter was generated that required electrical cardioversion. The decision was made to implant a dual chamber cardioverter defibrillator and perform stellate ganglion ablation as secondary prevention. After her discharge, the patient re-consulted many times due to discharges of the device associated with palpitations. A comprehensive review of the patient's medical records was performed, finding characteristics that may suggest arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. The Task Force criteria was applied, concluding that, as she met more than 2 major criteria, the patient had a definitive diagnosis of this disease.</dc:description>
