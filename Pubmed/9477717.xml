<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Evaluation of the results of a microbiological analysis of food prepared in high-risk communal dining-rooms, in order to establish the degree of contamination, analyze the causes of this contamination, and improve the health standards of these establishments. METHODS Descriptive, observational study with data obtained from a health inspection on 44 high-risk communal dining-rooms, which included the microbiological analysis of 90 foods, as well as the health inspection of the establishments. RESULTS In schools mesophil micro-organisms were the most frequent contaminants; in kindergardens and homes for the elderly deficient hygiene standards were predominant in the handling of food. A greater proportion of mesophil micro-organisms were to be found during the cold months than in warmer months. Deficient hygiene indicators appeared generally in the case of food prepared in establishments in which deficiencies were observed. Psychrotrophes were not found in any of the food samples collected in kindergartens but were found in schools and homes for the elderly. CONCLUSIONS This study indicates which problems predominate in each type of high-risk communal dining-room. Mesophils appeared in food prepared in large-scale kitchens, deficient hygiene standards were found to be associated to handling of food by non-professional staff and substandard establishments, and psychrotrophes were detected in establishments which kept left-overs. Recommendations were made as to how to eliminate the problems detected.</dc:description>
