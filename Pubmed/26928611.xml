<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease. Its surgical indication is undisputed in symptomatic severe AS, however, 30% of patients are at high surgical risk or inoperable. Transcatheter Valve Implantation (TAVI) is an alternative for this group of patients. AIM To describe the clinical outcomes of TAVI in a group of patients treated at the Instituto Nacional del Tórax, Santiago, Chile. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospective study including all patients referred for TAVI due to their high surgical risk or being inoperable. All-cause mortality, secondary stroke, permanent pacemaker implantation, vascular complications, prosthetic and periprosthetic regurgitation, Karnosfky test and Functional Capacity (FC) were assessed as endpoints. RESULTS We evaluated 26 patients with a mean age of 82 years (74% women) in whom 27 procedures were done. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 8.8%. Overall mortality at 30 days, one and two years was 11.1, 18.5 and 29.6% respectively. Karnofsky score increased significantly from 62.3% at baseline to 83.9; 88.6 and 88.8% at six months, one and two years, respectively. Prior to the procedure, FC was 3.1 ± 0.6, decreasing significantly to 1.2; 1.3 and 1 at six months, one and two years of follow up. CONCLUSIONS TAVI is an effective alternative treatment for patients with severe symptomatic AS and high surgical risk.</dc:description>
