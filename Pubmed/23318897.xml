<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding influenza pandemic, with special emphasis on issues related to influenza vaccine, seasonal and pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cross-sectional study, probabilistic multistage sampling in patients over 18 years, residents of Mexico City (and metropolitan area), Monterrey, Guadalajara and Merida in December 2009. RESULTS A total of 1.600 subjects (48.9% male) were interviewed, 34% had previously received seasonal flu vaccine, 90.6% were willing to be vaccinated against A(H1N1), 46.5% of those who would not receive the vaccine was because they did not trust A (H1N1), 68% considered influenza A (H1N1) as a risk for their family. Hand washing was the preventive measure most commonly reported (47.5%), secondly influenza vaccine (28%). Schooling (1.7, p=0.006) and age (1.02, p&lt;0.001) influence rejection to get vaccine. 82.9% of respondents rate the federal government's management as good or very good. CONCLUSIONS There was a high acceptance rate for the pandemic influenza vaccine in Mexico when compared to similar studies in other countries, the main reason for those who reject the vaccine was distrust in it.</dc:description>
