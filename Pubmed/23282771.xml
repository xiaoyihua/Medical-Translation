<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have a better survival in chronic dialysis than patients with other etiologies of renal failure. It has been suggested that extra-renal manifestations of ADPKD may increase the odds of complications and mortality, if these patients are transplanted. AIM To determine whether survival and complications in transplanted patients with ADPKD are different from kidney graft recipients with other etiologies of renal failure. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Four hundred six patients with kidney transplantation were followed in three hospitals between 1976 and 2011 and 19 were carriers of ADPKD. The latter were matched by type of donor, gender, age and date of kidney transplant, with 38 graft recipients with other etiologies of renal failure. RESULTS Graft and patient 1, 5, 10 and 15 years survival were similar in both groups. Hospitalizations due to viral infections and sepsis were more common in patients with ADPKD. There were no differences in the rate of acute rejection, delayed graft function, cancer, gastrointestinal disorders and hospitalizations due to cardiovascular diseases. The frequency of graft loss due to death with a functioning kidney was similar between both groups. CONCLUSIONS Patient and graft survival in transplanted patients with ADPKD were similar to patients with other etiologies of renal failure. The rate and type of complications were similar between groups with the exception of hospitalizations due to sepsis and viral infections, which were more common in ADPKD patients.</dc:description>
