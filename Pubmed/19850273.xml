<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Temporomandibular disorders are associated with symptoms such as tinnitus, vertigo, sensation of hearing loss, ear fullness and otalgia. The connection and dysfunction of the tensor tympani and tensor veli palatini muscles seems to be associated with the aforementioned symptoms. We seek to demonstrate and explain this connection through the morphometry of these structures. METHODS We studied 22 paired blocks and 1 left side of human temporal bone. Digital measurements were made of the tensor tympani muscles and stapes. RESULTS The average length of the stapedial muscle was 5.8 mm SD 0.61, and that of the tensor tympani was 19.69 mm SD 1.07. Anatomical connections were found in all the samples between the tensor veli palatini muscles through a common tendon. CONCLUSIONS There is a need for an interdisciplinary management between physician and specialized dentist in cases of craniofacial pain.</dc:description>
