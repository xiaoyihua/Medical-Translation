<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Very few texts in the literature approach the neurologic exam of patients with neuropathic pain (NP). The objective of this study was to evaluate the profile of patients with NP through the neurological exam. METHODS This is an observational study that followed-up patients with NP for one year. The neurologic exam was evaluated at the outpatient clinic and through prospective analysis. Patients whose pain severity was equal or greater than six on the Visual Analogue Scale were included in this study. RESULTS Burning pain predominated, affecting 54.5% of the patients. Unlike multifocal neuropathy (15.15%), distal and symmetrical polyneuropathy was the predominant clinical-topographic pattern (48%). The thermoalgic and tactile modalities of the sensorial exam were affected the most, followed by changes in motor function and deep tendon reflexes, and proprioception. Although NP does not have specific signs and symptoms, burning pain is attributed to the involvement of thin nerve fibers and thermoalgic pain is typical of those changes. CONCLUSIONS History and physical exam findings are key factors in the diagnosis of NP. The log of changes in the physical exam should emphasize the involvement observed, guiding the diagnostic and therapeutic approach, curative or palliative.</dc:description>
