<dc:description xml:lang="en">Molecular investigation into the physiopathology of interstitial lung diseases has gained special interest through the trials carried out in the last decade. These trials seem to point at the role played by certain molecules, such as cytokines (transforming growth factor, platelet derived growth factor) and integrins, in the processes that lead to pulmonary fibrosis during the course of interstitial lung disease. They also demonstrate the important role that angiotensin II plays in increasing the secretion of transforming growth factor by several cells. The above-mentioned studies allow new therapeutic approaches to be considered which will possibly improve the serious prognosis of such diseases once they have reached the last stage of their course: pulmonary fibrosis.</dc:description>
