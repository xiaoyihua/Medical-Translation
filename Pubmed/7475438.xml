<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The care of the neurologic patients should be approached from the first level of health care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of knowledge concerning neurology that have the general public health care physicians in Catalonia, Spain, and to determine whether the training in family and community medicine (FCM) is valid for the adequate care of neurologic patients. METHODS A sample of 84 general physicians (GP) from the public health care (PHC), representative of the professionals attending the medical consultations of the Costa de Ponent Catalonian Public Health Care Region (one million inhabitants), was evaluated by a multiple choice test of 36 items which has been previously elaborated and shown to have sufficient psychometric guarantees (objectivity, reliability and validity). RESULTS The GP from the PHC who had not undergone the Resident Training in FCM demonstrated, as a whole, to have an insufficient level of preparation in neurology (mean = 4.08, DT = 2.5, 69% obtained a score under 5 in a scale from 0 to 10). The physician that have received resident training in FCM showed to be a very relevant factor in the knowledge of clinical neurology (mean = 7.84, DT = 1.1, all scored above 5). CONCLUSIONS The level of the knowledge of neurology in general public health physicians should be improved, particularly in those who have not received the resident training in family and community medicine. Such a training was found to be useful for acquiring correct preparation in neurology.</dc:description>
