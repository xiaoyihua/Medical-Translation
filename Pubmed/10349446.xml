<dc:description xml:lang="en">24 patients with fascioliasis were studied. 19 of them were in the chronic stage and 5 in acute stage. The presence of antigens and of circulating immune complexes (CIC) was detected in 100% of the patients suffering from acute fascioliasis with less than 30 days of evolution of the clinical symptoms; whereas coproantigens were present in 100% of the chronic patients. In this group it was observed a considerable number of cases with elevated levels of antibodies. 43.7% of the cases with CIC were detected by using the precipitation technique with PEG and that of Clq deviation. A highly significant correlation was found between the eggs counting and the CIC levels by both techniques. Another important correlation was established between the eggs counting and the levels of coproantigens.</dc:description>
