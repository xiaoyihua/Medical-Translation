<dc:description xml:lang="en">The effect of ethanol (4 g/kg) as well as the role of serotoninergic neurons on the rate of ovulation and plasma LH, FSH and prolactin secretion have been studied in rats at preovulatory periods (18th hour of diestrus). It has been found that administration of ethanol in preovulatory periods decreased the number of ovules per rat (p less than 0.001), the number of ovulating rats and LH levels (p less than 0.001). These effects were accompanied by an increase in prolactin concentration (0.05 greater than p greater than 0.02), which was followed by a diffuse luteinization in the ovarian tissue. These results showed that ethanol had an effect of central depression in preovulatory periods. These effects could be mediated through the hypothalamic releasing factors. Under previous serotonin depletion with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA: 300 mg/kg), ethanol caused similar effects on LH and FSH levels as compared with the control group with PCPA. However, prolactin concentration was not increased. These results showed that serotoninergic neurons could be mediated in changes caused by ethanol on prolactin secretion, but do not affect directly in changes caused on LH and FSH secretion.</dc:description>
