<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Voiding dysfunction and urinary retention were frequent complications of sling. More recently synthetic supplies such as polypropylene mesh have been included in the armamentarium for sub urethral support. METHODS A prospective non randomized study was conducted. Sling procedure was performed in 436 consecutive patients with SUI. Patients were divided in groups according to mesh type, being 210 on autologous and 226 on synthetic. Patients were surveyed on voiding condition, continence and satisfaction. Surgical results were assessed according to Blaivas classification. Results were considered significant p&lt;0.05. RESULTS Mean patient age was 48.4 years. Mean operative time for autologous sling was of 107.6 min versus 20.6 min for synthetic. Mean hospitalization was 36h on autologous versus 24h on synthetic and mean follow up was 25 months. We found 87.1% and 92.9% of patients continent in autologous and synthetic group, respectively. Failure was presented by 7% in autologous and 4.8% in synthetic group (p=0.1961). The global rate of BOO was of 4.5% (20/436), when analysed by groups we found on autologous a rate of 8.5% (18/210), compared to 0.9% on synthetics (2/226) (p=0.000126). CONCLUSIONS Autologous and synthetic slings presented comparable success rates, however BOO was more common among patients treated by autologous slings.</dc:description>
