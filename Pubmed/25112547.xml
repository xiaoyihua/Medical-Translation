<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of insomnia in inpatient in an Internal Medicine Department and to identify risk factors of sleep disorders. METHOD A cross-sectional observational study was designed. Inpatients over eighteen years old hospitalized for acute medical conditions were recruited. Insomnia was assessed by the Athens insomnia scale. A nurse administered a questionnaire on risk factors including socio-demographic factors, reason for admission, comorbidities, current medications, functional status, nocturnal symptoms, and environmental factors. RESULTS A total of 299 patients were recruited with a mean age of 73.7 years (SD 14.2). Overall prevalence of insomnia was 42.1%, slightly higher in women (48.2%) than in men (37.0%) (P=.052). In those less than 65 years the prevalence was 33.8%, and in patients aged 65 or over it was 44.9% (P=.093). The main factors associated with insomnia were a history of anxiety, depression and stroke, heartburn, pain, fear, and poor functional capacity at admission. Environmental factors such as noise, the sensation of cold or heat, and changing habits involved in hospitalization did not reach statistical significance. In patients 65 years or older, the use of beta-blockers was associated with insomnia. The multivariate analysis showed stroke, heartburn, and pain as independent risk factors for insomnia. CONCLUSIONS Insomnia is highly prevalent among inpatient, and is associated with some treatable or modifiable factors.</dc:description>
