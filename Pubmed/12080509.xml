<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In recent years new anti Parkinson drugs have been marketed and there has been controversy over the safety of some drugs. OBJECTIVE To analyze the evolution of the consumption of anti Parkinson drugs and the effect of the newer drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS A study of the consumption of anti Parkinson drugs (1989 1998). Data were obtained from the ECOM database of the Ministry of Health and TEMPUS of the National Statistics Institute. The drugs were classified using the Anatomo Therapeutic Clinical Classification (ATC). Consumption was expressed in defined daily dosage (DDD) and the costs in euros. The drugs marketed since 1990 were classified as new drugs and the others as classical drugs. RESULTS The total consumption of drugs increased from 1.92 DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day in 1989 to 3.64 DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day in 1998. The drugs showing the greatest increase were selegiline, pergolide and levodopa. The total pharmaceutical expenses tripled. There was a smaller increase in the consumption of new drugs (1.2% of the total in 1991 and 6.6% in 1998) than in their costs (6.7% of the total in 1991 and 38.8% in 1998). The cost per DDD of the new drugs increased five times (1989: 2.55 euros and 1998: 13.59 euros) and that of the classical drugs was similar (1989: 0.54 euros and 1998: 0.62 euros). CONCLUSIONS The total consumption of anti Parkinson drugs has progressively increased. The consumption of selegiline has also increased in spite of controversy over its safety. The new drugs have a major economic effect.</dc:description>
