<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors take up the subject with a retrospective review of the concepts of economic and social development, the health policy that has emerged in the last 25 years, and the salient characteristics of health practice and the training of nursing personnel. They interpret development in the health field and various approaches to the extension of the health services coverage that have been taken in the countries of Latin America through implementation of the strategies of primary care and community participation. Finally, they present several considerations on the future of nursing, with emphasis on a comprehensive view of the profession as an occupation and a social practice, after which they formulate a series of propositions that can serve as a basis for training of the nursing personnel that will be needed to serve society adequately.</dc:description>
