<dc:description xml:lang="en">The meeting was held in the city of Morelia in October of 1996. The objective of the meeting was to establish the diagnostic criteria, prognosis and the general basis of treatment for Mexican children with ALL. The participants were 43 hematologists or hemo-oncologists from institutions involved in the primary care of children with ALL in the major cities of Mexico. Seven topics were discussed: laboratory workup, risk factors, treatment of standard risk ALL, treatment of high risk non-T ALL, treatment of T-ALL and the leukemia-lymphoma syndrome, treatment of extramedullary ALL, and treatment of relapsing ALL. The proposals and conclusions are presented in this document for distribution to physicians interested in pediatric ALL.</dc:description>
