<dc:description xml:lang="en">We would like to describe the characteristics of affection by carcinoid tumor in our surroundings. In so doing, we have reviewed the clinical histories of the 131 cases of carcinoid tumor diagnosed in our center between 1972 and 1990. The incidence has been 0.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year. The age at diagnosis is from 8 to 88 years, and the proportion of men to women is practically 1. The most common locale affected the appendix (54 cases) followed by the bronchials (46 cases). The most common clinical presentation has been casual discovery and in the bronchials, in addition to hemoptysis and pneumonia. Carcinoid syndrome was found in only 4 cases, and of 17 determinations of indole acetic 5-hydoxi acid, only 2 resulted pathological. There were four cases of hepatic metastasis and two deaths related with the tumor.</dc:description>
