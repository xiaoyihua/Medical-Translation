<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To investigate whether doctors know users' beliefs about health and to investigate some of these beliefs. DESIGN A crossover study. SETTING The Cartuja and Almanjayar Health Centres in Granada. PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS These were 204 users of the two centres, chosen at random and who attended for on-demand attention for whatever reason. Eleven patients refused the questionnaire. INTERVENTIONS A 23-question questionnaire was administered during november and december 1993. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS 64% were women and 36% men. Distribution by age and gender in both centres was similar. Coincidence (defined as 50% of replies totally in agreement and/or in agreement with the item in the questionnaire) between users' beliefs and doctors' opinions of those beliefs was slight (30%). Doctors' opinions concerning their patients' beliefs coincided with the beliefs shown by people with a lower educational level (F = 11.21, p &lt; 0.00001) and over 45 years old (Sp = 0.25, p &lt; 0.001). 70% thought that "illnesses are seen better on the screen"; and 57% that "if analysis and x-rays are not done, they don't feel satisfied". CONCLUSIONS Doctors do not know their patients' health beliefs, attributing to the whole population the health beliefs of those who most consult the doctor. Users place great hopes in technology, with no relation to age, gender or educational level.</dc:description>
