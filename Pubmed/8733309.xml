<dc:description xml:lang="en">We studied the evolution of HIV-1 infection and immune response during six years in two twins born from an infected mother. The children had a continuous progression of the infection, proved by CD4+ cell count, serum anti-HIV antibodies, cultivable virus and proviral load. Now, both children are on antiviral treatment. The analysis of serum antibodies showed a different immune response in both children. One of them developed higher levels of antibodies directed against viral proteins and synthetic peptides derived from their aminoacid sequence. In this child, the amount of cultivable virus increased less than in his twin. Nucleotide sequencing of a part of viral genoma, showed that the virus belonged to the B subtype, prevalent in America and Europe. The observed differences in viral sequences suggest a different selective pressure in both twins. This phenomenon could be related to the observed differences in immune response.</dc:description>
