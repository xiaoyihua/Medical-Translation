<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to establish whether there was a histoplasmosis outbreak among a group of residents of Naucalpan (State of Mexico, a non-endemic area for histoplasmosis) and to ascertain the source through which they were infected. MATERIAL AND METHODS Anyone associated with the Index Case in the same period with a flu-like infection was considered as a suspected case. Diagnosis was confirmed by clinical examination positive, cultures and positive immunological tests. Date and form of potential exposure were obtained through interviews. Material potentially contaminated with bird or bat droppings was sought and analyzed by PCR. RESULTS The outbreak was associated with a trip to El Tamarindo (Veracruz, near the Gulf of Mexico). Patients got sick after digging a hole in the floor inside a house where a treasure had been supposedly buried by a death relative. The pathogen was detected in soil samples at 10 cm below the surface. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that patients contracted histoplasmosis in El Tamarindo, a community where there had been no prior cases of this disease.</dc:description>
