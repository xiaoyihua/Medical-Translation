<dc:description xml:lang="en">Chronic radiodermatitis after radiotherapy is a frequent sequela that may be worrying for the patient. Few cases have been published in the literature in which pulsed-dye laser has been used in the treatment of telangiectasias that appeared after radiotherapy for breast cancer. We present a female patient with radiodermatitis on the neck after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The patient received five sessions of pulsed-dye laser treatment (3 ms pulse duration, 7 mm spot size, fluence between 7 and 12 J/cm 2). Sequential histological studies were performed. The response to treatment was very good, with the lesions almost completely disappearing. The patient was very satisfied with the result. Pulsed-dye laser is a safe and effective treatment for chronic radiodermatitis of the neck after radiotherapy.</dc:description>
