<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Sevelamer is a non-absorbable phosphorus chelator that is not a source of aluminium, calcium or base. The clinical experience with sevelamer in peritoneal dialysis and in daily clinical practice is scarce. The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of therapy of hyperphosphoremia with sevelamer on serum phosphorus and phosphorus chelators requirements, in a peritoneal dialysis clinical practice. METHODS Sevalamer 400 mg was prescribed to peritoneal dialysis patients with hyperphosphoremia who were treated with aluminium hydroxide or with calcium salts in the absence of hypocalcemia. Fourteen patients completed 12 months of therapy. RESULTS The initial sevelamer dose was 2,280 +/- 760 mg/day, and was increased to 2,760 +/- 1,160 mg/day at 12 months. At 12 months no patient was on aluminium salts and calcium salts had been significantly reduced. Phosphoremia (5.9 +/- 0.6 to 5.0 +/- 1.4 mg/dL, p = 0.049), calcium-phosphorus product (59.8 +/- 5.8 to 48.6 +/- 12.5 mg2/dL2, p = 0.01) and serum cholesterol (191 +/- 29 to 167 +/- 33 mg/dL, p = 0.02) decreased at 12 months. No significant changes were observed in serum triglycerides, total CO2 or PTH. Serum alkaline phosphatase increased at 6 months, but values returned to normal at 12 months. No changes were observed in serum gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase. Five patients were started on 1.25 (OH)2 vitamin D therapy. CONCLUSION In peritoneal dialysis patients, sevelamer allows a satisfactory control of serum phosphorus levels and calcium-phosphorus product, while decreasing the amount of aluminium and calcium salts prescribed.</dc:description>
