<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To know the utilization of the screening mammography among women from 25 to 65 years old in an urban health zone, where there is not an specific screening program for breast cancer. To detect the demographic and risk determinants that are involved in the mammography screening use. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A sample of 1,240 women were interviewed consecutively as they visited their physician. Risk factors, sociodemographic variables and use of health services were analyzed. The associated variables with the use of mammography screening were determined by univariant analysis. A multiple logistic regression model was designed to identify the variables independently associated with the use of mammography screening. RESULTS The percentage of interviewed women who have completed at least one mammography screening in the last three years has been 10.2 +/- 3% (confidence level: 95%), 68.3% of them were under 50 years old. The variables independently associated with the use of mammography screening were: age (OR = 1.08); routine visit to the gynecologist (OR = 8.13); educational level (primary: OR = 2.44, secondary: OR = 3.66, university: OR = 7.43, no schooling: reference level); and knowledge about the benefits of mammography screening (OR = 6.15). Family history of breast cancer and the other risk factors were found not to be associated with the use of mammography screening. CONCLUSIONS The use of mammography screening among women from 25 to 65 years is inadequate according to the age and other risk factors. Mammography screening among women with a family history of breast cancer and those over 50 years old is underused, so it would be recommended and their use increased for these women. But women under 40 years old without family history of breast cancer have to be dissuaded from undertaking such a screening.</dc:description>
