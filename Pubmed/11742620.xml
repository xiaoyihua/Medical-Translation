<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Developing recommendations about consultation times in neurology helps plan the endowment of human resources and can contribute to homogenize and improve quality of health-care. OBJECTIVES To elaborate recommendations on the consultation times needed to obtain enough quality neurology visits. MATERIAL AND METHOD We used consensus search techniques, in particular the Community Impression technique. An ad hoc committee developed a preliminary proposal which was later discussed during a unlimited attendance working meeting and eventually voted by members of the Spanish Society of Neurology. The committee drew up a final consensus report after analysing the debate results and counting the ballots. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: "It is necessary that the Spanish Society of Neurology establishes and recommends standardized consultation times for neurology outpatients visits in Spain. These standardized values refer to consultation time per patient, both in the first and follow-up visits, in a General Neurology Outpatients Clinic. Moreover, there must be considered 'recommendable times' on one hand, and 'minimal required times' on the other hand. Any time value below the minimal required time means that the consultation duration does not fulfill the minimal requirements needed to warrant a care with acceptable quality for the patient". These recommendations are: Time for first consultation. Recommendable time: 45 minutes (Minimal required time: 25 minutes). Time for follow-up consultation. Recommendable time: 20 minutes (Minimal required time: 15 minutes).</dc:description>
