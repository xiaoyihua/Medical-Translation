<dc:description xml:lang="en">We have studied 17 cases of pseudomycotic onychoses. This condition is frequently seen in the toe nails with the clinical aspect of hyperkeratosis of the nail bed and onycholysis. The Giemsa stained preparations have been performed with the clinical material previously heated in a 40% OHK solution and washed out with distilled water by centrifugation. The microorganism has similar or identical characteristics to those of the agent of erythrasma of the folds. Its morphology and physiological characteristics are comcon to "Corynebacterium" and "Nocardia". It is a gram positive, acid-fast organism with tendency to produce filaments with short lateral branches and fragmentation spores. Indirect inmunofluorescence identifies microorganisms present in the clinical material and that obtained in cultures.</dc:description>
