<dc:description xml:lang="en">Recent studies on the etiology and prevention of dental caries are synthetized. Caries is an infectious disease produced by the bacterial plaque where microorganisms act upon hydrocarbon substrate producing acids (lactic, pyruvic, acetic, etc.). These acids decalcify the enamel surface producing the carious cavity. The three types of caries are mentioned: 1. The sucrose-dependent caries on the free surfaces of the tooth with the Streptococcus mutans predominance. 2. The pits and fissures caries with Lactobacillus acidophilus predominance. 3. The root caries with Acinomyces viscosus predominance. Caries prevention points out to three aspects. 1. Increasing tooth resistance through the use of ingested fluoride and/or topical fluorides and pits and fissure sealants. 2. A profuse and promising research work on control of microbial plaque is being done. Meanwhile, the correct and periodically controlled toothbrushing is still the most efficient preventive measure. 3. Diet control. Being carbohydrates a deep rooted habit of our modern culture, its control has to be carefully evaluated. A judicious and reduced strategic consumption of carbohydrates and the use of substitutes are useful ways of achieving the preventive aims.</dc:description>
