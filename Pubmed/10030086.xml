<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND As sanitary conditions of a population improve, hepatitis A virus infection occurs at higher ages, thus decreasing the prevalence of antibodies against the virus. In the eighties, the prevalence of antibodies among children was 97% and depended on the socioeconomic level. AIM To assess the prevalence of antibodies against hepatitis A virus in school age children living in Valdivia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Two thousand three hundred thirty three school age children were studied. Total antibodies against hepatitis A virus were detected using an ELISA kit from Abbott. Children were stratified in age groups and school were classified as private, subsidized, municipal or foster homes. RESULTS Antibodies were positive in 65% of children (59% in children aged 6 to 8 years old, 66% in children aged 9 to 11 years and 69% in children aged 12 to 15 years. In private schools, the prevalence was 26%, in subsidized schools the figure was 54%, in municipal schools 73% and in foster homes 91%. CONCLUSIONS The general prevalence of antibodies against hepatitis A virus is higher in low socioeconomic level children. There is a global decrease in the prevalence of these antibodies in the last years.</dc:description>
