<dc:description xml:lang="en">The data were collected by recording all office visits to the health center doctor during one year. The health center district population amounted 14,500 persons. The total number of persons visiting was 8701 of which a systematic sample of 2540 persons was drawn. Information on the use of services was collected from the patient files using precoded and pretested forms planned for this purpose. This information was supplemented by population data and data of private medical care reimbursements from the sickness insurance registers. The results are mainly presented by pictures relating the use of various services to 1000 persons in the population at risk. The emphasis is on the methodology not in the actual numbers. The results indicate, however, that in 1977 55% of the population visited the health center doctor at least once during the year. More than 90% of those persons who visited were treated exclusively by the health center general practitioners. 13.7% of the population of the district made 50% of the office visits. 4.7% of persons who visited the health center doctor were immediately referred to the central general hospital outpatient department as emergency cases and 0.4% to mental hospital. 5.5% were admitted to the health center hospital ward. Sixteen percent of the population used private medical services either exclusively or simultaneously during the year.</dc:description>
