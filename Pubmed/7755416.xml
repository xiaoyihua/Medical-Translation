<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The role of the muscularis mucosae (MM) of the bladder as a distinct histologic structure has been recently recognized. The prognostic implications of its distinction in patients with T1 bladder cancer is a matter of discussion with possible future implications in the classification of bladder cancer. However, the prevalence of this structure in transurethral resection (TUR) biopsies is unknown. METHODS A retrospective review of 60 bladder biopsies performed by TUR, all deep enough to include smooth muscle, is presented. In 48 cases (80%) superficial urothelial carcinoma (Tis, Ta, Tl) was present, in 9 (15%) biopsy evidenced inflammatory changes, and in 3 (5%) there was no remarkable histologic finding. RESULTS In 25 cases (42%) MM was identified either total or partially and in 14 cases (23%), although absent, its level was suggested by the presence of large vessels in the subepithelial connective tissue. CONCLUSIONS The MM of human urinary bladder can be identified in a high proportion of cases after TUR. The prognostic implications of such distinction are discussed.</dc:description>
