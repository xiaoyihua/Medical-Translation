<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Frailty and low physical activity and cardiorespiratory reserve are related to higher perioperative morbimortality. The crucial step in improving the prognosis is to implement specific measures to optimize these aspects. It is critical to know the magnitude of the problem in order to implement preoperative optimization programmes. OBJECTIVE To characterize surgical population in a university hospital. METHODS All patients undergoing preoperative evaluation for abdominal surgery with admission were prospectively included during a 3-month period. Level of physical activity, functional capacity, frailty and emotional state were assessed using score tests. Additionally, physical condition was evaluated using 5 Times Sit-to-Stand Test. Demographic, clinical and surgical data were collected. RESULTS One hundred and forty patients were included (60±15yr-old, 56% male, 25% ASA III or IV). Forty-nine percent of patients were proposed for oncologic surgery and 13% of which had received neoadjuvant treatment. Seventy percent of patients presented a low functional capacity and were sedentary. Eighteen percent of patients were considered frail and more than 50% completed the 5 Times Sit-to-Stand Test at a higher time than the reference values adjusted to age and sex. Advanced age, ASA III/IV, sedentarism, frailty and a high level of anxiety and depression were related to a lower functional capacity. CONCLUSIONS The surgical population of our area has a low functional reserve and a high index of sedentary lifestyle and frailty, predictors of postoperative morbidity. It is mandatory to implement preoperative measures to identify population at risk and prehabilitation programmes, considered highly promising preventive interventions towards improving surgical outcome.</dc:description>
