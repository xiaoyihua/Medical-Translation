<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify risk factors for dental fluorosis in children between 6 and 15 years. METHODS A cross-sectional survey in 1284 students between 6 and 15 years from four living areas. Presence and degree of dental fluorosis were investigated by using the classification of Dean, tooth decay and variables like source of water consumption, juices, prepared gaseous drinks, tea, types of dental paste used, and periodic applications of fluoride. Descriptive statistics and chi(2) test were applied. RESULTS The prevalence of fluorosis was 52.6 %, (very slight 45.5 %, slight 40.0 %, moderate 11.8 %, and severe 2.6 %). Tooth decay appeared in 52.7 % of the total of cases studied. The variables with more significant differences were the presenting age (the greater fluorosis in children was from 8 to 14 years), tea, juice and prepared gaseous drink consumption, the periodic application of fluoride and the area of residence, varying from 45 to 61 % of fluorosis between the areas of residence. All of these had p &lt; 0.05. CONCLUSIONS Prepared gaseous drink and tea consumption, age in relation to the exhibition of periodic applications of fluoride and the area of residence are the main risk factors for dental fluorosis.</dc:description>
