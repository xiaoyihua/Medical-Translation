<dc:description xml:lang="en">The histologic findings of 325 necropsies of rheumatic patients at the National Institute of Cardiology in Mexico, between 1980-1985 were studied forty five of them had Aschoff nodules plus valvular inflammation-Out of these 45 cases two groups were formed: children-adolescent group (24 cases) and an adult group (21 cases). The clinical, histologic and laboratory findings were compared. Clinical records were reviewed searching for history of rheumatic fever. Active rheumatic fever was suspected in 16 patients in the younger group (67%) and only in 3 adults (14.2%). As far as Jones' criteria is concerned, the most common finding was carditis, principally in the younger group (83%). In the adult group, it appeared in 50% of the patients. All other criteria were only occasionally seen or could not be identified during the patients lifetime. The most common laboratory finding which could suggest active rheumatic fever were: a high levels of anti-streptolysin in younger patients (95%) and elevation of erythro-sedimentation in adults (83%). We conclude that in active rheumatic fever of the adult; Jones criteria are not met, so the illness is difficult to recognize, and there is clinical-histologic discrepancy. In this context the disease has a "silent" evolution.</dc:description>
