<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the health and nutritional status of illegal immigrant adolescents from Maghreb at the time of entry into foster care in Zaragoza, Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS Cross-sectional study over a 3-year period (1997-1999). Health status via clinical history and physical examination was assessed according to standard protocols and individualized complementary laboratory examinations were performed. Nutritional status was assessed using the anthropometric method. Weight, height, head and upper arm circumferences, tricipital and subscapular skinfold thickness, body-mass index and nutritional index were established and compared with national normal standards of reference (Z-score). Student s t-test was used to assess statistically significant differences. RESULTS Forty male adolescents (22 Algerians and 18 Moroccans) were admitted during the study period. Mean age was 15 +/- 1.42 years (range: 13-17 years). Health status: anomaly in at least one body system (50%) and more than one anomaly (15%). Most frequent problems were odontologic (32. 5%), dermatological (17.5%), respiratory (12.5%), ophthalmological (7.5%), orthopedic (5%) and otic (2.5%). Tuberculous infection was detected in 5% and iron deficiency anemia in 2.5% of the patients. Nutritional status: except for head circumference (p &lt; 0.05), no statistically significant differences were found in the other variables analyzed. Mean value of nutritional index was found to be within normal intervals. Individualized analysis showed a mild form of acute malnutrition in 12.5% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS The adolescents studied showed prevalent odontological, dermatological and respiratory diseases due infection and lack of hygienic practices. Deficiency diseases, congenital anomalies and undiagnosed chronic diseases were observed in a small number of patients. Concerning nutritional status, a low percentage of patients showed a mild form of acute malnutrition, probably related to food deprivation and poor dietary habits experienced during the immigration process. Chronic malnutrition was not observed.</dc:description>
