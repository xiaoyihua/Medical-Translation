<dc:description xml:lang="en">CASE REPORT We report the case of a 60-year-old woman with recurrent dacryocystitis of the right lacrimal sac. She did not recover after medical treatment, nor after dacryocystorhinostomy with canalicular intubation. She also had dacryocystitis on the left side. The material that was obtained during surgery was grown in a culture medium and Candida Lusitaniae was identified as the responsible organism. All symptoms disappeared after topical treatment with amphotericin B and dacryocystorhinostomy. DISCUSSION Dacryocystitis caused by Candida Lusitaniae is very rare. We should always consider whether Candida Lusitaniae is responsible for the primary infection or is the agent resulting from a superadded infection caused by previous antibiotic therapy.</dc:description>
