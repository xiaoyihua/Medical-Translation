<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyze the information that women have on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the sources of this information and how it is related to prescription. METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study through a telephone survey. Information was collected on prescription of HRT, knowledge of HRT and of its health benefits, risks and type of risk, and sources of information. RESULTS 371 interviews (80% of the original sample) were completed. 66% of the sample reported knowledge of the benefits of HRT and 42% learnt of them from health professionals. 36% thought that HRT could pose health risks. 91% of the women prescribed this treatment reported knowledge of its benefits compared with 57% of those not prescribed it (OR = 7.32; 95% CI, 2.86-18.74). Health professionals were the main source of information about these benefits among women prescribed HRT (93%) (OR = 83,47; 95% CI, 26.83-278.63). 57% of the women prescribed HRT reported knowledge of its risks compared with 28% of those not prescribed this therapy (OR = 3.11; 95% CI, 1.59-6.05). CONCLUSIONS Women prescribed HRT were better informed than those not prescribed this therapy. Among users, more than 90% mentioned some benefits, but 43% reported not knowing about its risks. Information on the benefits of HRT was mainly provided by health professionals whereas information on the risks was provided by both health professionals and the mass media.</dc:description>
