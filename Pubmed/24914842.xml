<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The difficulty in predicting indolent prostate cancer leads to the use of different inclusion criteria in an active surveillance (AS) program. This chapter presents the pathology findings of radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients whose disease meet criteria for AS, as well as of those who are operated during AS. METHODS Two independent Medline searches were conducted, both of them with a double objective: pathological findingsin radical prostatectomy specimens of patients who could have been included in AS and pathological features of patients operated after an AS period. The following terms were used for the research: "prostaticneoplasm", "radical prostatectomy" and "active surveillance": "radical prostatectomy", "after", "following" and "active surveillance". Pathological findings in radical prostatectomy specimens, down staging and downgrading rates were recorded. Active surveillance length and reason for surgery was included when it was available. RESULTS Depending on different AS inclusion criteria, clinical downgrading rate (pathological Gleason &gt; 6) varied between 12.1 and 61% and clinical downstaging between 0-26%. Pathological Gleason score =8 was reported in 0-7.8% and there were anecdotal findings of seminal vesicle invasion or positive nodes. Overall, unfavorable pathology (Gleason ≥ 7 or stage ≥ pT3)was detected in 13.1-42.4%, based on different definitions. The criteria at John Hopkins were the strictest and had the lowest clinical downgrading and downstaging. On the other hand, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center(MSKCC) criteria had the highest risk of unfavorable pathology but had the highest recruitment capacity. Indolent tumor was observed in 70-82.2% according to the current definition. The average duration in AS prior to surgery was 15-37 months. pT3 stage was seen in 7.7-36.7%, Gleason score 3+4 in 18.6-42.9%, Gleason score 4+3 in 1.4-31.8%, Gleason score &gt;7 in 0-10.3%, positive margins in 3-40.9%. Seminal vesicle invasion rate was extremely low (0-2.9%) as well as positive nodes (0-4.5%). CONCLUSIONS Although there is a low risk of clinical downstaging and downgrading between patients who have being included in AS, it remains feasible. The probability of predicting an indolent tumor depends greatly on the quality of the prostate biopsy and/or the confirmatory biopsy. On the other hand, most patients who progress in an AS program can have a high probability of cure. We are still in the early stages of AS management in order to be able to predict the biological behavior and the cure rate of radical prostatectomy in patients after a long AS period.</dc:description>
