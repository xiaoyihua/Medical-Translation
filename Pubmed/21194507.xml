<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the clinical competence with influenza A H1N1 after an e-learning educational strategy based on the influenza A H1N1 clinical practice guideline. METHODS An observational analytical study which included 860 students who responded to the assessment instrument (consistency of 0.89) at the beginning and end of phases IV to VII of the e-learning mode course about the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of influenza A H1N1. Nonparametric statistics were used. RESULTS We included 25% of students admitted to phases IV to VII of the course. There was no statistical difference between the groups at the beginning evaluation. The 94.76% of the students were in the lower ranks. After the educational intervention 54.64% of students were located at intermediate or higher values. Critics to previous actions of colleagues and commitment of iatrogenic events were indicators that did not show an increase. A raise in the initial score was shown in 646 students, 122 declined and 88 remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS An e-learning strategy seems to develop adequate skills for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of influenza A H1N1.</dc:description>
