<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Ablative procedures are still frequent for the surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the P300 component has been used to assess cognitive changes induced by levodopa and deep brain stimulation (DBS), the effects caused by unilateral pallidotomy remain unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS P300 amplitude and latency in 10 PD patients who underwent unilateral pallidotomy with and without levodopa treatment were compared with 10 healthy controls. Measurements in patients were performed 6 months before and after surgery while only once in controls, throughout the 6-month lapse between the comparative measurements performed in patients. RESULTS Statistical differences in P300 amplitude and latency were found between the control and PD groups (p &lt; 0.001). On the other hand, there were no differences between the groups with the use of the levodopa treatment or surgery. DISCUSSION Lack of statistically significant results after six months of pallidotomy or treatment with levodopa suggests an absence of cognitive impairment. Our results obtained with P300 in which safety of surgical treatment has been assessed in PD are consistent with those of other procedures, such as DBS.</dc:description>
