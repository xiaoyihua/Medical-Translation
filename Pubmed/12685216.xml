<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the cases of rotavirus infection occurred in Yucatan, Mexico, in the year 2000. MATERIAL AND METHODS From January to May 2000, were studied 668 patients with acute infectious diarrhea and their fecal samples. A questionnaire was applied and the samples were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver stained. Incidence rates and the frequency of clinical manifestations were calculated. RESULTS The cases of rotavirus occurred from January to April 2000. Three hundred-thirty seven (50.45%) samples were positives. The higher incidence rate of 0.70% was observed in infants 6 to 8 months of age. Vomit, nausea and hyperthermia were the more frequent clinical manifestations. Abdominal pain and dehydration occurred in 45.9% and 41.8% of the cases respectively. CONCLUSIONS Presentation of the cases was similar to the reported by the countries with tempered climate. The risk of becoming ill by rotavirus was greater in the children under 1 year of age. Abdominal pain requires be carefully explored. Surveillance of the cases must be carried out throughout the year.</dc:description>
