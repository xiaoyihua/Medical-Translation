<dc:description xml:lang="en">Inflammatory bowel disease is an entity with not wellknown pathogenesis, and important nutritional and metabolic implications because of the high prevalence of malnutrition, the possible implication of dietary factors in its pathogenesis and because of the hypothesis that nutritional intervention could be a primary treatment for the disease. Some nutrients could induce a low antigenic stimuli, regulate inflammatory and immunological responses and stimulate intestinal mucosal trophism. Present available evidence supports enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease as a primary treatment if treatment with steroids is not possible (failure or contraindication) (grade of recommendation A) or either combined treatment with drugs in malnourished patients or those with inflammatory bowel stenosis. In those patients with sustained clinical remission, no benefit of either enteral nutrition or supplements in the absence of nutritional deficits has been shown. Elemental or modified formula (glutamine, omega 3 fatty acids) could not be recommended. In ulcerative colitis, nutritional influence over the activity of the disease has not been shown, although there are some promising results regarding enteric coated W3 fatty acids and a possible role for probiotics. In the treatment and prevention of pouchitis, there could be a role for probiotics (VSL#3). Nutritional treatment should be considered an integral component in the Management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</dc:description>
