<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the risk factors in asthmatics patients with high blood pressure (HBP). METHODS This was an observational, retrospective, and comparative clinical study, with 132 subjects, divided in 2 groups, sex and age paired. 66 patients with asthma and HBP, and 66 with HBP only as a control group. RESULTS We identified 69.69% females, age groups from 37-69 years, average 32. Asthma evolution ranged from 1-50 years average 9.60 and HBP evolution ranged from 1-40 years, average 12.21. Hereditary risks allergy were 34.84% (P = NS), pets indoors 16.55% (P = NS), home carpets 16.66% (P = NS), smoking 42.42% (P = 0.001), feather pillows 10.60% (P = NS), 51.51% patients had different diseases beside asthma and HBP (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION Asthma and HBP are chronic diseases that require a surveillance long period. Consequently, it is necessary early risk factors diagnosis to design strategies to do in a positive form, breaking the health-disease chain. Smoking and the presence of other disease factors were significatives, limiting the quality of life of these patients.</dc:description>
