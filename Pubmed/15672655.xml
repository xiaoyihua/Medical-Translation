<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Polyunsaturated fatty acids play a key role in a huge number of biological functions. Western diets are highly rich in w-6 fatty acids. However the content of w-3 fatty acids is not suitable in those diets, despite of their importance in normal development of the human body and regulation of immune response. The aim of this work is to examine the effect of w-3 fatty acids enriched diet in the regulation of inflammatory response. MATERIAL AND METHODS Balb/c mice were fed either w-6 fatty acids rich diet (100% sunflower oil) or w-3 fatty acids fortified diet (12% fish oil plus 88% sunflower oil) during 28 days. Twelve hours prior to sacrifice, the mice were treated with 2,4-ninitro-1-fluorobezene on the left ear to induce the inflammatory reaction. Afterwards the mice were sacrificed and the different samples collected were analized. RESULTS Ear inflammation of mice fed the w-3 diet was significantly lower. Leukocyte infiltration and oxidative stress were also lower in those mice. To explain these results, cytokine expression and plasma eicosanoid concentration were measured. An increase in IL-10 levels and a down regulation of Th1 and Th2 responses were observed in mice fed the w-3 diet. CONCLUSION Not only n-3 fatty acids exerts an antiinflammatory and an antialergical role but also they enhance some of the organism defenses. Our data suggest that w-3 fatty acids downregulate the inflammatory response by enhancing IL10 expression.</dc:description>
