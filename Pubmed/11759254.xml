<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Montelukast is a specific antagonist of leukotrienes' receptors and constitutes a therapeutic option in controlling asthma. OBJECTIVES To evaluate efficacy of montelukast in patients with persistent light asthma, persistent moderate asthma and exercise-induced asthma; to try to reduce or to eliminate doses of inhaled steroid; to reduce the use of short-action beta agonists and to assess its tolerability in pediatric patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD 40 patients were studied, 17 female, with an age range from 4 to 11 years and a mean of 7 years. Stratification was made by GINA-established parameters. RESULTS Steroid dose could be reduced in 88%, with definitive suspension in 66% of patients. Moreover, an improvement in reducing asthma stratification and the use of rescue drugs were registered. 62% of patients with exercise-induced asthma improved and there was a good tolerance with the same side effects.</dc:description>
