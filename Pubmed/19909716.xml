<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND GOALS Congenital lachrymal obstruction is a frequent motive of consultation. Endoscopic control in the inferior meatus of the nostril allows to realize surgical controlled procedures. The aim of the study is to analyze the result obtained in the treatment of congenital obstruction of the lachrymal duct by monocanalicular intubation with Monoka and endoscopic control in children who had failed two lachrymal system probings. METHODS Between October 2004 and September 2008 this technique was performed in a prospective study on 36 patients with congenital nasolacrimal obstruction who had failed two lachrymal system probings. The mean age was 36.2 months (range 12-66 months). Patients were followed at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months, with clinical evaluation by Munk's score and ophthalmologic exam using dye disappearance test. Success was defined as complete resolution of signs and symptoms (Munk 0) and no fluorescein remaining in dye disappearance test (grade 0). RESULTS The procedure was successful in 91.66% of the cases and acceptable in 8.33%. We have not found any complication or side effects, and not further procedures have been needed on any patient. CONCLUSIONS Balloon dachryoplasty with monocanalicular intubation under endoscopic control is a safe, easy to perform and effective surgical technique for the treatment of congenital lachrymal obstruction with two previous failed lachrymal system probings.</dc:description>
