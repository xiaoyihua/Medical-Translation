<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Gorlin-Goltz syndrome is a dominant autosomic disorder characterized by cancerigenic predisposition and multiple development defects, apparently without reproductive compromise. The complex is characterized by four primary symptoms, which include nevoid basal cell epitheliomas malignantly prone, keratocystic jaw, skeletal abnormalities and intracranial calcifications. Apparently, reproductive problems reported had been rarely associated with this syndrome. We present the case of a patient with clinic stigmatae of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, who had a characteristic progress as seen in the literature; he was the fifth product of a 43 year-old female (father was 48 years old); who at birth disclosed right eye microftalmy, bilateral cryptorchidism surgically treated at age of six. At puberty, an odontogenic cyst of the jaw was noted and enucleated. He also showed facial nevi in neck, thorax and abdomen. When he was admitted being 14 years old in our clinic, he had recurrent bilateral cryptorchidism, sexual immatturity and infertility. It is important to take into consideration Gorlin-Goltz stigmatae in cases of hypogonadism in order to recognize a further genetic influence.</dc:description>
