<dc:description xml:lang="en">The ventricular septal defect (VSD) may close spontaneously in the first few years of life. The closure occurs by muscle's growth of the borders of the defect or by the appearance of an aneurysm of ventricular septum composed mostly by tricuspid tissue. We believe that the two-dimensional echocardiography is the best method to determine the mechanisms that take part in the aneurysm formation. The study was carried out on 58 patients with aneurysms of ventricular septum observed in 230 patients with ventricular septal defects. 29 were male and 29 were female patients. The mean age at the time of diagnosis of aneurysm was 30 months (range 1 month-13 years). Forty seven patients had a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (perimembranous inlet 29, perimembranous trabecular nine, perimembranous outlet nine and of mixed's type seven), muscular defect nine (muscular inlet seven, and muscular trabecular two) and VSD closed in two. The size of the defect was 0.47 +/- 0.2 cm (range 0.2-1.1). In 16 the defect was larger than 0.6 cm. Thirty two patients had associated anomalies. On study the aneurysm in relation with tricuspid valve leaflets: in 27 cases (46.3%), the aneurysm was entirely formed by tricuspid septal leaflets tissue (17 had perimembranous ventricular septal defect and seven muscular), in eight (13.6) the aneurysm had tricuspid valve leaflets and interventricular component of the membranous septum tissue (five perimembranous defect and two muscular) and in another 16 cases membranous septum tissue only. In 7 patients the origin of the aneurysm wasn't confirmed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
