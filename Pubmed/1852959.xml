<dc:description xml:lang="en">We have performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical, echocardiographic, surgical and necropsy data in 40 patients affected by infective endocarditis complicated by paravalvular abscess. The abscess developed on prosthetic valve in 13 cases, and on native valve in 27. Aortic valve was the most affected (85%). The clinical course was considered to be acute in 52% of the patients. Fever persisted despite of adequate antibiotic therapy in 57%. In 90%, overt heart failure were present. Staphylococcus were the most frequent causative microorganism (S. aureus, 22.5%; S. epidermidis, 20%). Bundle branch or atrioventricular block were detected in 18 patients (sensibility, 45%; specificity, 88%). Bidimensional echocardiography, along with Doppler techniques when necessary, detected an abscess in 81% of patients (sensibility, 80%; specificity, 84%). Thirty patients were operated. Eight of them (26%) died, two intraoperatively. Ten patients were not operated and nine died (90%). The difference was significant (p less than 0.001). Only age and surgical treatment were related to early survival. Over the follow-up of the operated patients, five presented prosthetic dehiscence, but only two required a new operation 3 months after the first intervention, and none died. In conclusion, the detection of a paravalvular abscess complicating an infective endocarditis is an indication for surgical treatment. Both surgical mortality and postoperative prosthetic dehiscence are acceptable. Bidimensional echocardiography is the most reliable tool for the diagnosis of this complication.</dc:description>
