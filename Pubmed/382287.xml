<dc:description xml:lang="en">A systematically organized synopsis involving a numerical estimate of different taxons (a quantitative analysis per Prosobranchia and Pulmonata subclass families) is presented. Major groups regarding the number of species and/or subspecific types were determined. Among ground prosobranchiates a marked predominance of the Pomatiasidae family (about 360 species), Helicinidae family (about 80 species) and Cyclophoridae family (about 32 species) was found. Among pulmonates, Urocoptidae family and Ceriidae, family were the highest diverse ones; the latter involved a single markedly polymorphic genus with almost 150 types. The Helicacoae superfamily as well as the Tructicicolidae and Camaenidae families were highly satisfactorily represented.</dc:description>
