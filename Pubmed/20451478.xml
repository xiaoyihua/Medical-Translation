<dc:description xml:lang="en">Numerous epidemiological and prospective studies have shown a direct relationship between total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular morbidity and mortality). In many intervention studies with more than 100,000 subjects, statins have shown a powerful and significant reduction of cardiovascular events and a decrease in cardiovascular and overall mortality, far superior to those produced by any other lipid-lowering group. Consequently statins are considered to be safe and well tolerated and are the first choice in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and in cardiovascular disease prevention. If targets are not reached, other pharmacological groups must be associated (resins, nicotinic acid, ezetimibe, fibrates, etc.). Moreover, when hypercholesterolemia is associated with low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and high triglyceride levels, the association of statins with nicotinic acid, fibrates or omega-3 should be considered. Some questions remain to be answered: what LDL-C levels are desirable in secondary prevention? Which individuals might benefit from treatment in primary prevention? Which lipid-lowering drug is the most suitable to combine with statins and diminish cardiovascular risk in each situation? The present article reviews these important points.</dc:description>
