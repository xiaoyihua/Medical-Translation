<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To evaluate the efficacy and pharmacological safety of 2 therapeutic trials with fluconazole in candida esophagitis in AIDS patients. METHODS A total of 75 episodes of candida esophagitis in 70 AIDS patients were included in an open prospective study. In group I 36 patients were included who received 200 mg of fluconazole orally the first day followed by 100 mg daily for 4 weeks. In group II (34 patients) the length of treatment was reduced to 10 days with the same daily doses. Therapeutic response was evaluated by esophagoscopy, biopsy and fungal culture. RESULTS The protocol was completed at 68 episodes with a cure being obtained in all but 2 patients in group II. No significant differences in clinical response were found between the 2 groups. The incidence of oropharyngeal colonization at the end of treatment was greater in patients from group I than from group II (43% vs 11%). Fluconazole was well tolerated in all the patients. A slight alteration of the hepatic enzymes was observed in 29 cases (40%) with a lower incidence in the shorter time group (p less than 0.001), however, treatment was discontinued only in 1 patient because of severe asymptomatic hepatic dysfunction to which a relation with the drug is unclear. CONCLUSIONS Fluconazole in an efficient and safe agent in the treatment of candida esophagitis in AIDS patients. A 10 day treatment is a useful as longer treatment and has a lower risk of adverse effects.</dc:description>
