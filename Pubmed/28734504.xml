<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine whether family variables, such as type of relationship, years of marriage, existence of offspring, number of members of family, stage of family life cycle, transition between stages, perceived social support, and/or stressful life events are related to conjugal adjustment. DESIGN A cross-sectional and correlational study using questionnaires. LOCATION Primary care and hospital units of selected centres in the province of Seville, Spain. PARTICIPANTS Consecutive stratified sampling by quotas of 369 heterosexual couples over 18years of age, who maintained a relationship, with or without children, living in Seville. MAIN MEASUREMENTS A self-report questionnaire for the sociodemographic variables, and the abbreviated version of the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, Questionnaire MOS Perceived Social Support, and Social Readjustment Rating Scale, were used. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed with correlation analysis and multivariate regression. RESULTS Statistically significant associations were found between conjugal adjustment and marriage years (r=-10: P&lt;.05), stage of family life cycle (F=2.65; P&lt;.05), the transition between stages (RPB=.11; P&lt;.05) and perceived social support (r=.44; P&lt;.001). The regression model showed the predictive power of perceived social support and the family life cycle stage (mature-aged stage) on conjugal adjustment (R2=.21; F=9.9; df=356; P&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS Couples may be assessed from Primary Care and be provide with resources and support. In addition, it can identify variables that may help improve the conjugal relationship.</dc:description>
