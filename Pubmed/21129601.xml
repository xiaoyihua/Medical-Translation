<dc:description xml:lang="en">Surgical activity is one of the major causes of iatrogeny. All surgery carries an inherent risk of complications, whether in emergency surgery or in simpler elective procedures. Because of the progressive increase in life expectancy, surgical techniques are increasingly used in the elderly, with a consequent rise in the possibility of catastrophic complications. Intimately related to the surgical intervention is the anesthetic technique. The present article reviews the most frequent neurological complications of anesthetic techniques and the types of surgery most commonly associated with central or peripheral nervous system complications. Neurologists are well versed in the complications associated with neurosurgery and carotid artery surgery. Other types of surgery, such as cardiac surgery, liver transplantation, bariatric surgery or aortic aneurism surgery, are also potential sources of complications.</dc:description>
