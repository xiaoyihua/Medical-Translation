<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cerebellar mutism is an infrequent but important complication after posterior fossa surgery in children. Dysarthria, irritability and ataxia are among the signs and symptoms of this disorder, which are usually mild and self-limiting. However, in severe cases, there can be impairment of higher-level cognitive functions, affecting the child's future personal and social relations. This disorder has been described in many other situations and consequently pediatricians should be familiar with its symptoms, physiopathology, diagnosis, degrees of severity, treatment, and prognosis, since a multidisciplinary approach is required. We present the case of a 5-year-old boy who underwent surgery for a low-grade ependymoma in the fourth ventricle; 48 hours after surgical resection, the boy developed irritability, cranial nerve involvement and stereotyped movements in the context of active hydrocephalus. His symptoms progressively improved 6 weeks after the intervention. We review the literature on cerebellar mutism and discuss the physiopathology of this disorder, which seems to confirm that the cerebellum not only acts as a simple coordinator of motor function, but also plays an important role in higher-level cognitive functions, such as language.</dc:description>
