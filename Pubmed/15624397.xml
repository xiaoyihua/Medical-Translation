<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyze the efficacy of varicocele treatment, either surgical or endovoscular radiological occlusion, on pregnancy rates of infertile couples in which the male had clinically. patent left varicocele, and to identify which factors are associated with the probability of obtaining pregnancy in such cases. METHODS This study is part of a more ample one described in previous article: "The treatment of varicocele in the infertile male I: Results on semen quality". Overall, 183 couples were included. 157 males received treatment (131 radiological occlusion and 26 open surgery), the remaining 26 did not received the treatment indicated. Couples underwent periodic follow-up during the first year, evaluating two parameters: 1) normalization of semen analysis parameters, and 2) pregnancy during the following 12 months after indication of treatment. RESULTS Overall, 41 couples (22.4%) achieved pregnancy during first year, 35/157 (22%) in the group of treated patients, and 6/26 (23%) in the non treatment group. In the treatment group, surgical ligature achieved higher pregnancy rates than radiological occlusion (35% vs. 20%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.255). No association was demonstrated between male age, female age, varicocele clinical grade, degree of semen quality abnormalities, or duration of infertility and pregnancy rates. The FSH value was significantly lower (p 0.0006) in patients who achieved pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS The degree of semen quality abnormality, which so closely correlated to normalization of seminal parameters, locked of prognostic significance in terms of achievement of pregnancy. The FSH value was the only factor with certain prognostic value, although it did not reach significance in logistic regression analysis.</dc:description>
