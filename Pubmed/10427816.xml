<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyze our results in the surgery of the stress urinary incontinence in women with the Raz's techniques, to assess the association among continence and factors like surgical technique, grade of incontinence and urethral pressure profile. MATERIAL AND METHODS We do a retrospective study of 88 operations in 81 patients between the first of January 1990 and the thirty-one of December 1998. We describe the patients, previous treatments, grade of incontinence ans urodynamics data. We analyze the pre and post-operative complications. The outcome is evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the results are compared by the log rank test. RESULTS 11 patients had a previous surgery and 7 had done physiotherapy; the grade of incontinence was 1 in 7 patients, 2 in 56 and 3 in 18. There were neither significative difference between UPP and abdominal leak point pressure and grade of incontinence nor between those parameters and continence. We did the Raz 1 technique in 67 patients, Raz 2 in 3, Raz 3 in 18. There were no significant difference among them. There are a progressive loose in the continence rate along the two first years; after that the continence rates are stabilized about 75%. The complications rate was scarce, except for the postoperative urinary retention, that reached the 20.45%. CONCLUSIONS Our results are similar to those cited in the bibliography, mainly in the Spanish one. The highest rate of failure is in the two first years.</dc:description>
