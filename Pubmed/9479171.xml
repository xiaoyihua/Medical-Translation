<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two induced labor methods, the venoclysis with oxitocin and the self-stimulation of the nipples, were comparatively evaluated in 2 groups of pregnant women (80) admitted at the Eastern Gyneco-obstetric and Teaching Hospital in Santiago de Cuba during the first semester of 1993. The following variables were calculated: drugs intake, material expenses, length of stay, and quality. A questionnaire was used to collect them. Percent and chi square were applied to these data, which were represented by tables. The self-stimulation of the nipples proved to be the most economical as regards the saving os spendable material and drugs. Hospital stay and the perinatal results connected with the type of labor and the newborn status were similar with both methods.</dc:description>
