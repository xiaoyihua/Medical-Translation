<dc:description xml:lang="en">The professional recognition and sanitary reforms that physicians sought from the political powers throughout the constitutional era of the reign of Alfonso XIII were a continuation of those from the XIXth century. One of the most important demands was that rural physicians should answer directly to the State, especially with reference to salaries, rather than to municipal authorities generally held by caciques. There were constant problems between them. This work presents the case of the physician from El Pobo, Alfredo Alegre, whose conviction put health professionals, students and most of society on the warpath, joining their demands to a petition for pardon. This tragic story, apart from showing the importance of the daily press as a source, highlights the difficulties offered by professional practice in rural areas submerged in the past and the inability of politicians to resolve problems during one of the most hectic periods of our history.</dc:description>
