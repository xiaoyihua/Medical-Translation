<dc:description xml:lang="en">A transversal epidemiological study was carried out to discover the most important cardiovascular risk factors in the child population of Asturias, Spain. The study took place over a period of 4 years (1987-91) and consisted of a representative sample of boys and girls (6-13 years of age) from different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Biochemical factors (serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, serum triglycerides and glucose) and anthropometric measures to evaluate obesity were analysed. Hypercholesterolemia appeared to be the most prevalent risk factor with a prevalence of 38.27% and a mean value of 178.31 mg/dl, followed by obesity (15.58%), hypertriglyceridemia (14.05%) and hyperglycemia (0.77%). Risk factors were more frequent in girls than boys, and in younger children in relation to older ones. Hypercholesterolemia and obesity were more prevalent in children from an urban environment while hypertriglyceridemia was the main risk factor in those from a rural one. Considering the high prevalence of the evaluated risk factors, the prevention and control of such is of extreme importance in leading children to becoming healthy adults.</dc:description>
