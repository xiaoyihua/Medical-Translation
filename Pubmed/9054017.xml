<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics of hospital utilization by the elderly in three hospitals in Mexico City during 1992 and 1993. Main reason for admission, average length of stay and type of treatment received were some of the variables studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS A random sample of 820 clinical files were selected, 308 from the Instituto Nacional de la Nutrición Salvador Zubirán (INNSZ), 189 from the Hospital General Manuel Gea González (HGMGG) and 323 from the Hospital Regional Adolfo López Mateos (HRALM). The principal reasons for admission, average days spent in the hospital and type of treatment received were identified for patients 60 years and older. Univariate and bivariate analysis was performed with hypothesis test for differences between sexes. RESULTS Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the principal reasons for admission length of stay varied considerably and was the longest at the INNSZ (median: 12 days) and the shortest at the HRALM (median: 8 days). Most of the patients were admitted through the emergency service, except in the INNSZ where most came for ambulatory visit.</dc:description>
