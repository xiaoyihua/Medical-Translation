<dc:description xml:lang="en">The 45 main authors of articles on psychiatry from 1901 to 1931 are studied together using a repertory of the author as a source. It contains the psychiatric production in 32 important Spanish medical journals in that time. The following variables have been considered for the collective biographical analysis of the authors: year and place of birth, universities where they studied, institutions for their professional practising, cities for their professional residence, medical specialty, professional position, number of original articles on the subjects of psychiatry published and contained in the reference repertory, productivity index and signatures per work index. We can say that 0.2 of the prolific authors were born from 1880 to 1889 and 0.2888 of them were from Madrid and Barcelona. In those cities, 0.3334 of them studied Medicine and 0.6444 of them lived there; 0.6 of them worked in hospitals and 0.2222 of them worked in madhouses. Most of them were neuropsychiatrists. The occasional producers were 0.6908 of them and the reports with only one signer were 0.9492 of the total. Abdón Sánchez Herrero was the greatest producer on the specialty with 348 articles.</dc:description>
