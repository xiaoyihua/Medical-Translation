<dc:description xml:lang="en">Intravascular ultrasound is a new promising technique that appears as a very useful complement to standard angiography in the study of atherosclerosis. Specifically, intravascular ultrasound provides by itself, information of great value concerning vessel wall characteristics. Nevertheless, before taking any decision with the results provided by this new technique, we must validate this information with that provided by other more conventional techniques like standard angiography. Accordingly, we have analyzed in 25 patients, 50 images of the abdominal aorta and 77 images of the coronary arteries taken from arterial segments free of atherosclerotic involvement. With the use of a calibrated small grid located over the patient's thorax, we have analyzed "in the same points" the images obtained with intravascular ultrasound and those provided by contrast angiography using a quantitative angiographic analysis. In the abdominal aorta the vessel diameter measured by intravascular ultrasound and angiography was 17.8 +/- 0.39 mm vs 18.6 +/- 0.42 mm (NS), whereas in the coronary arteries it was 2.76 +/- 0.39 mm vs 2.98 +/- 0.37 mm (NS), respectively. The correlation between both techniques was good for both types of arteries (r = 0.93 in the abdominal aorta and r = 0.87 in the coronary arteries). We conclude, that in our experience and with the methodology used, there is a good correlation between the measurements of the vessel diameters obtained by both intravascular ultrasound and digital angiography in arteries of different sizes, being the correlation even better in large arteries.</dc:description>
