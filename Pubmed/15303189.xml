<dc:description xml:lang="en">This research aimed to identify and analyze the protection factors and risks associated with alcohol use in adolescents between 12 and 18 years old, whose parents are addicted to alcohol. This is a quantitative and exploratory study. Data were collected by means of the Drug Use Screening Inventory (DUSI), which to quantify and categorize substance abuse indices with respect to physical, work and family conditions; peer relations and relation with the academician. Adolescents whose parents are addicted to alcohol demonstrated and in some cases even intoxication, but without a frequent use pattern. The risks and protection factors with respect to alcohol use among adolescents are associated, to a lesser or greater extent, with the behavior of family members and friends, as well as with the social context the youngsters are inserted in.</dc:description>
