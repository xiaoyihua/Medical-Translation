<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The incidence of post transfusional hepatitis (PTH) after the exclusion of anti-HCV ELISA 2 positive donors is not well known. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and type of PTH in 113 post transfused patients. METHODS A post transfusional follow up was performed for at least one year with periodic controls of transaminase levels. When an increase in GPT level compatible with PTH was demonstrated investigation of all the virus related with the transfusion was carried out in both the donor and the transfused subject: HAV, HCV, HEV, HBV and CMV. RESULTS Four cases (3.5%) were detected which fulfilled the PTH criteria with the following characteristics: short period of time between transfusion and the increase in GPT level, moderate GPT increase, moderate clinical expression and good evolution. In all the cases the viral study was negative and other non viral possibilities were eliminated. CONCLUSIONS Transfusions are currently relatively safe and the increase in transaminases may not be related with transfusion.</dc:description>
