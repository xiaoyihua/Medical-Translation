<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To determine the diagnostic value of lacunar folds study in patients with dry eye syndrome. METHODS We present a prospective study in 185 patients (91 males and 94 females). In all patients the abduction degree was measured after instilling a fluorescein drop, which makes lacunar folds disappear. We divided patients into two groups, one of them with dry eye symptoms and the other without them. The symptomatic group was divided into four other subgroups, according to the severity of symptoms. RESULTS We found significant differences in the early disappearing of lacunar folds in dry eye patients compared with the control group. The folds disappeared quicker when the symptoms were more severe. The disappearance of folds is significantly associated with the Schirmer test and with the break up time test (BUT). CONCLUSIONS Lacunar folds study should be included as a useful and easy test in the diagnosis of dry eye syndrome, nevertheless its disappearance is not exclusive of this disease.</dc:description>
