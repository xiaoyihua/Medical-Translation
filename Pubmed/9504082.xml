<dc:description xml:lang="en">Colonization factor antigens (CFAs and PCFs) are important virulence factors of Escherichia coli (ETEC) diarrhea. Antibodies to CFAs produced after ETEC infection are protective; however, the CFA epitopes which induce protective antibodies have not yet been characterized. This study is the characterization of the immune response to CFAs at molecular level and identification of the epitopes associated with inhibition of cell-adherence and protection that will lead to the development of methods to prevent ETEC infection and disease. The aim of this study was the characterization of the linear epitopes of CFA/I that react with sera from acute and convalescent phase of ETEC-in-fected children, with adult sera from endemic and non-endemic areas, with monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) and with hyperimmune antiserum to CFAs and PCFs different from CFA/I. Three linear and common epitopes were recognized among the CFA/I in child sera and adult sera from endemic areas and with hyperimmune sera against other known CFAs and putative ETEC colonization factors.</dc:description>
