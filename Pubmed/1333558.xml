<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to analyze the results obtained in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with the PAVI chemotherapy protocol (cisplatin, adriamycin, etoposide and ifosfamide). METHODS Over a period of 3 years, 41 patients with a mean age of 57 years were treated. Twenty-two patients were considered as having limited disease (LD) and 19 disseminated disease (DD). Survival was studied by the Kaplan and Meier method. RESULTS The percentage of complete response (CR) achieved was 42%, LD 52% and 27% for DD, with partial responses (PR) being achieved in 50%, 43% in LD and 60% in DD. With a mean follow up of 32 months, the mean 2 length of response was 13 months in the patients with CR and 9 months in those with PR. The median of survival in LD was 22 months and 10 months for patients with DD. Prolonged survival of over 2 years, was only achieved in LD (16%). Five patients died in relation with the treatment. Hematologic toxicity was doses-limited with the greatest toxicity being found in patients with DD under the Karnofsky index (KI). CONCLUSIONS The PAVI protocol is effective in the treatment of small cell lung cancer and a good median of survival may be achieved in patients with limited disease. Toxicity is elevated and is fundamentally found in patients with disseminated disease and under the Karnofsky index, with its use not being recommended in these cases.</dc:description>
