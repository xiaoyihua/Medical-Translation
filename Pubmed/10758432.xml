<dc:description xml:lang="en">The dual-isotope technique (rest 201Tl and stress 99mTc-sestamibi) is useful to assess myocardial perfusion in coronary disease patients. 99mTc-labeled tetrofosmin is a radiopharmaceutical whose characteristics are similar to sestamibi. Thus, we decided to use it to detect reversible myocardial hypoperfusion in patients with a background of myocardial infarction and ischemia. A sequential dual-isotope scintigraphy (3 mCi rest 201Tl and 25 mCi stress 99mTc-tetrofosmin) with 24-hour 201Tl redistribution (RD) was performed in 20 patients with previously confirmed myocardial infarction and clinical and ergometric signs of ischemia. Each patient also underwent a stress-redistribution protocol with redistribution at 4 and 24 hours post injection with 201Tl scintigraphy within two weeks of the first study. The qualitative uptake analysis showed no significant differences in the number of myocardial segments with severe reduction of tracer uptake on stress that improved at rest or in RD images, even if 24-hour RD images were considered. The quantitative global uptake analysis showed a similar defect reversibility with both protocols; however if 24-hour RD images were considered the uptake improvement was significant only when compared with the rest 201Tl images in dual-isotope scintigraphy protocol (75+/-8% vs. 81+/-9% of peak activity, rest vs. 24-hour RD; p&lt;0.01) and not when compared with the 4-hour RD in the 201Tl scintigraphy. On the other hand, when only the segments with severely reduced uptake (&lt;50% of peak activity) were analyzed, the 24-hour RD improved myocardial uptake significantly (p&lt;0.001 vs. rest and vs 4-hour RD) in both protocols. We conclude that a sequential dual-isotope rest 201Tl/stress 99mTc-tetrofosmin scintigraphy is comparable with stress-redistribution 201Tl scintigraphy to detect reversible myocardial hypoperfusion; however in both cases, the addition of 24-hour images increases its usefulness in severely hypoperfused segments, if the uptake of the radiopharmaceutic is quantified.</dc:description>
