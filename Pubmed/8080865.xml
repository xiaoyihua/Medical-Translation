<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Streptococci group A is the most frequently isolated pathogen in the cases of acute pharyngotonsilitis in school-aged children. Hemolytic streptococci B, which are not of group A, have recently been described as a cause of pharyngotonsilitis. A study was carried out in school children in primary school with the aim of knowing the frequency of the state of pharyngeal carriers of streptococci in groups A, B, C and G. METHODS A total of 347 children with ages ranging from 4 to 14 years of age were included in the study in which a pharyngeal exudate was obtained to investigate the presence of hemolytic streptococci B. RESULTS The prevalence of streptococci group A in all the age groups studied was of 11.52% being significantly greater (40.47%) among children of preschool age (4-6 years). The prevalence of streptococci group C was 2.3% with no carriers of groups B or G being observed. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study are in agreement with the literature reviewed in which asymptomatic carriers of streptococci group A were found to be principally school aged children who are those who most frequently have acute pharyngotonsilitis. Neither the pathogenicity of hemolytic streptococci B, which are not of group A, nor their epidemiologic implications are totally clear.</dc:description>
