<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Marjolin's ulcer is defined as the appearance of a neoplasm within a chronic wound. The most common histological type is squamous. A total of 2 cases treated in our hospital are presented. CLINICAL CASE Case 1. A 71 year old man who presented with redness and suppuration from the wounds he had in his right foot after an electric shock 40 years earlier. The radiology showed involvement of the 4° and 5° metatarsal. Supracondylar amputation was performed, showing a well-differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma. CASE 2 A 56 year old male, paraplegic for 20 years. He was treated due to an infected right heel ulcer, with partial improvement, but the ulcers persisted. Biopsy was performed, reporting as epidermoid carcinoma. Infracondylar amputation was performed. The diagnosis was a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating the dermis. CONCLUSION The prevalence of Marjolin's ulcer is 1.3-2.2% of all ulcers. Diagnosis is difficult, so biopsy is recommended on any suspicious lesion or ulcer that has received conservative treatment for one month without improvement, although this time limit is not clear. The treatment is the surgery. Local excision with a margin of an inch is enough. If the ulcer is extensive, amputation is required. Survival is estimated between 66 and 80% at 2 years, with recurrence rates of 23%. Unfavourable factors are poor tumour differentiation and metástasis, appearing in 20% of cases.</dc:description>
