<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Recurrencies of lymphatic metastasis implies a poor prognosis in patients with head and neck carcinoma. The aim of our study is to analyse the results of salvage treatment after an isolated regional tumour recurrence. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective study of 144 patients with head and neck carcinoma with an isolated neck recurrence. The treatments used, regional control and patient's survival were analysed. RESULTS Sixty-four percent (92/144) of patients were not candidates to salvage treatment with radical intention. Salvage surgery was performed in 36% (52/144) of patients, with a survival of 46% in this group of patients. Previous treatment of the neck was the most relevant variable to decide a salvage surgery. Patients treated initially with neck dissection had the worst prognosis. CONCLUSIONS The existence of a regional recurrence has a bad prognosis, with 16% 5-year survival. Only 36% of patients were considered candidates to salvage treatment, achieving 46% of survival.</dc:description>
