<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To assess the clinical validity of two new recently described parameters (spinal-sacral angle (SSA) and spinal inclination angle (SIA) in adult scoliosis (AS) for evaluating the spinal-pelvic sagittal profile, as well as their still undefined role in AS. MATERIAL AND METHOD A non-concurrent prospective radiographic and clinical study was conducted on 59 primary surgeries of AS (Cobb&gt;40°), with a minimum of 2 years follow-up. The available X-rays and health questionnaires of 49 patients were used in the study. The changes in X-ray parameters after surgery were evaluated (Wilcoxon test), as well as the correlations as regards the clinical-radiography-age parameters (Spearman test and multiple linear regression). RESULTS The median post-surgical follow-up was 8.5 years, and the median age of the patients was 49.5 years. There was a statistically significant change with the surgery in the SSA and SIA (less than 5° in both), thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic rotation, sagittal balance (SB) and frontal Cobb. There was no correlation between pain and SSA-ST. There was a significant relationship between activity and SSA, ST, LL, SB, and age. After the multivariate analysis only age (not SSA or SIA) remained as a possible predictor of lower activity. DISCUSSION When frontal deformity predominates, the sagittal radiographic parameters, including the newest angles, although they have an influence patient activity when analysed individually, they lose this influence when they are analysed together and with other clinical parameters. CONCLUSIONS The SSA and SIA hardly change with surgery. They only correlate with activity, but cannot be considered predictors of this. Thus they do seem to be useful measurements in AS.</dc:description>
