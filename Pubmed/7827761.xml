<dc:description xml:lang="en">We evaluated the efficacy of phenolated glutaraldehyde in a 1:8 solution for the disinfection of bronchofibroscopes that were highly contaminated with Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An Olympus BF-P10 bronchofibroscope was contaminated with artificial samples containing one of the aforementioned microorganisms in concentrations nearing 10(8) colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml). The instruments were then washed with soap and water and submerged in a 1:8 solution of phenolated glutaraldehyde. Samples were taken for culturing after contamination, after washing, and after 10, 15 and 30 min in the disinfectant solution. The level of cfu/ml in the cultures was measured and the definition of failure-to-disinfect was a finding of &gt; or = 1 cfu/ml after each experimental procedure. Twenty procedures, 10 for each microorganism, were carried out. Washing of the bronchofibroscope afforded significant elimination of microorganisms and no colony growth was observed in cultures after 10 min submersion in phenolated glutaraldehyde. We conclude that immersion in a 1:8 solution of phenolated glutaraldehyde after careful washing is a valid way to disinfect bronchofibroscopes that are highly contaminated with S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.</dc:description>
