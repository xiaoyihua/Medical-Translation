<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Although age to conceive has been delayed in both males and females, male age is controversial as decisive for this purpose. OBJECTIVE To describe the results of intrauterine insemination pregnancy according to the age of the man. To determine whether this variable modifies semen parameters. To analyze whether pregnancy outcomes are modified by sperm morphology. PATIENTS AND METHODS A descriptive, retrospective, longitudinal and analytical study. We analyzed 2,276 intrauterine insemination cycles performed in the Mexican Center for Fertility CEPAM from January 2000 to December 2012. We included only women under 35 years old without tubal occlusion. Semen parameters were evaluated after capacitation and the pregnancy rate by male age group and sperm morphology was analyzed. The results were analyzed with SPSS 20. Continuous variables were reported as means and their standard deviations and logistic regression univariate to determine the statistical significance. The categorical variables were evaluated in frequencies and percentages. RESULTS 2,276 intrauterine insemination cycles were pooled according to the age of the male. The lower pregnancy rate was found in the group of men over 50 years. There was negative correlation between the increasing age with the total motile cell volume and morphology. There was only one pregnancy from a male over 50 years. When morphology was less than 4%, the pregnancy rate was significantly lower after 45 years; if it was more than 4% this effect was not observed. CONCLUSION Male age affects pregnancy outcomes in intrauterine insemination cycles, as long as the sperm morphology is altered.</dc:description>
