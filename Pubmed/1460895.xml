<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In the present study the year experience of a multidisciplinary team (oncologic, unit for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and surgery) with the use of a new method of central intravenous administration of medication such as that of subcutaneous venous reservoirs (SVR) is reviewed. METHODS The subcutaneous injection capsules were implanted as a venous access in 150 surgical procedures in 146 patients from October 1985 to April 1991 with a total follow up of 29.190 days and a mean length of 251 days for SVR. Sixty-two percent (94 implantations) of the SVR were implanted in the out patient clinic, 20% (30 patients) were admitted for placement of the reservoir although this was only indicated in the first two years of the series, 13% (20 patients) during hospitalization for the base disease and only 4% (6 patients) were specifically admitted for surgical preparation (plasma, platelets, and others). SVR were used for chemotherapy (124 cases, 82%), repeated transfusions (6 cases, 4%) and chronic medication (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, infections) (30 patients, 20%). Forty-two percent permitted chemotherapy administration by continual transfusion on an out patient regime. RESULTS A series of mechanical complications (3 cases, 2%), septic (9 episodes in 7 patients, 5%) and thrombotic (8 of the catheter) (5%) and 4 of the central veins (2%) were observed. In the present series the rate of infections (5%) (0.072 episodes of bacteremia per 100 days/patient) and thrombosis (3%) was very low due to a strict protocol of maintenance and control by the medical team and hospital staff. The need for radiologic control during surgery is emphasized although, as demonstrated in the present review, the technique of localization by a cath-finder (external detector) permits greater speed with the same security. CONCLUSIONS The degree of patient satisfaction and the minimum incidence of serious complications in determined risk groups (neutropenia, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) demonstrates that subcutaneous venous reservoirs (SVR) constitute an excellent method as a chronic venous access. The SVR present a lower rate of complications if compared with any historic series of external vascular catheterization.</dc:description>
