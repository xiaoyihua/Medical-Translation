<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present the case of a 17-year-old male whose diagnosis is Parsonage-Turner syndrome relapsing in the right arm. In his medical record, he was diagnosed as having amyotrophic neuralgia of the upper limb in three previous occasions. The diagnosis was similar in all episodes, although the affected upper limb was alternating. He was treated in the Rehabilitation Services of two hospitals. At physical examination, in every relapse, he showed acute pain in both, shoulder and arm, and loss of strength in the shoulder blade and the affected upper limb. The aim of his treatment combines the healing of the pain and, together with physiotherapy, fighting against muscular atrophy. The patient evolved favourably in each of the episodes. Nowadays, he does not show any symptom, and he has been discharged from the rehabilitation service.</dc:description>
