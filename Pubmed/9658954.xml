<dc:description xml:lang="en">Infectious endocarditis is increasingly resistant to antibiotic therapy, due to the increasing number of patient with cardiovascular prostheses or those who are severely immunosuppressed. Frequently, this syndrome and its complications can only be solved with surgery. In this article, which is based on the international literature plus own observations in 77 patients, the indications for surgery and the different technical approaches during the acute phase of infectious endocarditis are reviewed. Surgery to control infectious endocarditis is indicated when there is one of the following situations: a) persistence of infection despite an adequate antibiotic treatment, usually due to a specific pathogen (Staphylococcus aureus, fungus, etc.) or to a low antibiotic penetration into the infected issues (abscess); b) progressive hemodynamic deterioration due to tissular destruction and development of valvular incompetence or fistulous communications or c) development of other complications (repetitive embolism, cardiovascular aneurysms, conduction blocks, etc.). Hemodynamic deterioration due to heart failure refractory to medical treatment is the most frequent indication for cardiovascular surgery, and this was present in 61% of our patients. The timing for surgery is still controversial, although scheduling it at an early stage is generally preferred. The specific surgical technique is chosen according to the degree of tissular destruction and is aimed to remove the infected tissue and to repair the damaged structures or, if this is not feasible, to implant cardiovascular prosthesis.</dc:description>
