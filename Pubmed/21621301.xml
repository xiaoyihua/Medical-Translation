<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) with hexaminolevulinate has been recently used to improve detection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Our main purpose was to quantify the benefit of PDD vs. conventional white light cystoscopy (WL) in our area. MATERIAL AND METHODS Fluorescence-guided cystoscopy using hexaminolevulinate was performed at the time of the transurethral resection (TUR) in 305 patients from 7 Spanish hospitals. All lesions found with WL and PDD were numbered and recorded in an online database. Each lesion was sent separately for pathology analysis. Random biopsies were also obtained in 148 patients. RESULTS A total of 1659 lesions were biopsied: 522 were identified with PDD and WL, 237 only with PDD, 19 only with WL and 881 random biopsies. Of the 600 tumors, PDD detected 563, WL 441 and random biopsies 29 (20 CIS). The mean overdetection rate for PDD over WL was 31.9% for all types of lesions, but it was 209% for carcinoma in situ (CIS). Sensitivity was 93.8% for PDD and 78.2% for WL. Specificity was 81.5% for PDD and 90.5% for WL. In 23% of patients, PDD detected at least one additional neoplastic lesion compared to WL. CONCLUSIONS Hexaminolevulinate fluorescence cystoscopy improves detection and resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, especially of CIS. Sensitivity of PDD is higher than WL, but specificity is lower. In our study, random biopsies were able to detect some CIS not visible under PDD.</dc:description>
