<dc:description xml:lang="en">Acquired hemophilia A is a truly exceptional hemorrhagic diathesis, that consists of the emergence of polyclonal autoantibodies (inhibitor) IgG-type (subclasses 1 and 4, in most cases) against the coagulant function of the circulating factor VIII, which acts in the domains C2, A2 and A3 of the molecule, thus interfering their interaction with the factor IXa, the phospholipids and the Von Willebrand factor. Its morbidity and mortality are high, but nevertheless its low incidence (1-1.5 cases per million population per year) is the most frequent autoimmune disorder. This paper reports the clinical case of two patients; the first one, 36 years old, who the tenth day of postpartum required re-entry due to a diagnosis of hematoma of the abdominal wall that was surgically drained twice. The patient of case 2 was 39 years old and at six days of postpartum went to the emergency room due to bleeding, she was underwent to curettage and therapeutic transfusion of 3 UCH. Because of the persistence of bleeding, which was not possible to control with medical treatment and conservative measures, therapeutic hysterectomy was performed, with blood transfusion later. Due to the hemorrhagic complications of this condition and the serious clinical consequences derived from them, it is important to establish an early diagnosis; it is therefore critical to know the existence of this very rare disease to be able to avoid its consequences.</dc:description>
