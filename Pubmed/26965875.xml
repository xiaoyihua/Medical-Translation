<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Vaccination, a health action that has allowed to decrease mortality and to eradicate many diseases, may be at risk as a result of misinformation of parents and campaigns led by movements against vaccines. OBJECTIVE To describe and analyze the knowledge and attitudes of parents of newborns and children of 2 and more months of age against the application of vaccines. METHOD Exploratory study performed by application of a questionnaire to parents attending the UC CHRISTUS health network. RESULTS Knowledge and attitude of parents of newborns is rated as very good. 32.5% think that the vaccines can cause damage or claim not to know and have wrong knowledge; vaccination is considered a measure in favor of their childrens' health, but manifest that scarce information does not allow to make right decisions and suspect economic interests behind them. The parents of older children have no precise knowledge of the existing calendar, nor of the name of vaccines. They think that the existing information does not allow them to be sure of the real benefits, with some of them even feeling forced to vaccinate their children. DISCUSSION It is urgent to educate and answer questions about the importance and safety of vaccines and to perform studies at a national level.</dc:description>
