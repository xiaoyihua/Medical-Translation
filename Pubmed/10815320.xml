<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To determine whether granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used in addition to antibiotic therapy, in patients with chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia shortens the period of fever, neutropenia and hospitalization. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study was prospective. Patients with lymphoblastic acute leukemia (LAL) were included. They received intensive chemotherapy of induction, intensification, or consolidation. At random, a group received amikacin-ceftriaxone; if no had response after 3 days, we added vancomicin and, after 7 days, amphotericin. The other group received in addition these antibiotics, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. RESULTS The groups were comparable in the magnitude of the initial neutropenia (&lt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L), site of the infection, chemotherapy received germs isolated, age, and sex. The patients of the group that received FEC-G were cured in the course of 3.1 days; in the group without FEC-G, this occurred in 7.2 days (p = 0.0001). At the end of the infectious episode, the number of neutrophils, in the group with FEC-G, was of 1.9 x 10(9)/L versus 0.7 x 10(9)/L (p = 0.0009). The mortality was of one and two cases (p = 0.46). The global mortality was 7.5%. CONCLUSIONS The addition of FEC-G to the treatment with antibiotics, in febrile neutropenia, decreases duration of days with fever, hospitalization and neutropenia. However, the frequency of cure is not augmented.</dc:description>
