<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential in the development and regulation of the immune response (IR). The inherent potential of DCs to induce a specific immune response in the neonatal period is controversial. It has been suggested that the specific IR in neonates depends on the quantitative relation of DC/T lymphocytes, as well as on the neonatal or adult age at which the interaction antigen/DC/T lymphocytes occurs. This suggests that this contact has an influence on the phenotypic and/or biological properties of DCs, which modifies its behavior. Therefore, the effects of Leishmania mexicana (L. mexicana) and of TNFalpha and RANTES cytokines on immunophenotypical characteristics were evaluated on spleen DCs, from neonate and adult BALB/c mice, by using flow cytometry and in vitro migratory properties with a Boyden Chamber. In basal conditions, neonate and adult DCs express the same molecules (CD40, CD86, MHCII and CD54). When the DCs interact with the antigen L. mexicana, the expression of these molecules are similar in adults and in neonates, with the exception of CD40 whose intensity of expression was raised (P &lt; 0.05) in both groups. The rate of migration of the DCs in a culture medium conditioned of L. mexicana, RANTES and TNFalpha was higher in adults than in newborn mice. These observations suggest that neonatal and adult mice DCs have similar phenotypic characteristics. Under the effect of the same stimulus they respond differently; suggesting that other factors are involved in the higher susceptibility that newborns have to infections.</dc:description>
