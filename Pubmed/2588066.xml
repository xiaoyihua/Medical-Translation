<dc:description xml:lang="en">In spite of the widespread use of oral poliovirus vaccine, some countries have not achieved an optimal control of poliomyelitis. According to Sabin, this fact is due to a lack of immunization coverage of children under one year of age. In this study, the relationship between the general morbidity rate for polio and vaccination coverage of children under one year of age, in people protected by the Mexican Institute of Social Security, is analyzed. There is a negative correlation between these two variables: the lesser the coverage, the greater the rates. There is also a correlation between the rate of polio and the rate of polio for the year prior to each of the years of the study period. In a multiple regression model, both the coverage and the rate for the previous year were significantly correlated with the rate of polio. In order to get an optimum control of this disease, it is advantageous to consider that it is not enough to increase the coverage but that this coverage must be opportune, i.e., in the first year of life.</dc:description>
