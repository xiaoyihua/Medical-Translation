<dc:description xml:lang="en">The developing certain cancerous disease, affecting more and more people at younger ages, in many cases coincide with their working age. Through research and development of new therapies, there has been an increase in the number of people who manage to beat the disease and achieve a return above their working lives, giving thanks to this effort, a great help and motivation. A number of questionnaires consolidated and experienced to assess the quality of life of the population, but few studies have been reported on what type of survey would be most appropriate for use in the workplace to older workers who manage to overcome the cancer and rebuild their lives. This article aims to clarify which are the most widely used health questionnaires and proposing what would be most suitable to apply to these cases prevention services.</dc:description>
