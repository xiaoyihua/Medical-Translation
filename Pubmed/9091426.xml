In México we now count with one of the best and most advanced contraceptive methods levonorgestrel implants. Even though it is far from being the ideal anticonceptive. It is in advantage over those known today in this country, because it does not content estrogens, it lasts up to 5 years, its reversible and it can be easily installed in a doctor's office. Some mexican doctors do not recognize yet this product or have been the victims of bad taste advertising. Learning about the method, its indications, contraindications, side effects, correct application and removal technics you can easily end the wrong ideas of it as a problematic device. The objective of the present work is to inform to the medical field of an excellent birth control alternative.</dc:description>
