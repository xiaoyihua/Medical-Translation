<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Cysticercosis is a common parasitic infection caused by the larval phase of the Taenia solium, it infects humans as well as pigs. Considered an endemic parasitosis in developing countries including Latin America, Asia and Africa. Clinical manifestations of the disease can be influenced by ambient factors, host individualities and the infectious agent itself. Neurocysticercosis can be asymptomatic or present with various signs and symptoms that can vary in severity. OUTLINE This review is focused on analyzing the various presentations of Neurocysticercosis throughout different age groups, and special populations. We found asymptomatic presentations to be the most common form, followed by various grades of severity including in its most severe form death. The most common alterations include: epilepsy (60-90%), intracraneal hypertension (14-27%), as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms (5-52%), and focal neurological deficits (4-19%). The heterogeneity of the clinical scenario relies upon parasite factors (number, localization and stage of central nervous system [CNS] disease), host particularities (gender, age and immunologic response), and finally environmental factors. CONCLUSIONS The most common form of infection is asymptomatic although there are various forms of clinical manifestations that rely upon different factors including environment, host response and the parasite itself.</dc:description>
