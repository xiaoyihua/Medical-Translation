<dc:description xml:lang="en">A study was conducted on a group of 30 patients with mormal nutritional conditions who required parenteral alimentation. Three groups were selected at random. They received glucose as a calorie source and nitrogen from amino acids derived from hidrolizate of natural protein. Group I received 40 Kcal/kg/day and 250 mg of nitrogen/day. Group II 30 Kcal/kg/day and 175 mg nitrogen/kg/24 hours. And group III received 20 Kcal/kg/day and 100 mg of nitrogen/kg/24 hours. The first two groups had a positive nitrogen balance and the third group had negative balance. The positive nitrogen balance of group I, was only 670 mg better than the obtained for group II. Group I received 4 gr more of nitrogen than group II. This study show that the scheme of calories and nitrogen administered to the group II was the best for the maintenance of the nutritional conditions in the patients studied.</dc:description>
