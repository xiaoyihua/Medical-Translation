<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The treatment of type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) requires changes in patients' eating habits and lifestyles which could lead to the development of an eating disorder (ED). An early detection of these disorders in subjects with T1DM is necessary. However, there is no specific questionnaire concerning the presence of an ED in these patients. OBJECTIVES To translate and validate for the Spanish population a specific questionnaire aimed at detecting the risk of onset of an ED on a sample of subjects with T1DM. To analyze its agreement with its shortened version and with the gold standard tool, EAT-26. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cross-sectional study. The study population consisted of 112 adults with T1DM. The EAT-26 tool and DEPS-R questionnaire were used to detect subjects at risk for developing ED. In addition, several characteristics such as weight, height, BMI, age and age of onset were assessed by means of self-administered questionnaires, in order to study their correlation with test scoring. RESULTS Structural properties of the tests were evaluated through methodological procedures aimed at calculating reliability and validity. The translated and adapted version had a high consistency in both its complete and summarized version (α=0,821).The test-retest also yielded consistent results (intraclass correlation coefficient 95.8% for EPAD and 92.3% for EPAD-R). The factor analysis yielded 5 factors: 1) Eating attitudes; 2) Bulimic behavior; 3) Weight control; 4) Avoidance, and 5) Restriction. CONCLUSIONS We have developed a questionnaire in Spanish capable of identifying the risk of onset of a specific ED in patients with T1DM. The EPAD-R questionnaire detected 10% more cases and different ones than those detected by the EAT-26 test. It is necessary to use specific screening tools to correctly identify eating disorders in patients with T1DM.</dc:description>
