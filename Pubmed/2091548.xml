<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED We analyzed retrospectively 130 patients treated with amiodarone. They were seen at the Arrhythmias Clinic of this Institute from march 1981 until may 1988 with the purpose of evaluate the frequency of the side effects of the drug. The group of patients consisted of 67 men and 63 women, the mean age was 32 years and they were followed for about 32 months. The average dose of the drug was 1.069 gr per week. All of them had a physical and radiological examination, an ECG and laboratory tests. Besides, 86 patients went through an electrophysiological study at least once. One hundred and eighteen patients had periodical tests for thyroid function. All of the patients had a check up every 3 or 6 months. RESULTS the response to the drug was good or even excellent in 83% of patients. They did not show electrocardiographic changes of statistic significance (duration of the PR, QRS or QT). The ophthalmologic examination showed corneal deposits in 48% of patients, but in no case there was indication to stop the treatment. Ten patients had a spontaneous regression of these deposits. Alterations of the thyroid function were seen in 33.8% of patients, 14 had hypothyroidism and seven hyperthyroidism, the others simple goitre. In four of these cases the drug was discontinued. Dermatologic lesions were seen in only 4% of patients. Despite the high frequency of side effects the need for stopping the treatment was low, with a high percentage of drug efficacy.</dc:description>
