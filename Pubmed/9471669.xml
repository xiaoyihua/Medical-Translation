<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of maintenance treatment with ranitidine to prevent recurrence of duodenal ulcer disease. BACKGROUND Duodenal ulcer disease after complete healing by acid-suppression therapy, but without maintenance, recurs in about 50 to 90 percent of patients within 12 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty patients with healed duodenal ulcer confirmed by endoscopy were double blind randomized for maintenance treatment with ranitidine, 150 mg, or placebo at bed time for 12 months. Each patient gave informed consent and the trial was approved by the regional ethics committee. Patients were monitored every month and examined by endoscopy at the 6th and 12th month follow-up, or more often if major ulcer-like symptoms occurred. Comparisons were performed using chi-square test. RESULTS The relapse rates in the ranitidine group were 30.4 percent while in the placebo group were 63.6 percent (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS These differences were highly significant hence it might be expected that ranitidine given nightly at mentioned dosis is safe and reduces the risk of recurrence of duodenal ulcer.</dc:description>
