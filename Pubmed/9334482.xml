<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The predisposing environmental factors and clinical picture of lead poisoning, are not well known. AIM To describe the clinical picture, diagnosis and treatment of lead poisoning in individuals under industry exposure. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Twenty of 38 workers of a printing press were studied. Their medical and labor histories were recorded. Lead in air in the working area and the dose received by the workers was measured. RESULTS The environmental lead in the linotype room was 25% over the accepted values. Twelve of the 20 workers were poisoned and three were highly exposed. Poisoned workers were working in areas with high environmental lead concentrations, were in direct contact with the metal, had plasma lead concentrations over 70 micrograms/dl and an average exposure time of over 17 years. Their clinical picture was not specific and related to plasma and environmental lead concentrations, length of exposure and type of contact. CONCLUSIONS Lead poisoning must be suspected among workers exposed to high environmental concentrations and its treatment consists in withdrawing poisoned subjects from polluted areas.</dc:description>
