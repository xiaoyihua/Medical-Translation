<dc:description xml:lang="en">An appropriate health technology to facilitate child growth and development in a rural area is presented and documented. Because mother's adequate behavior related to child's care does not produce immediate behavioral or physical changes it is necessary to create a long term social system of consequences. This was achieved joining a longitudinal measurement system with a program to train mothers to identify and deal with health and development issues. During four years, data were collected on weight-length development and morbidity twice a year and simultaneously skills were taught to diagnose treatment and prevent growth and development problems. After the third session child development and anthropometry data became the base of a system to assess maternal behavior, providing consequences for links in the behavior chains associated with child care. This system made organization and participation of the community in primary health care programs more likely, which implied a better score in each child growth and development chart.</dc:description>
