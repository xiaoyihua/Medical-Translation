<dc:description xml:lang="en">Leguminous are a cheap source of protein that are cultivated practically throughout the world. They are the main source of food in developing countries. In the Mediterranean area and Middle East, the most commonly consumed legumes are lentils and chickpea. In the United States, United Kingdom and south-east Asia, the major legumes involved in food allergy are considered to be peanut and soy bean, respectively. The clinical manifestations of the allergy to legumes are similar for all legumes and range from oral allergy syndrome, urticaria, angioedema, rhinitis and asthmatic crises to anaphylaxis and even death. Legumes have a high degree of immunological cross-reactivity. Severals authors have described cross-reactivity among different legumes and between legumes and various vegetables. The allergenicity of legumes is mainly is mainly related to allergens from the storage proteins of seeds. Vicilins from this group of proteins could be an important common allergen in clinical allergy to legumes. Profilins are considered to be a cause of cross-reactivity among fruits, vegetables and some pollens and are believed to be a panallergen. Other panallergens of increasing importance are lipid transfer proteins. Few studies have assessed the long-term clinical course of allergy to legumes. Novel therapeutic agents are being investigated for the treatment of peanut allergy and these could be applied to other legumes.</dc:description>
