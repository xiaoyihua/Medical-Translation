<dc:description xml:lang="en">Special circumstances: Mountains called "Los Andes", the Humbolt maritime current, subtropical region; which makes the peruvian territory present the ecosystem which influence the fauna, flora, and pothology. Contain diseases like parasite dermatosis (mal de Pinto, verruga peruana, leishmaniasis, blastomycosis and pain) have close relation with the different ecosystem of the peruvian territory. This study only includes these dermatosis and are resumed as follows: The disease called, mal del Pinto is only diffused in the arid coast, andean valleys and the virgin forest (it is found in altitudes of 800 to 1,000 m.). The verruga peruvian: Is found in the occidental part of the andean valleys (at 800 and 1,000 m. of altitude). Leishmaniasis exist in two forms: One like bottom of orient with only skin alteration called leishmaniasis andina (uta for the indians), its propagated in the coast and the andean valleys at 200 m. (amount 1,200 to 3,000); the otter form affects the mycosis, called leishmaniasis americana (espundia for the indians), its it propagates general in the virgin forest. The brazilian blastomycosis only exists in the virgin forest. The pain, disease does not exist in the arid coast, nor in the andean valleys. Geographically, for its propagation it is necessary heat, humidity and heavy rainy water, that is why it is only found in the virgin forest.</dc:description>
