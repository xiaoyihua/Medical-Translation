<dc:description xml:lang="en">The increase in the detection of occult lesions has led to the development of new localisation methods using radiopharmaceutical products. The use of these products allows us to perform a "thrifty" (less-aggressive) surgical excision and, to simultaneously carry out the biopsy of the sentinel node in cases of breast cancer. On making a search for the most up to date references on this particular topic, we found many articles on radioguided surgery by many leading international work groups. These articles clearly show the advantages of the radioguided surgery method, its effectiveness and attractiveness to surgeons who are very much involved in the search for excellence in their daily work. We also contribute our experience as a functional group, with 413 interventions on occult lesions performed using the radioguided method (ROLL). In 229 cases out of these 413, we found a malignancy (75%); in all these 229 cases it was possible to perform the intervention simultaneously with the biopsy of the sentinel node (SNOLL), during the same surgical act. However the interest created by the new procedure, it is essential to keep a critical but innovative and reflexive mind on this issue, in order to accurately analyze the results obtained by each group. We must remember that these types of methods involve several clinical specialties and, therefore, each one will have to contribute with the highest efficiency.</dc:description>
