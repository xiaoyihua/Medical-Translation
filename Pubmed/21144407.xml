<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES This article describes the findings of the 2009 Spanish Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) Registry compiled by the Working Group on Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators of the Spanish Society of Cardiology's Electrophysiology and Arrhythmias Section. METHODS Each implantation team voluntarily sent prospective data recorded on a single-page document to the Spanish Society of Cardiology. RESULTS In total, 4108 device implantations were reported, which comprised 88.6% of the estimated total number of implantations carried out. The number of implants reported corresponded to 89 per million population and the estimated total number was 100.2 per million. The proportion of first implantations among those reported was 71.3%. Data were received from 134 centers, 17 more than in 2008. There continued to be significant regional variations between the various Spanish autonomous regions. The highest implantation rate (81%) was in men (mean age 62 years) who had severe or moderate-to-severe ventricular dysfunction and were in New York Heart Association functional class II. The most common heart condition was ischemic heart disease, followed by dilated cardiomyopathy. Indications for primary prevention accounted for 55.9% of first implantations; this figure was lower than the previous year's for the first time since 2003. The most significant increase observed was in patients with ischemic heart disease. CONCLUSIONS The 2009 Spanish ICD registry included data on almost 89% of all ICD implantations performed in the country. Although the number of implantations has continued to increase, it still remains far from the European average. The percentage of implantations performed for primary prevention was observed to have stabilized.</dc:description>
