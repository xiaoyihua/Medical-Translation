<dc:description xml:lang="en">During a period of 3 years 14 patients with AIDS and CNS focal lesions documented by CT scan were evaluated. All patients received empirical treatment against Toxoplasma. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of the different etiologies of the neurologic lesions as well as to evaluate the usefulness of routine cerebral biopsy before establishing empiric antitoxoplasma treatment in a population of AIDS patients with a high incidence of drug addiction. Eleven patients developed histologic and clinical criteria of cerebral toxoplasmosis, one patient presented progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and in the remaining two patients the etiologic diagnosis could not be established. Only one patient presented multiple etiologic lesions and in no cases the presence of mycobacteria or fungi could be demonstrated in the cerebral tissue. The overall percentage of responses to the empiric antitoxoplasma treatment was 42%. This percentage increased to 54% if patients with coma were not included in the analysis. Cumulated mortality of the entire group was 78.5%. It is concluded: 1) the predominance of Toxoplasma gondii as a cause of cerebral lesions in our AIDS population; 2) the acceptable percentage of response to empiric antitoxoplasma treatment in non-comatose patients, and 3) the high overall mortality rate in these patients. It is therefore suggested that routine cerebral biopsies will not be justified as initial diagnostic approach in HIV positive patients with focal CNS lesions.</dc:description>
