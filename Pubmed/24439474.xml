<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Surgical treatment of gallbladder cancer is still controversial. The extent of the radical surgery and its therapeutic efficacy continue to be debated. OBJECTIVE Analyze the efficacy of radical resection in patients with incidental gallbladder cancer evaluating the presence of residual disease in the resection specimen and analyzing the associated factors of survival. METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients with incidental GC between June 1999 and June 2010 was performed. Incidental (I) tumors were included. Data covering demographic features, clinical characteristics, local pathological stage, histological features and factors for long term survival were analyzed. p&lt; 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS A total of 28 patients: 78,6% females. Median age 56 years. All treated by resection of segments 4b/5 and lymphadenectomy. Histological examination revealed residual disease in 42% (37% liver), residual disease was related to tumoral (T) stage (p 0,001). Patients with residual disease presented a DSS and DFS of 10 and 6.5 months respectively vs 56 months in those without residual disease (p 0,001). Variables associated with survival were T stage (P .006), TNM stage (P&lt;.001), and residual disease in the resected specimen (P&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS Aggressive re-resection of incidental GC offers the only chance for cure but its efficacy depends on the extent of the disease found at the time of repeated surgery and in the deferred pathological study.</dc:description>
