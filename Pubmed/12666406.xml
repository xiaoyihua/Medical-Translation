<dc:description xml:lang="en">Computarized tomography allows proper identification and evaluation of stage in the majority patients with periampullary tumors. However, 30% of peritoneal metastases cannot be seen in image studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasound in the staging process of pancreatic and ampullary tumor. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed on 20 patients included in the study Mean age was 58.35 +/- 13.4 years. Twelve were males and eight females. In two patients, laparoscopy showed peritoneal metastases and ultrasound did not show extrapancreatic involvement. In five patients, there was vascular invasion without metastases. In three patients, both peritoneal metastases and vascular invasion were found, and in five there was neither vascular invasion nor metastasis. Laparoscopic findings were confirmed in a but one patient. In 14 of the 16 patients In whom peritoneal lavage was performed, microscopic exam showed a sufficient number of cells to make a diagnosis. We concluded that laparoscopy with ultrasound is useful in staging of patients with duodeno-bilio-pancreatic malignancies.</dc:description>
