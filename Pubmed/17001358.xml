<dc:description xml:lang="en">Sporting competition in our society has become the spectacle that mobilises and brings together the greatest number of people throughout the world, with the corresponding cultural and economic influence that this implies. As a result, the desire for athletic prowess has led sportspersons to undergo intense training programs and to consume substances that improve their performance, at times having recourse to doping techniques. At present, doping is the result of a combination of social, individual, physiological and cultural factors, which affect not only professional, but also amateur sportspeople. In order for the control and eradication of doping to be efficient, it is necessary to understand the problem and the substances that are most employed, amongst which special mention is merited by hormonal substances due to the complexity of detecting them and their possible repercussions on health.</dc:description>
