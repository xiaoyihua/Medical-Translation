<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Physicians in training face high-risk clinical situations for needlestick injuries during their training. OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence and establish behaviors associated with needlestick injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted during the 2012-2013 school year among undergraduate and graduate medical students of a Faculty of Medicine in Mexico. RESULTS There were a total of 441 questionnaires completed, of which 56.7% of students reported having experienced at least one lesion, of which only 44.5% reported it. The conditions and unsafe acts associated were: female students had a greater risk for the first puncture, whereas male students correlated with three or more punctures; third year students, night shift rounds, the feeling of being rushed by someone else, and the presence of fatigue were risk factors for the first puncture (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The high prevalence and the underreporting of non-intentional punctures places students at a higher risk of transmissible diseases. Strategies focused on prevention, monitoring, and control of accidental punctures should be implemented by hospitals, schools, and medical schools.</dc:description>
