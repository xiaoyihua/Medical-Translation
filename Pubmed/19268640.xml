<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Handgrip strength is an important test to evaluate physical fitness and nutritional status. The main objective of this research is to prepare a reference standard applicable to the Spanish population of both sexes between 6 and 18 years old. At the same time, to extend our knowledge of normal variation of this characteristic with age, gender, size and body composition. MATERIALS AND METHODS The sample consisted of 2125 subjects between the 6 and 18 years (1176 boys and 949 girls). The handgrip strength of both hands was taken with a digital adjustable dynamometer. Weight, height, forearm circumference and skin fold thickness were measured mass index, fat free. Body mass, percentage of fat and total, muscle and fat forearm areas were estimated. Ontogenetic and sexual variability of dynamometric force was analysed and a table was produced with the mean, standard deviation and percentile distribution, by hand, age and gender. Multiple correlation analysis was applied to establish the relationship between handgrip dynamometric force, body mass index and body composition variables. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Handgrip strength increases with age and a significant sexual dimorphism from the age of 12 years is observed. Growth charts with normal values obtained in healthy Spanish children and teenagers could be used as a reference pattern. The correlation between hand static force and fat free mass or arm muscle area is stronger than with direct size variables or body mass index.</dc:description>
