<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE We present the case of a big retroperitoneal tumor that received the pathologic diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. We also review the diagnostic and therapeutic features of this disease in the current literature. METHODS We present the case of a 75-year-old male who was admitted to the Gastrointestinal Disease Department with asthenia of several months of evolution and gastrointestinal problems. Abdominopelvic CT scan revealed a big mass of 20 x 22 x 12 cm, which seems to depend from the left kidney, together with an 8 cm diameter abdominal aortic aneurysm. RESULTS The patient underwent surgery and left radical nephrectomy together with radical resection of the retroperitoneal mass were performed. Pathology reportes malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the storiform-pleomorphic type, with hyaline degeneration foci (stadium pT2B). CONCLUSIONS Sarcomas are rare neoplasias. They can adopt several different morphologic patterns, as well as many differentiation degrees. The surgical treatment is still the only therapy with healing possibilities. Adjuvant treatments through radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are brought into question.</dc:description>
