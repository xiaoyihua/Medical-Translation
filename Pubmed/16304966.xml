<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To establish if there are differences on obstetric and perinatal outcomes between adolescents who are younger than 16 with young adults aging 20 to 24 years old. PATIENTS AND METHOD A double-cohort prospective and comparative study in 328 Mexican pregnant women. Cohort I included 153 pregnant adolescents younger than 16 years old and cohort II included 175 young adults aging 20 to 24 years old. Inclusion criteria for both groups were: healthy, singleton, primigravidas, with 4 or more antenatal care visits and delivery at institution. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS descriptive, t-test, chi-squared and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS Cohort I: Mean age, 15 years old. Mean gestational age on first visit, 22.35 +/- 6.75 weeks. Morbidity was due mainly by vaginitis and vaginosis (p = 0.0001), urinary tract infection (p = 0.110) and anemia (p = 0.0001). Maternal weight on first visit was 54.11 +/- 9.11 (p = 0.001). In cohort II mean maternal age was 22 years old with a mean gestational age on first visit of 19.58 +/- 7.94 weeks. Main morbidity was: urinary tract infections, vaginitis-vaginosis and preeclampsia (p = 0.191). Mean maternal weight on first visit was 60.37 +/- 9.99. Gestational age on delivery and birth weight were not statistically different between newborns in each group. CONCLUSIONS Pregnancy in adolescents should be considered of risk; nevertheless, adequacy in antenatal care provides good obstetric and perinatal outcomes.</dc:description>
