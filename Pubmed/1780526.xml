<dc:description xml:lang="en">We revised 6,863 protocols of clinical autopsies in four hospitals of the Andalusian Health Service, from 1973 to 1988, out of which 2,814 were valid, and finding 81 active tuberculosis cases (TBC) (2.87%), in 53 males and 28 females, with mean age of 54.41 years. Milliar forms (44 cases) predominated over non-milliar (37), with a premortem diagnosis in 32 cases. TBC was considered as the principal disease in 65.43%, it directed contributed to death in 59.26% of cases, and was associated to other diseases in 79.01% of cases. The most frequent localizations were lung (80.25%), lymph nodes (43.20%) and liver (37.04%). We compared two similar periods of time: 1978-80 and 1986-88, observing an increase in TBC in the latter, 14:22, which can be attributed to HIV infection, since 6 of the 22 cases were associated to this pathology.</dc:description>
