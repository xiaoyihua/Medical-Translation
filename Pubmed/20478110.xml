<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The most common features of the system for classifying ocular injuries of the eye in patients who require urgent retinal surgery were identified, and their predictive value was estimated in order to determine whether they are useful in detecting these patients. METHODS Patients with ocular trauma between 1998 and 2007 were retrospectively evaluated and assigned to one of two groups: group 1 (with injuries that required urgent retinal surgery) and group 2 (without those injuries). The rate and 95% confidence intervals (CI) that group 1 accounted for were identified. The rate of the most common features in group 1 was identified and compared with their rate in group 2 using chi(2) and odds ratio. Predictive values of those features for detecting group 1 were calculated. RESULTS Two hundred thirty eight eyes (mean age: 27.5 years) were included. Ten eyes were assigned to group 1 (4.2%, 95% CI 1.6-6.7) and 228 eyes were assigned to group 2. The most frequent features in group 1 were open globe (90%), type A open globe (50%), type C open globe (30%), grade 4 (70%) and zone III (70%). The positive predictive value was 60% for type C open globe, and &lt;50% for the remaining features. CONCLUSIONS Although some clinical features had a statistical and clinical association with the need for urgent retinal surgery, their predictive value was insufficient because the rate of eyes that required this intervention was low. The results suggest that open globe and visual loss should be used as referral criteria, regardless of the injuries found.</dc:description>
