<dc:description xml:lang="en">CLINICAL CASE The case concerns a 78 year-old woman with a history of XEN® surgery, in whom a conjunctival perforation was observed at the implant level at 18-months of follow-up, for which surgical intervention was decided. During surgery a short subconjunctival portion was found (0.5mm). An unsuccessful attempt was made to extract it by traction, but the XEN® broke easily. Finally, it was decided to cut it to scleral level, and suture the conjunctiva. During the first week there was a decrease in intraocular pressure (6mmHg), to subsequently increase to 25, and deciding to start medical treatment. DISCUSSION Conjunctival exposure of the XEN® stent is a rare but potentially serious complication. To avoid it, a meticulous surgical technique is important when implanting it. If this occurs, it is important to identify the cause. If it is due to a short subconjunctival portion, a therapeutic alternative is to cut the implant at this level to avoid further complications.</dc:description>
