<dc:description xml:lang="en">ADN content was measured using cytofluorometry in 31 infiltrative uterine cervical carcinomas, using 22 routine cytologic cervical spreads (18 from archives) and 9 cellular spreads obtained from the fresh surgical specimen. Results were correlated to the clinical staging and morphological parameters of the tumor. Eight samples (25.8%) were diploid and 23 (74.2%) aneuploid. Women with diploid tumors were not significantly older. No correlation was found between ADN content and clinical staging, degree of histological differentiation, degree of cervical wall infiltration or the presence of vascular tumor permeations. All the cytological spreads were adequate for the cytofluorometric study. It is concluded that a high percentage of cervical carcinomas are aneuploid and that the present technique can be applied successfully to cytological samples.</dc:description>
