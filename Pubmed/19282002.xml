<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To evaluate the risk factors of new fractures after vertebroplasty (VP). PATIENTS AND METHOD Prospective, non-randomized study including patients with acute osteoporotic fractures treated with VP. Baseline visit included clinical and densitometric data. At 30, 90 and 180 days, changes in clinical data and side effects (cement leakage and new fractures) were recorded. To establish the predictive factors of a new fracture, differences between the group of patients with new fractures (R1) and those without fractures (R0) were evaluated. RESULTS Vertebroplasty was performed in 43 patients (82 vertebrae). Cement leakage into a disc appeared in 11 cases (11,5%) and 12 new fractures occurred in 9 patients. No statistical differences were detected between groups R1 and R0 in the following variables: sex, age, vitamin D levels, T-score, kyphosis angle, primary/secondary osteoporosis, preexisting fractures, number of treated vertebrae and amount of cement injected. A positive, statistical significant correlation, was established between cement leakage into a disk and incidence of adjacent new fractures (p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS Cement leakage into a disc increases the risk of adjacent new fractures after vertebroplasty.</dc:description>
