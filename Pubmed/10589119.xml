<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To improve the results of corrective surgery for severe urinary incontinence in the female (sphincteric lesion) utilizing a new prosthesis that allows adjusting the degree of tension of the band or urethrocervical sling. METHODS We have added the use of a subcutaneous hydraulic device to the classical pubovaginal sling procedure. The device can be gradually filled by percutaneous punction to adjust the urethral closure pressure. RESULTS All patients had previously undergone different procedures and had grade III stress urinary incontinence. With the hydraulic device, the success rate (complete continence) was 95.5% (21/22 patients) and the complication rate was 9% (2 cases; one developed infection and the other chronic urinary retention). CONCLUSIONS The hydraulic device described herein is easy to place, low-cost and carries a minimum morbidity. Its use is indicated in patients who have previously undergone surgery, with a sphincteric lesion and who require precise adjustment of the urethrocervical sling. The degree of tautness can be adjusted repeatedly according to the clinical course of a patient without requiring reoperation.</dc:description>
