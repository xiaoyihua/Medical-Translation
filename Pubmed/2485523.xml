<dc:description xml:lang="en">Clinical and urodynamic findings in 50 children with normal neurologic examination and: enuresis (n = 5), vesical incontinence (n = 2), recurrent urinary tract infection (n = 10) or association of these abnormalities (n = 33) are described. Renal ultrasonography showed bilateral hydronephrosis in a girl with hypotonic bladder. Reflux nephropathy was detected in two children with vesical hyperactivity and in one patient with hypotonic bladder. Vesical residue was evident in 5 patients with hyperactive bladder. Increased bladder capacity occurred in two children with hypotonic response. Vesical neck formation was observed along micturition in 6 patients with hyperactive bladder. Hyperactive bladder response occurred in 5/5 patients with enuresis, in 1/2 children with vesical incontinence (VI), in 8/10 cases of recurrent urinary tract infection (RUTI) and in 23/33 patients with combined symptoms (CS). Hypertonic response was seen in 1/2 VI, 1/10 RUTI and 5/33 CS patients. Finally in 1/10 RUTI and in 5/33 CS cases bladders were hypotonic and 4/33 CS showed normal urodynamic findings.</dc:description>
