<dc:description xml:lang="en">Invasive fungal infection is the infectious complication with highest associated mortality. Until the 90's amphotericin B was the only drug available to treat these infections. Its spectrum of antifungal activity is excellent, but its use is associated with toxicity in many cases. The development of amphotericin B lipid formulations has resulted in a significant decrease in most of the side effects associated with this drug. Triazoles are safe and effective for treating most invasive fungal infections. Fluconazole is an excellent drug for the prevention and treatment of Candida and Cryptococcus infections, itraconazole has good activity against Candida and Aspergillus, and voriconazole has shown to be better than amphotericin B for invasive aspergillosis. Caspofungin belongs to a new group of antifungal agents, the echinocandins, which are very safe and present excellent activity against Candida and Aspergillus.</dc:description>
