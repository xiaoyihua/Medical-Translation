<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in an infant with urinary tract infection (UTI), does not necessarily lead to an acquired renal injury. Only serious reflux can be a factor in fostering its appearance. OBJECTIVES To assess whether in infants diagnosed for the first time with a UTI with a fever, a routine initial DMSA can be used as a screening method for detecting severe reflux and replace voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively studied 162 infants under 2 years old admitted to our hospital due to having a ITU with fever for the first time (92 males and 70 females). In all cases, a renal ultrasound, DMSA and VCUG had been performed a few days after the diagnosis. RESULTS Of the 162 patients, 62 (38 %) had VUR, of which 56 (90 %) were mild and 6 (10 %) were severe. The DMSA was abnormal in 26/100 patients without VUR (26 %), 12/56 with mild VUR (21 %) and 6/6 of those with severe VUR (100 %). DMSA sensitivity for detecting severe reflux was 100 % and specificity was 76 %. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value was 14 % and 100 % respectively. The positive likelihood ratio was 4.17 and the negative likelihood ratio was 0. CONCLUSIONS It is unnecessary to carry out VCUG in an infant with an initial UTI, and a negative DMSA.</dc:description>
