<dc:description xml:lang="en">Fetal death (FD) over 22 weeks are analyzed during a one year period in a service with approximately 12,000 deliveries per year. 118 FD were found and the study was completed in 97 pregnancies (100 FD). A control group was included. The pathologies more related with FD were the premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis and premature delivery. Followed by the funicular pathology, abruptio placentae, preeclampsia and intrahepatic cholestasia. Mother's educational level and prenatal care were clearly better in the control group. The majority of the FD occurred out of the hospital (70%). The anatomopathological study was performed in few cases (34%). We concluded that an important number of FD are preventable with an accurate prenatal care and that a complete and modern anatomopathological study including the placenta will decrease the high number (26%) of FD that remaining without diagnoses.</dc:description>
