<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is characterised by granulomatous vasculitis of the airway and glomerulonephritis. Since its first description, important advances have occurred in diagnosis and treatment; however, the aetiology remains unknown. Involvement of the head and neck region can often occur as the first and only manifestation. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of symptoms and signs in the region of the nose, ears and pharynx-larynx in a group of patients with WG. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated 17 patients with WG defined by clinical, laboratory and pathology criteria. Detailed histories were taken and an ENT physical examination, audiometry, tympanometry and nasofibrolaryngoscopy were performed in all patients. RESULTS The average age was 41.7 years and the average disease time was 9.12 years, ranging between 1 and 40. In these patients, 9 (53.1%) reported hearing loss and had altered audiometry, and 5 (55.6%) had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. In the nose, nasal obstruction in 11 (64.8%) and rhinorrhoea in 10 (58.8%) were the most prevalent; there was altered endoscopy in 12 (70.2%). In the pharynx-larynx, dyspnoea in 6 (35%) and hoarseness in 7 (41.2%) were the most prevalent and 7 (41%) had an altered laryngoscopy. CONCLUSION The otolaryngologist plays an essential role in diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of these patients. Knowing common symptoms makes diagnosis and treatment easier and earlier.</dc:description>
