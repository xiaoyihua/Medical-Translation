<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Polytrauma continues to be one of the main causes of death in the population between 10-40 years of age, and causes severe discapability in surviving patients. The aim of this study is to perform an analysis of the quality of care of the polytrauma patient using an epidemiological study. METHOD Prospective registry of all polytrauma patients treated at our hospital over 16 years of age, admitted to the critical care area or dead before admission. RESULTS From March 2006 to August 2014, we registered 1200 polytrauma patients. The majority were men (75%) with a median age of 45. The mean ISS was 20,9±15,8 and the most common mechanism of injury was blunt trauma (94% cases), The global mortality rate was 9.8% (117 cases), and neurological death was the most frequent cause (45.3%), followed by hypovolemic shock (29,1%). In 17 cases (14,5% of deaths) mortality was considered evitable or potentially evitable, A total of 327 patients (27.3%) needed emergency surgery and 106 patients (8,8%) needed emergency treatment using interventional radiology. 18,5% of patients (222) presented an inadverted injury, with a total of 318 inadverted injuries. CONCLUSION Trauma care at our centre is adequate. A prospective registry of the global care of polytrauma patients is necessary to evaluate the quality of care and improve results.</dc:description>
