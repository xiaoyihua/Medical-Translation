<dc:description xml:lang="en">Conidiobolomycosis is a subcutaneous mycosis of the facial midline affecting primarily adult males. It is caused by the saprophytic fungus, Conodiobolus coronatus, present in soils and dried vegetables, characteristic of intertropical regions. C. coronatus belongs to the class Zygomycetes, order Entomophthorales; it is a fungus composed of thick, short hyphae that grows at temperatures between 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C and causes nasal granulomas. The histologic findings are described of a case of conidiobolomycosis in a 31-year-old male, born and resident in the Urabá region of Colombia. He presented with a mid-facial deformity of the nose and upper lip edema, and polypoid images in the maxillary sinuses with destruction of the nasal septum. The biopsy revealed a diffuse inflammatory lesion located in the deep dermis and in the hypodermis corresponding to a necrotizing granuloma. Associated eosinophils and the presence of the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon were noted in the vacant central zone which apparently corresponded to location of the fungal hyphae. They did not stain with HE stain, but reacted to the PAS and Grocott staining techniques and appeared as rigid, thick-walled hyphae, centrally twisted and with cone-shaped endings.</dc:description>
