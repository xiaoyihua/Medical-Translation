<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Depression is a risk factor for developing secondary post-traumatic stress disorder. The earthquake on February 27th, 2010, destroyed the Hospital of Curicó. Despite the prevailing chaos, patients in treatment for severe depression actively maintained their treatment from the first post-earthquake working day AIM To determine prevalence of acute stress (AS) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after the earthquake among women in treatment for severe depression. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy five women aged 20 to 73 years in treatment for depression for at least six months before the oceurrence of the earthquake, who continued in follow up after the event, were studied. According to the Tenth International Classification of Diseases, the frequency of AS was assessed during the consultation oceurring one month after the event and the frequency of PTSD was assessed during the consultation oceurring six months after the event. RESULTS Fifty nine percent of women had AS symptoms at the first month and 53.3% had PTSD, six months later. AS was significantly associated with a low educational level. PTSD was significantly associated with prior oceurrence of AS and a history of childhood trauma history. CONCLUSIONS A high frequeney of PTSD was observed in this group of depressive patients, which was significantly associated with a history of previous AS and childhood trauma.</dc:description>
