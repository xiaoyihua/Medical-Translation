<dc:description xml:lang="en">Between may 1984 and november 1986, a study, which included 475 children under five years of age hospitalized due to acute intrathoracic respiratory infections, was carried out in order to obtain clinical, radiological and etiological characteristics which may aid in establishing norms to diagnose and treat these patients. Nasopharyngeal aspirations were performed on each child, while viral diagnosis was done through viral isolation techniques and indirect immunofluorescence. The presence of a virus was detected in 34.4% of the cases and in 28.8% of a subsample. A precoded questionnaire was used to obtain the clinical information needed and all X-rays were reviewed by the same radiologist using simple pre-established criteria. A comparison was made on the similarities found between both the clinical and radiological diagnosis, as well as the sensitivity and specificity of some of the clinical signs which characterize bronchiolitis and the pneumoniae.</dc:description>
