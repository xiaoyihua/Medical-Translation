<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND AIMS The Islamic precept of Ramadan (R), imposes on individuals who practice it important physiological and psychological changes due to water and dietary restrictions to which they are subjected during the day, over a month. This fact makes a singular constrat, particularly in multicultural Western societies, where there is no schedule adjustments in daily activities, which are common in predominantly Muslim countries. Among the changes, includes the activation of mechanisms of adaptation to the hydrosalin restriction, with consequences on the homeostasis of water and ion plasma. On the relevance of the issue and the limited knowledge of the effects of (R) on the ion balance, the aim of the present study is to analyze the behaviour of potassium ion for this month, in order to prevent some problems that may affect health. METHODOLOGY We have selected 10 young Muslim healthy men, aged between 18 and 25 years who perform Ramadan. Then we have analyzed biochemical parameters including ions, in blood and urine analysis, and also plasma levels of renin and aldosterone, one week before R, first and fourth week of R, and one week after the fasting. RESULTS During the month of R a decrease in potassium urine excretion by the morning is observed. The consequence of this fact is the increase of the levels in plasma concentration of potassium; throughout the afternoon, an increase in its excretion results more effective during the fourth week of R. DISCUSSION Changes in the availability of Na+, HCO3- and variability of pH, in the distal tubule, appear to be responsible for the potassium limited excretion observed during the fast of Ramadan. CONCLUSION These finding put into consideration the need of further studies focussing on potassium homeostasis during Ramadan in order to determine which factors are implicated in the raised levels of K+ observed in plasma.</dc:description>
