<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Although altered vascular permeability and edema of the bronchial mucosa are associated with asthma attack, their influence on its severity remains unknown. We address this issue by comparing relative indices for the concentration of albumin (RIAlb) and alpha2-macroglobulin (RIalpha2M) in induced sputum and peripheral blood from patients with exacerbated asthma, patients with stable asthma, and control subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty-six volunteers participated in the study: 14 with exacerbated asthma (forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1] 74.3% [SD, 20.8%] of reference), 23 with stable asthma (FEV1 93.6% [7.5%]), and 9 controls (FEV1 101.1% [9.9%]). The concentrations of albumin and alpha2-macroglobulin were quantified by immunoturbidimetry and immunonephelometry, respectively. The relative index was then calculated by dividing the concentration in sputum supernatant by the concentration in peripheral blood. RESULTS The mean RIAlb was 1.2 (1.1) in the control group, 2.9 (3.1) in the stable asthma group, and 6.0 (6.7) in the exacerbated asthma group. The RIalpha2M values were 11.7 (10.9), 11.9 (14.7), and 3.2 (3.8) for the control group and stable and exacerbated asthma groups, respectively. The increases in the RIAlb values between all groups, and the decrease in the RIalpha2M value between the exacerbated asthma and control groups were statistically significant (P&lt;.05). The percentage of neutrophils, but not of eosinophils, in sputum was correlated with the RIAlb (r=0.39; P=.008) but not the RIalpha2M (r=-0.035; P=.82). FEV1 displayed an inverse relationship with the RIAlb (r=-0.43; P=.009) but not with the RIalpha2M (r=-0.206; P=.24). No correlation was found between oxyhemoglobin saturation and either the RIAlb (r=-0.33; P=.19) or the RIalpha2M (r=-0.12; P=.84). CONCLUSIONS Vascular permeability is altered during asthma exacerbations and appears to be correlated with the presence of neutrophils and the degree of bronchial obstruction.</dc:description>
