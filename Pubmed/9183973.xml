<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To find out how experienced primary care physicians working in different societies see themselves as doctors. DESIGN A cross-sectional study. SETTING Primary health care in Estonia and Finland. PARTICIPANTS Estonian district doctors (n = 110) and Finnish specialists of general practice (n = 211). METHODS In a postal questionnaire the respondents were asked to evaluate how well 18 different expressions described them as doctors on a 5-step scale from "1 = very poorly" to "5 = very well". RESULTS Four of the five expressions that were thought most accurate and telling--"Listener", "Vocational doctor", "Helper", and "Family physician"--were the same in Estonia and Finland. CONCLUSIONS Even though there are differences in health care systems, the self-images of primary care doctors in both countries were more or less consistent with the international definitions of the general practitioner's job and role.</dc:description>
