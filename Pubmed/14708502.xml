<dc:description xml:lang="en">The agenesis of the gall bladder is a rare congenital abnormality that usually is diagnosed as cholecystolithiasis. Therefore it is an intraoperative discovery. In this work two new cases are added to casuistry; both them have received laparotomic treatment. As those cases were symptomatic patients, the most common clinical manifestations are described. We insist in tactics to discard ectopic locations and the different options for the intraoperative and postoperative study; this last situation seems to be the most used behavior on patients approached laparoscopically.</dc:description>
