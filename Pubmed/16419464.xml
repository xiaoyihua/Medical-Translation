<dc:description xml:lang="en">Current findings suggest that more attention needs to be given to the increase in body mass being achieved by disabled populations in general and individuals with mental retardation in particular, to minimize long-term negative health consequences. Given that physical activity programs have been reported as one of the most effective ways of improving the health of individuals with Down syndrome, it would be of interest facilitate different tools to contribute to their clinical follow-up. Consequently, this study was designed to assess the correlation between anthropometrical parameters and lipid profile in adolescents with Down syndrome. Anthropometric variables such as body mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio as well as serum lipids (total cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, total-cholesterol/high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides) were measured in 21 male adolescents (16.3 +/- 1.1 years) with Down syndrome. Anthropometric parameters presented a positive association with serum lipids except for high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol that was negative. It should be emphasized the strongest association of waist-to-hip ratio to total cholesterol/high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (r = 0.48; p &lt; 0.05). It is concluded waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio may be highly recommended in clinical practice as appropriate anthropometric predictors of lipid profile in adolescents with Down syndrome. Further studies are required to assess their behavior during physical activity programs as well as to determine more correlations in these individuals.</dc:description>
