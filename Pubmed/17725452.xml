<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The gestational hypertension -HG- and preeclampsia -P- are hypertensive diseases whose pathogenic mechanism has not been determined yet. The aim of this work is to define some patterns of vasoactive factors release that allow to explain the origin of the differences between both entities. DESIGN Prospective case-control study. MATERIAL AND METHODS Two groups of target patients were consecutively selected, GH (n=21) and P patients (n=21). Every patient was matched with a pregnant of similar age and week of pregnancy. Two control groups were obtained, one respect to the GH and another one respect to the P group. A biochemistry, blood cell count, coagulation and quantification of vasoactive factors endothelin, nitrites and GMPc were performed in every woman. Results of GH and P groups were compared with their respective control group with the paired Student's t Test. RESULTS Both systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were higher in hypertensive pregnants (GH and P) than in their respective controls. Moreover, blood endothelin and GMPc were higher in GH and P. GH pregnants showed decreased norepinephrine and increased epinephrine urinary excretion , as well as an increased plasma nitrites concentration than control group. P patients did not show statistically significant differences in catecholamines urinary excretion nor in plasma nitrites concentration respect their control group. CONCLUSION There are relevant differences in the synthesis patterns of vasoactive factors between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. These differences could account for a decreased tissue perfusion in preeclampsia and could also contribute to the genesis of the renal dysfunction of this entity.</dc:description>
