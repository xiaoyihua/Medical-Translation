<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS The purpose of this study was to review the peripheral neurological aspects of Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD). DEVELOPMENT AFD is a disease caused by lysosomal deposits that was first reported in 1898. This entity has begun to attract renewed interest in recent years because of the progress made in diagnostic techniques and the appearance of enzyme replacement therapy. This pathological condition is transmitted by recessive inheritance linked to the X chromosome and results from a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which leads to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in endothelial and perithelial cells, as well as those of the smooth muscles in blood vessels, the dorsal root ganglia and other structures in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Symptoms during childhood include: neuropathic pain that is predominantly distal in the four limbs (and expresses itself as severe attacks that are often linked to changes in temperature and exercise that interfere with daily activities), hypohidrosis and angiokeratomas. The most serious complications appear during adulthood and include: kidney failure, heart failure and strokes. CONCLUSION The arrival of enzyme replacement therapy is the first part of a chain in the treatment of AFD, where gene therapy and substrate inhibition therapy are beginning to emerge as real therapeutic alternatives. In spite of all this, at present, the management of painful symptoms is not at all satisfactory for patients and therefore further study and a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved will allow more specific and effective therapeutic measures to be developed with which to provide patients with greater relief.</dc:description>
