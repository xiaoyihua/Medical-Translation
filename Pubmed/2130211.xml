<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present the case of a 40 year old woman, who had an aortic prosthetic valve, of the Björk Shiley type. Three months before admission she began with progressive dyspnea. She was admitted to the Cardiovascular Care Unit with a global cardiac failure. An aortic prosthetic valve thrombosis was diagnosed clinically (absence of the prosthetic click) and by radioscopy (a decrease in the movement of the valve disk, with an incomplete shunt). It was attributed to a secondary failure of the anticoagulant treatment. Despite the treatment she quickly developed a cardiogenic shock. A treatment with 750,000 UI of streptokinase in 30 min was started, followed by 100,000 UI during 12 hours, with total reversion of the hemodynamic features, as judged by clinical examination (recurrence of the prosthetic click), radioscopy (recurrence of the valve movement) and by Doppler echocardiography (reduction of the transvalvular gradient). No complications were observed, and in a follow up of 12 months she persisted asymptomatic. The prosthetic valve thrombosis is an infrequent and almost fatal complication. The classical therapy consists in surgery which is a procedure with a high mortality in patients with severe cardiac failure, and an emergency procedure, as it occurred in our patient. Despite the known success of the thrombolytic therapy in the prosthetic valve thrombosis of the right heart (tricuspid position) it was only in the last years that this treatment was reported in aortic or mitral position. Peripheric embolies were found in 13% of the cases, always with transitory symptoms. There are only 45 cases described in the world, and more experience is needed for definitive conclusions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
