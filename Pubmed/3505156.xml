<dc:description xml:lang="en">Digestive tract cancer mortality rates are described in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 1950 to 1979. Total digestive tract cancer rates obtained from the world population and adjusted by age and by fifteen years periods show similar annual average decrease for both sexes (1.08%). The above mentioned rates have been shown to decrease in people under 79 years and they were slightly increased in those over 80 years. Total cancer mortality rate has shown an increase of 0.14% annual average (0.18% and 0.10% for male and female, respectively). Mortality cancer rates found in four different levels of the digestive tract have shown different results. Mortality rate at the esophagus level showed an average decrease of 1.17% (1.42% and 0.92% for female and male respectively), this results from a decrease in population of females over 45 and males over 65 years. The highest decrease was observed in stomach cancer mortality rates similar for both sexes (annual average 1.44%). This decrease was found in people within 15 and 79 years; while, the mortality rates found in people over 80 were steady showing a slight increase. Cancer column mortality rate depicts an increase for both sexes, showing an annual average of 0.71% (0.84% and 0.64% for male and female, respectively). Partially adjusted rates show different behaviours: decreasing in both sexes within 15 and 44 years, and increasing in those over 80 years; but increasing in males and slightly decreasing in females within 45 and 79 years. Rectum cancer mortality rates show an increase in females (annual average 1.21%) and a decrease in females (annual average 0.47%), showing a general increase in males, except for those within 65 and 79 years, while for females under 79 years the rates were decreased and increased in those over 80 years.</dc:description>
