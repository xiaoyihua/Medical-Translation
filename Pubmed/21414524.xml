<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To evaluate the autofluorescence findings in patients diagnosed with pseudoxanthoma elasticum. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective study was conducted on 18 eyes of 9 patients who had ocular pathology andfollowed up in the pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PSX) unit of our hospital. We evaluated the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), colour and autofluorescence photography (AF), and fluorescein angiography (FA) in patients with choroidal neovascularitation. RESULTS Of the 9 patients, 7 were women and 2 were men. The mean age was 40 +/- 14 years. The BCVA ranged from 1 to 0.01 (Mean 0.65 +/- 0.4). All patients showed PSX injuries. Angioid streaks (AS) 18 (100%), peau d'orange 16 (87.5%) and pigmented fibrotic plates 5 (31,5%). We observed different hypoautofluorescence patterns (RPE atrophy), of which 2 of them were AS patterns (irregular lines with hyperautofluorescence speckled in its interior and edges, or bands with lobulated lesions inside and hyperautofluorescence at the edges), and finally widespread areas of hypoautofluorescence, larger than observed by ophthalmoscope. CONCLUSIONS Autofluorescence in patients with PSX is an easy method to evaluate the initial level of ophthalmoscopic involvement and its subsequent progression. The extensive changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) suggests the important role of this in the physiopathology of the disease.</dc:description>
