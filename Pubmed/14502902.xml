<dc:description xml:lang="en">Menopause is a very important period in the life of a woman due to the physiological and psychological changes which happen during this period. The authors apply an educational program providing integrated attention to women during this phase of their lives to evaluate possible improvements in the conflictive aspects which menopause generates. The authors carried out a longitudinal study with interventions before and after their study. The sample was a group of 28 women between the ages of 45 and 64. The educational intervention consisted of the application of a program providing integrated attention to women by the Generalitat Valenciana, the autonomous government in the Valencia Autonomous Region. This program had a positive influence on the knowledge and aptitudes of these women regarding this period of their lives. Their physical and psychological health improved, with a decrease in the most common symptoms caused by menopause and there were very significant differences found on the Kupperman test. The application of this program succeeded in relating the material taught to these women with a positive repercussion in their physical, psychological and social states during their climacteric years.</dc:description>
