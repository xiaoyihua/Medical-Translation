<dc:description xml:lang="en">Regular practice of dynamic physical exercise produces cardiovascular, metabolical, biochemical, hematological and endocrine changes among the most important ones. To reach the majority of these effects, it is not necessary to perform particularly intense training. The equivalent to one hour of active walking per day would be sufficient. However, the improvement of the physical condition is only achieved with specific training programmes. Changes originated by training are due to the effects of the actual exercise and to the modifications of the cardiovascular risk factors. Apart from this, the repercussion of regular physical exercise on conduct and personality should not be underestimated. Physical exercise is a complementary treatment measure which turns out to be the more efficacious the best prevention measures and conventional treatments are complied with.</dc:description>
