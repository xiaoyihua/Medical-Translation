<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The magnitude of the epidemic depends upon the scope of the contaminated product distributed. In the spring of 2000, an episode caused by the sale of sausage products which had not undergone health inspection. The purpose of this study is to provide an epidemiological description of the outbreak caused by Trichinella britovi. METHODS Descriptive study of the control measures and those affected. The food products contaminated with this parasite was investigated by means of an epidemiological survey. RESULTS Thirty-eight (38) cases were reported throughout weeks 18-22 of the epidemic. The symptoms most often reported were fever, myalgia and palpebral edema. Eighty-seven percent (87%) of those affected tested positive for eosinophilia. Forty percent (40%) required hospitalization. Late diagnosis was curtailed once the alert had been broadcast. T. Britovi was found in the sausage product. CONCLUSIONS Trichinellosis epidemics can occur despite the current inspection and control systems, placing food safety at risk. Broadcasting a health alert curtails late diagnosis. We propose intensifying health education and continuing the implementation of duly supervised and evaluated self-check programs in industries and establishments. A well-tuned, fast-reacting epidemiological monitoring system must be kept in place.</dc:description>
