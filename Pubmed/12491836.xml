<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Malaria was restricted to the I Region of Chile, being Anopheles pseudopunctipennis the only vector species. In 1936 the parasitosis affected more than 50% of the population and 62.4% of military recruits, proceeding from Southern regions became infected. From 1937 to 1947, an antimalaria campaign was carried out, stressing actions on the battle against the vector and the treatment of malaria infected individuals. Since April 1945 no autochthonous cases of malaria have been detected. AIM To update the situation of malaria in Chile. METHODS 1) Imported malaria: Analysis of occasional publications on the subject (1945-1988) and the annual reports of the Ministry of Health Department of Epidemiology (1990-2001). Annual reports on the Anopheles specimens collected--mostly larvae--in the provinces of Arica and Iquique and examined in the Parasitology Unit of the School of Medicine, University of Chile, during the period 1980-2001. RESULTS 1) Imported malaria. A total of 24 cases were published in the period 1945-1988. In the 1980-2001 period, the Ministry of Health recorded 66 cases with 5 (8.8%) deaths. 2) Anophelines: Only in 1984, 1985, 1998 and 2001 A. pseudopunctipennis foci were detected. Entomological surveillance was stressed and insecticides were applied on these focuses. CONCLUSIONS Autochthonous malaria does not exist in Chile since 1945. The detection of malaria cases in countries where the parasitosis was eradicated, can be the result of tourism or migrations. In Chile, the Environmental Programs of Arica and Iquique perform periodical surveys in localities where mosquitoes exist. When A. pseudopunctipennis is found, the entomological vigilance is stressed and insecticide applications are reiterated until the situation is controlled.</dc:description>
