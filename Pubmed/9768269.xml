<dc:description xml:lang="en">The results of a validation study of the ultramicroanalitical assay for the detection of antibodies against the hepatitis B surface antigen (UMELISA anti-HBsAg), which was carried out by comparing the results obtained with the Hepanostika anti-HBsAg, commercial diagnosis kit are presented. For this purpose, sera from the clinical assays of the Cuban recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B were used. With the first sera group (n = 30) it was obtained, 93.1% of sensitivity, 98.5% of specificity and a concordance of 94.3%. The correlation coefficient showed a similar trend of the results (p &lt; 0.01) and no significant differences were found in the average geometrical titre (TPG) between both assays (p &gt; 0.05). With the second group (n = 100), whose assays were carried out at the "Pedro Kouri" Institute of Tropical Medicine (PKI) and at the Immunoassay Center (IAC) simultaneously, it was observed a sensitivity of 96.25% in both centers, a specificity of 75% at the PKI and of 90% at the IAC, and a coincidence of 92% and 95%, respectively. The correlation coefficient presented similar values and there were no significant differences between the TPG obtained by the two methods (p &gt; 0.05). The results attained show in general the validity of the new assay and the feasibility to put it into practice either for following up the infection, or for carrying out clinical assays of vaccine evaluations.</dc:description>
