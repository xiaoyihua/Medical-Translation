<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To describe the findings of the study of autofluorescence of the different retinal diseases included in the study. To determine in which diseases autofluorescence may be more, or just as, useful as fluorescein angiography (FAG) in terms of diagnostic information. MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied the retinal autofluorescence of 123 eyes of 93 patients, including various diseases of the eye fundus. In all cases we explored the fundus, retinal autofluorescence, and, if indicated, FAG was performed. Analysis of the autofluorescence was performed using the Heidelberg Retina angiography Angiograph 2 (HRA2) Heidelberg Engineering (Germany). RESULTS The autofluorescence information provided was equal or better (than FAG) in: 68.18% of cases of macular edema, 50% of pigment epithelium detachments, 100% of pigment epithelium atrophies, 100% of central serous chorioretinopathy; 55.55% of choroidal neovascularization, 100% of retinal dystrophies with deposition of lipofuscin, 100% of hard exudates and pre-retinal hemorrhages. CONCLUSIONS Autofluorescence is a quick and non-invasive examination method, comfortable for both patient and examiner, and with a very short learning curve. It provides diagnostic information about many eye fundus diseases. While more studies and more experience with its use are needed, its interest lies in the possibility of avoiding the performing of angiography in patients with these diseases, and in the additional information autofluorescence provides about the functional situation of cells and retinal pigments.</dc:description>
