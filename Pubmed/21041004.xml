<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE to assess the applicability on a national level of the interventions proposed by Peter Pronovost et al in Michigan state for the prevention of central vascular catheter-related bacteremia (B-CVC) in patients admitted to the ICU. DESIGN pilot, prospective and comparative study. SETTING eighteen ICUs (9 control and 9 intervention) from three autonomous communities in Spain during 3 months in 2007 participated in the study. INTERVENTION the following activities were included: a) training program for health care personnel, b) introduction of specific measures related to the insertion and care of CVC (catheter insertion checklist, basic recommendations for maintenance of central catheters, dedicated cart for venous accesses, information poster with the five procedures proposed to reduce bacteremias: hands hygiene, use of maximal aseptic barriers during insertion, asepsis of the skin at the insertion point with chlorhexidine, avoidance of the femoral access, and removal of all CVC) and c) measures aiming to promote the culture of safe daily work (daily objectives, learning from mistakes, safety rounds). RESULTS the rate of B-CVC expressed as mean values has shown a half reduction as compared with historical registers. Different problems in the implementation of specific measures related to catheters and safety tools were identified. CONCLUSIONS the intervention project assessed in the pilot study may be viable on the national level. It is necessary to modify and adapt to the Spanish reality the interventions proposed.</dc:description>
