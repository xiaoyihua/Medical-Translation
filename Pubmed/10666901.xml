<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyze the patients diagnosed of infectious mononucleosis (IM) in our institution, in order to study the symptoms and clinical evolution. MATERIAL AND METHOD We retrospectively analyse 37 hospitalized children aged between 3 months and 14 years. Diagnosed of IM by production of immunoglobulin M (IgM) to viral capsid antigen (VCA). RESULT In our series of 37 children, 14 were less than 4 years old. Among clinical data, lymphadenopathy (86%), fever (81%) and pharyngotonsillitis (70%) were the more striking. We found jaundice only in three of the older children. Upper airways obstruction was common, and specially severe in young children. Three patients developed pneumonia during the disease course. Only ten patients produced heterophile antibodies. Two children showed dual antibody rises to Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus. Corticotherapy was used in 7 children. The complications are presented in 68% of patients. CONCLUSIONS Clinical aspects of IM were similar to those in the young adult, and complications occur more frequently. We found lack of heterophile antibodies, more frequent in youngest.</dc:description>
