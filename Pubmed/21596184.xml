<dc:description xml:lang="en">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, corticoids and antihistamines, as well as a great many other molecules, have classically been used to control the symptoms of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), with very few encouraging results. Knowledge of its genetic character, and its aetiopathogenesis associated with inflammasome and the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) has led to the development of new therapeutic weapons that have not just obtained improvements of the symptoms and quality of life of the patients, but also managed to control the underlying inflammation. Results show that anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist molecule, improved the clinical symptoms and the inflammatory markers of patients with CAPS has motivated research with other molecules directed against IL-1: rilonacept and canakinumab. It is likely that the use of these molecules could prevent the development of the late complications associated with chronic inflammation.</dc:description>
