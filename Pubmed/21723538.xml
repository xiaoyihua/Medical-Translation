<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Lower limb varicose veins are often secondary to greater saphenous vein (GSV) insufficiency. Technological development has led to the appearance of new minimally invasive treatments, such as endovenous radiofrequency ablation (ERFA). This almost completely eliminates the disadvantages associated with conventional surgery (haematomas, scars, inguinal neovascularisation, and a prolonged time off work). Furthermore, it gives a better quality of life, less pain and inflammation than the endolaser. We review ERFA and present our results as a pioneering group in Spain. Between January 2006 and 2011 we have treated 153 limbs with a mean GSV diameter of 6.8 mm (range 4.5-19). Tumescent anaesthesia was exclusively used in 71% of the procedures, and 98.5% without an inguinal surgical approach. Clinical and ultrasound follow-up with a prospective register was performed at 1 week, 3, 6, 12 months, and then annually. RESULTS The occlusion rate of the treated vein was 97%, and there was a reflux rate of 6.6%. Inguinal neovascularisation was present on 0.7%. There was no neuritis, skin burns or deep vein thrombosis.</dc:description>
