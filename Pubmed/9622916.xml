<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the incidence of non-urothelial neoplasms in patients with infiltrating bladder tumor submitted to radical surgery. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted in patients who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy for an infiltrating bladder tumor from 1987-1996. The pathological and follow-up data were analyzed. RESULTS Of 120 patients submitted to radical cystoprostatectomy for an infiltrating bladder tumor, 23 (19%) had an associated non-urothelial neoplasm: 14 (61%) were metachronous and 9 (39%) were synchronous. Two patients had two secondary tumors (9%). CONCLUSION We have found a high incidence of non-urothelial tumor in patients with infiltrating bladder tumor. By order of frequency, these were prostate cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pulmonary cancer, etc. Studies have ascribed the association of prostate and bladder cancer to the deletion of suppressor genes.</dc:description>
