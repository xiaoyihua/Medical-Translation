<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Narcissistic personality is an important component of personality disorders which are prevalent in those presenting drug abuse or dependence. Assessment instruments usually consider self-esteem, narcissism and covert narcissism, but although Spanish versions of instruments for self-esteem and narcissism are available, there is no available test for covert narcissism. OBJECTIVE. To test the validity of the Spanish version of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in individuals presenting drug abuse or dependence. METHOD In a sample of 79 outpatients, we assessed reliability by means of Cronbach's alpha and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), construct validity through factor analysis, and concurrent validity by means of the correlation between the HSNS and measures of severity, disability, self-esteem, grandiose narcissism and personality disorders. RESULTS Reliability of the HSNS total scale score was satisfactory (Cronbach's alpha = 0,73, ICC = 0,67), though some items would require further consideration. Factor analysis showed good construct validity with three factors compatible with the theory of covert narcissism. With regard to concurrent validity, covert narcissism (HSNS) correlated positively with open narcissism, severity and disability due to drug use, and negatively with self-esteem. Highest scores on the HSNS corresponded to borderline, narcissistic and passive-aggressive personality disorders. CONCLUSIONS The Spanish version of the HSNS could be a valid instrument for the assessment of covert narcissism in those treated for drug abuse or dependence.</dc:description>
