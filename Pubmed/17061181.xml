<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS The treatment of lysosomal diseases has undergone a number of significant changes in recent decades. Here we review the different therapeutic approaches that can be used: the well-consolidated haematopoietic stem-cell transplants (HST) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), the new therapeutic strategies with small molecules such as substrate reduction therapy (SRT) or enzyme 'enhancement' therapy (EET) and experimental approaches like gene therapy. DEVELOPMENT We review the status of ERT in general and more particularly in Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, Pompe disease and the first stages of Hunter disease and Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome. Their outcomes, indications, safety and side effects are also evaluated. We examine the value of HST in these diseases and more particularly in Hurler syndrome, Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome, globoid cell leukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy and Gaucher disease. The initial results from using SRT, EET and with gene therapy are briefly outlined. CONCLUSIONS A great deal of progress has been made in the treatment of some lysosomal diseases in recent decades due to careful use of HST and ERT. Furthermore, the application of the latest therapeutic instruments such as SRT and EET opens up new perspectives in this field.</dc:description>
