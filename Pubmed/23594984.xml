<dc:description xml:lang="en">The idiopathic avascular necrosis of the scaphoid or Preiser's disease is condition about which few cases have been described. In the majority of cases, it is debatable whether it is actually a spontaneous osteonecrosis, or a pathological process secondary to a systematic disease, or a result of chemotherapy treatment, or associated with taking steroids. We present the case of a 20-year old woman, with no previous trauma, with pain in her right wrist, which progressed over a period of four years. It was wrongly diagnosed as a tendinitis, and was treated conservatively without any improvement. A simple X-ray was requested that showed an abnormality of the proximal pole of the scaphoid that was beginning to fragment; a fact which was confirmed later by performing a CT scan. This was followed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), which showed signs of ischaemia, mainly in the proximal pole. There were signs of viability in the distal fragment in the NMR using paramagnetic contrast. After the imaging tests, idiopathic avascular necrosis of the scaphoid was diagnosed. The surgical treatment consisted of the removal of necrotic fragments of the proximal pole and removal of the posterior interosseous-nerve. Two years after the intervention, the patient is asymptomatic and with a complete range of movement in the operated wrist.</dc:description>
