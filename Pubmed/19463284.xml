<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Micafungin is a echinocandin. It inhibits beta-1,3-D-glucan synthesis, thus achieving fungicidal activity against virtually all Candida spp., including those resistant to fluconazole, and fungistatic activity against Aspergillus spp., as well as several but not all pathogenic molds. Results from in vitro studies, animal models, small clinical trials, hint at possible future indications such as invasive aspergillosis and empirical viantifungal therapy, although currently there is little information published. AIMS To describe published data of micafungin as treatment against invasive mold infections, specially analysing its role in the inmunodepressed host and critical care setting. METHODS A systematic review of literature using the principal medical search engines was performed. Terms such as micafungin, aspergillosis, zygomycosis, invasive fungal infections, emerging fungal infections, antifungal treatment or therapy, antifungal prophylaxis, empiric or pre-emptive therapy were crossed. Febrile neutropenia patients were excluded. RESULTS Several studies in these setting were identified and were described in this review. Although there were no blinded randomized clinical trials published, treatment or prophylaxis of invasive aspergillosis and other invasive mould infections with micafungin described in open clinical studies were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS Micafungin could play a future important role as a primary or rescue therapy, alone or in combination, in the treatment or prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections caused by moulds. New randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm their efficacy.</dc:description>
