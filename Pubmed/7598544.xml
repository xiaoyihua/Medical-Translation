<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES This paper describes our MAS (major ambulatory surgery) unit and its application in urology. METHODS We reviewed our series of 415 patients seen over a period of 14 months; of these, 71 (17%) did not meet the criteria and the remaining 344 patients (83%), with ages ranging from 6 months to 78 years, were treated in our MAS unit. Surgery was performed for circumcision, cryptorchidism, PVCP and hydrocele. RESULTS Only 2 (0.5%) of the patients were hospitalized and 5 (1.4%) were reoperated. The degree of patient satisfaction was over 90%. CONCLUSIONS 1. MAS is efficacious in providing care and efficiently resolves difficult urological cases. 2. Patient satisfaction is very high and there were only a few complications in the patients treated in this unit.</dc:description>
