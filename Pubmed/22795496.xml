<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Erdheim-Chester disease (EC) is a rare form of non-Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. It is characterized by the xanthomatous infiltration of tissues with foamy CD68+/CD1a- histiocytes. We report a series of 12 patients diagnosed with EC. PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed the clinical, pathological and therapeutic aspects of 12 cases diagnosed with EC at 7 tertiary teaching hospitals in Spain. Patients were included if tissue infiltration by histiocytes CD68+/CD1a- could be demonstrated in an appropriate clinical setting. RESULTS Twelve patients (7 male) were included. Median follow-up was 36 months (IQR: 20-84). The median age at the time of clinical onset and pathological diagnosis was 49 (IQR: 28-61) and 56 years (IQR: 37-62), respectively. In 6 cases multiples biopsies were performed (skin, muscle, testicular) previous to diagnosis, which was confirmed in 3 cases after a carefully review of pathological tissues. Neurological involvement was independently associated with mortality (P&lt;.05). Characteristic long bone osteosclerosis was detected in 9 patients. CONCLUSION EC is a multisystemic and heterogeneous clinicopathological condition. A high index of suspicion and fluent communication between clinicians and pathologists is necessary to achieve a correct diagnosis.</dc:description>
