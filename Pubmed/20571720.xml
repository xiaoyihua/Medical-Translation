<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND On the 4th of February 2008, 2 cases of measles, epidemiologically linked (2 members of the crew of the Fast-Ferry Jaime I from the company Balearia, which performs the route Algeciras-Tangier), were notified to the Epidemiological Surveillance Network in Andalusia (SVEA). The aim of this paper is to epidemiologically characterize this population level outbreak detected in the area of Campo de Gibraltar, the vaccine effectiveness and the control measures implemented. METHODS Descriptive observational study of reported cases. We have analysed the following variables: age, sex, municipality of residence, onset date, virus genotype, groups involved, previous immunization status, interventions, vaccine effectiveness. Information sources are SVEA records, vaccination program and individual digital story (Diraya). Rates 10(5) were calculated according to age group and frequency measurements. To compare vaccine effectiveness, the Chi(2) test was used. RESULTS We confirmed 155 cases of measles, 88.4% by laboratory techniques. Most affected age groups under 2 years (19%) and from 21 to 40 (51%). The 54.2% male. The 72,14% were not vaccinated. Virus was isolated from imported measles genotype D4. The vaccine efficacy was greater than 99%. CONCLUSIONS The outbreak of the imported measles virus was confirmed. More than half of the cases were not vaccinated. The decrease in the incidence in vaccinated individuals recommends the necessity of carrying out Catch-Up campaigns to increase the coverage therefore avoiding the appearance of these outbreaks.</dc:description>
