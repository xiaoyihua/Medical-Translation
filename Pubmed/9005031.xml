<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Addiction to tobacco is the main cause of preventive morbidity, and so the fight against tobacco consumption is a priority in the developed world. Health advice is a valuable tool in this struggle and it is within the reach of all health workers. To study the long-term effectiveness of all anti-tobacco advice in Primary Aid, together with the influence that the reason for giving up (spontaneous or after advice) has upon the relapse pattern. METHOD We carried out a clinical test on 501 patients, 242 as a participant group, receiving health advice, and 259 in a control group. We evaluated giving up the habit through a survey. The data were analysed by means of a study with a survival study, considering the relapse to be the final point. Survival curves for the two groups were compared with the Lee-Desu statistic. RESULTS 115 patients gave up the habit for at least 24 hours (31.8% from the participant and 14.7% from the control group). After 3 years, after a biochemical check-up, 4.5% of the participant group and 1.2% of the control group were still ex-smokers (difference = 3.3; p = 0.043%; there is a confidence interval of 95%: from 0.45 to 6.33). We did not find significant differences between their survival curves (p = 0.08). CONCLUSION We have been able to confirm the mid- to long-term effectiveness of anti-tobacco advice. We have not been able to demonstrate that anti-tobacco advice in the relapse pattern, but a statistical trend does exist towards a reduction in the participant group.</dc:description>
