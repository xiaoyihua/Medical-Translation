<dc:description xml:lang="en">Vasectomy is an ever-increasingly used contraceptive method owing to its effectiveness and easy execution, although various studies have questioned its innocuousness. We have studied various parameters in 70 patients three months before and after the vasectomy was performed. The analytical factors controlled were as follows: glycemia, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, FSH, LH, testosterone and estradiol. Other data handled were arterial tension and body weight index. We questioned them about physical activity, distributing them into three groups, and about family history of arteriosclerosis, distributing them into two groups. Three months after the operation we found an increase in body weight index of 24.11 +/- 2.49 to 24.77 +/- 2.51, with a p less than 0.01. Total cholesterol also rose from 201 Cae 39 mgr% to 208 +/- 38 mgr% with a p less than 0.05. We also observed a drop in arterial tension. Patients with no family history of arteriosclerosis had an increase of total cholesterol of 199 +/- 39 mgr% to 210 +/- 35 mgr% with a p less than 0.001. In the heavy smoker group, total cholesterol also rose from 203 %/- 48 mgr% to 214 +/- 40 mgr% with a p less than 0.05. We discuss our results and our surgical complications and our conclusion in that, based on our study, we cannot assert the vasectomy plays a role as a risk factor of arteriosclerosis.</dc:description>
