<dc:description xml:lang="en">An optimized formulation of pate was developed using rainbow trout discard with the employment ofTaguchi methodology, taking into account that the health-promoting benefits of this resource makes it a viable alternative as a functional foods to help consumers to get a healthy lifestyle. The optimization process utilizing Taguchi methodology was carried out in two phases. First, an orthogonal array L(8)2(7) with seven independent variables was chosen to select the control factors with a significant effect on the sensory quality (SQ). As a result, the following independent variables were selected: merkén pepper, sodium chloride, vegetal lard and margarine. In the second stage the L(9)3(4) orthogonal array was used. Data were analysed using differences between average values of factors according working levels, and also ANOVA, summing up that merken pepper, sodium chloride and margarine showed a significant effect (p &gt; 0.05) on the SQ. Best combination turned to be: merkén 0.7%, sodium chloride 1.3%, vegetal lard 5.2% and margarine 5.2%. Among the chemical characteristics highlighted protein 13.8%, lipid 10.21%, caloric density 175 Kcal/100 g and cholesterol 46 mg/100 g. Shelf life study during a period of time of 6 weeks at 5 degrees C expressed as mesophyl aerobic count (MAC) and peroxide index were 1.6E+0.4 ufc/g and 8.44 meg O2/Kg respectively, both characteristics lower than the maximum limits allowed for chilean regulations. Concerning to the acceptability of the optimized product the hedonic test showed 91% approval and also 87% of consumers would be well disposed to buy this product.</dc:description>
