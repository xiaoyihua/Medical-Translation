<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this research was to determine the survival of Listeria monocytogenes in sterile skim milk during the fermentation with a yogurt starter culture and during storage at refrigeration temperature. Sterile skim milk was inoculated with 10(3), 10(5) and 10(7) cfu/ml of L. monocytogenes and with 10(6) cfu of lactic acid bacteria. Inoculated milks were fermented for 8 h at 42 degrees C, followed by refrigeration at 4 degrees C. Samples were taken at 2 h intervals during fermentation and at 2 days intervals during storage. Acidity and pH were measured, as well as viable count of lactic acid bacteria and pathogen. L. monocytogenes survived 8h, 10 days and 32 days in the fermented milk, when the inocula were 10(3), 10(5) and 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. Inhibition of the pathogen was associated with a decrease of pH below 4.0 and increase in acidity. It was demonstrated that this pathogen is able to survive several weeks in milk fermented with a starter culture, contrary to the general belief which considered it very difficult due to the low pH. Therefore fermented milks may play an important role in the transmission of these bacteria.</dc:description>
