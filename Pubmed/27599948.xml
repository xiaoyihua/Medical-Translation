<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND It is estimated that 1% of the general population suffers from severe mental illness (SMI). In most cases, families are the ones providing support and direct care to the ill relative, which in turn results in the family being the unit that lives with the mental illness. In Spain, two key aspects have been barely explored: the relationship between the family and the mental health system; and the knowledge of families and the possible transfer of such knowledge to other families. The aim of this paper is to contribute to exploring these two aspects. METHODS A qualitative study with a narrative approach was implemented in the Foral Community of Navarre (Spain). The study consisted of in-depth interviews with families living with SMI. Two interviews were conducted with each family (which included the individual diagnosed with a mental illness). A multimodal analysis (structural, thematic and dialogical) was conduc-ted with each family. Comparative analyses between families were also performed. RESULTS A total of 6 families were interviewed with a total of 18 participants. Findings were grouped around two central catego-ries: requirements of families and family to family. The first category includes improving relationships with mental health provi-ders, medications, psychosocial rehabilitation centers and supporting families. The second category includes recommendations from the perspective of the relative with a SMI and those without it. CONCLUSIONS Families would like to receive a higher degree of support from mental-health providers. At the same time, families should be considered as important sources of knowledge and support for the treatment of other families living with SMI.</dc:description>
