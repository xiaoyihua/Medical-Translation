<dc:description xml:lang="en">Anidulafungin is a new and very useful pharmacological tool for the treatment of invasive mycoses. The antifungal spectrum of anidulafungin reaches the most common pathogenic fungi. Anidulafungin is especially active against the genera Candida and Aspergillus. Its antifungal mechanism is based on the inhibition of the beta-1,3-D-glucan synthesis, an essential molecule for the cell wall architecture, with different consequences for Candida and Aspergillus, being anidulafungin fungicide for the former and fungistatic for the latter. This review describes the in vitro antifungal spectrum of anidulafungin based in the scientific and medical literature of recent years. We can underline that most than 99% of Candida isolates are susceptible to &lt; or = 2 microg/ml of anidulafungin. MIC are very low (&lt; or =0.125 microg/ml) for most clinical isolates of the species Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei while Candida parapsilosis and Candida guilliermondii isolates are susceptible to anidulafungin concentrations &lt; or = 2 microg/ml. An excellent activity of anidulafungin has been also described against Aspergillus, Pneumocystis and other fungi. However, its activity is very low against Cryptococcus and the Zygomycetes. The excellent activity of anidulafungin has made this antifungal a first line therapeutic indication for candidemia and invasive candidiasis in non-neutropenic patients.</dc:description>
