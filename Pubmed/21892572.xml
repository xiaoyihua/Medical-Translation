<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Nutritional support (NS) leads complications that must be detected and prompt treated. OBJECTIVE To estimate the incidence of some complications of nutritional support in critically ill patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS A multicenter, descriptive, prospective study in patients with NS in intensive care units. Studied variables included medical diagnosis, nutritional status, length of NS, path, type of formula and ten complications. RESULTS 419 patients evaluated, 380 received enteral nutrition (EN) and 39 parenteral nutrition (PN). The high gastric residue was the most incident complication in the ENS (24.2%), followed by diarrhea (14%) and withdrawal tube (6.6%). The high gastric residue and diarrhea were associated with the duration of the NS (p &lt; 0.05). For the PNS the complication most incidents were hypophosphatemia (38.5%), followed by catheter sepsis (15.4%). The duration of the NS was associated with cholestasis, sepsis and hypophosphatemia (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS complications of highest incidence were the high gastric residue for EN and hypophosphatemia for the PN; the withdrawal of the tube is a complication that claims further monitoring. The duration of the NS was the variable that showed greater association with the complications studied. Is a must to get consensus on complications definitions for comparisons establishment and best international standards target, furthermore propose protocols in order to decrease complications incidence of NS to fulfill the critical ill patient requirements.</dc:description>
