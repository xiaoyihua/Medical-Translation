<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The incidence of diverticular disease of the colon has been rising in recent years, and the associated factors are: low ingestion of fibre, age, lack of physical activity, and obesity. METHODS A retrospective, descriptive, observational study was conducted on patients with the diagnosis of complicated diverticular disease requiring surgical or interventional treatment, for a period of 12 years. RESULTS A total of 114 patients (72 males, and 42 females), age range 28-91 years. More than three-quarters (88 patients; 77.19%) had a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 40 kg/m(2), and 26 patients (22.8%) had a BMI between 20 and 25 kg/m(2). Among the patients with BMI less than 25 kg/m(2), 12 patients had Hinchey 1 (46%), 8 Hinchey 2 (30.7%), 4 Hinchey 3 (15.4%), and two Hinchey 4 (7.7%). Of the patients with BMI greater than 25 kg/m(2), 19 patients had Hinchey 1 (21.6%), 24 Hinchey 2 (27.3%), 27 Hinchey 3 (30.7%), and 18 Hinchey 4 (20.45%). A statistically significant difference (P&lt;0.001) was found between groups using Mann-Whitney U test. The BMI greater than 25 kg/m(2) as risk factor for complicated diverticular disease showed Odds Ratio of 3.4884 (95% confidence interval 1.27-9.55) with Z value of 2.44 (P=0.014). CONCLUSIONS In this study, obesity was associated with an increased incidence and severity of complicated diverticular disease.</dc:description>
