<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Alternating hemiplegia (AH) of childhood is a rare disease that gives rise to transient attacks of hemiplegia that may affect either side of the body indistinctly, or even both sides at the same time. Onset occurs before the age of 18 months and in some cases there are neonatal symptoms such as abnormal eye movements, especially nystagmus, and dystonic or tonic seizures. Attacks of hemiplegia, which disappear during sleep, begin before the age of one year. These symptoms can initially be taken for an epileptic disorder. CASE REPORTS We describe the study of two male patients whose clinical symptoms appeared at the age of 6 months, with tonic seizures, upward deviation of gaze, without loss of consciousness, which occurred with a recurrence rate of between one and two attacks a week or several times a day. They were initially treated with antiepileptic drugs (AED), although the complementary tests, including electroencephalogram (EEG), computerised axial tomography (TAC), magnetic resonance (MR) scans and metabolic tests, were all normal. CONCLUSIONS Since, to date, no specific test has been confirmed for the disease, diagnosis is essentially clinical and by exclusion. Treatment is symptomatic using flunarizine. In one of our cases, administration of a single 10 mg/day dose this drug at night lowered the frequency of the attacks of hemiplegia. The possibility of treating a patient who is a carrier of an AH with AED makes early knowledge and identification of this disease necessary in order to be able to improve the patient's prognosis.</dc:description>
