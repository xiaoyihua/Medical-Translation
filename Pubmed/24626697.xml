<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To estimate the proportion of Mexican households in food insecurity (FI) and their distribution in relation to nutrition and socioeconomic conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated information from 40 809 households. FI was measured using a harmonized version for Mexico of the Latin American and Caribbean food Security Scale. Households were classified according to the level of food insecurity as follows: Food security, mild, moderate and severe FI. We describe the distribution of FI according to some household socioeconomic variables. RESULTS Nationally, 28.2% of households had moderate or severe FI. Rural, indigenous ethnicity and household deprivation were risk factors moderate to severe FI (35.4, 42.2 and 45.9%, respectively). Severe FI was also associated with lower children height and weight. CONCLUSIONS Multi-sectorial actions are needed to address the basic needs of households with moderate and severe FI.</dc:description>
