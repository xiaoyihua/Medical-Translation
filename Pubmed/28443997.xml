<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objectives To estimate the prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety in mothers from three population areas in the state of San Luis Potosí, Mexico, and to analyze the association between these symptoms and the emotional health of their children. Methods Assessment was conducted on 173 mother-child pairs from three different population areas: urban, rural, and indigenous rural. Women's symptoms of depression and anxiety were evaluated, together with their children's behavioral problems. Results A high prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety was found in the three areas included. The proportion of depressive symptoms was highest in the urban and rural areas (38.7% and 38.6%, respectively). The highest prevalence of anxiety symptoms was observed in the rural area (31.8%). The strongest association between maternal anxiety and maternal depression was found in the rural area (odds ratio [OR] = 11.0; 95% CI: 1.3-95.5). The indigenous rural area showed the highest prevalence of behavioral problems among children (61%). An association between such problems and maternal anxiety (OR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1-4.3) and maternal depression (OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3-4.6) was noted. Conclusions The mental health of mothers can put the social and emotional well-being of their children at risk. This conclusion is supported by the findings, namely high prevalences and an association between symptoms of anxiety and depression and behavioral problems. In Mexico, reliable information on the mental health status of women and children in the three population areas studied is needed in order to implement measures towards expanding coverage for evaluation and prevention.</dc:description>
