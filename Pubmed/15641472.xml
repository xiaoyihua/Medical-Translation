<dc:description xml:lang="en">Obesity is an important world-wide public health problem. One of the most deletereous metabolic derangements of the disease is the dyslipidemia frequently involved that is highly atherogenic. The usual phenotypic pattern is fasting hypertriglyceridemia, non-HDL post-prandial hyperlipidemia anda real increased production of small-dense LDL particles, as well as low production of HDL cholesterol. An integral therapeutic plan on obese dyslipidemic patients must include always the identification and management of risk factors that interact within the disease, as well as to know its pharmacological risk-benefit ratio. In the future, new therapeutic tools targeting deranged metabolic pathways (as pharmacogenomics) could correct in a cascade fashion other comorbid conditions commonly found in obesity.</dc:description>
