<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, in which an autoimmune mechanism participates, triggering an accelerated keratopoiesis. Its etiology is unknown; environmental factors, trauma, and infections are involved. The aim of this paper is to present the correlation between the index of severity of psoriasis and quality of life in patients with psoriasis. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study in 72 patients with psoriasis, older than 15 years old, who agreed to participate in the study. We applied the Dermatology Life Quality Index and the Psoriasis Severity Index; descriptive statistics, measures of central tendency, dispersion, and correlation measures were used. RESULTS Patients (n = 72), were 43% male, 57% female, with a mean age 51.22 (15-77) ± 14.05 years. Education: bachelor's degree 23.6%, housework occupation 26.4%, duration of the disease 12.25 (1-50) ± 10.58 years. Psoriasis plaques occurred in 88.9%, the Psoriasis Severity Index was mild in 70.8%. The result of the impact on quality of life was moderate in effect in 33.3%, the difference between the degree of involvement of the disease and the impact on quality of life was p = 0.104, and correlation between the quality of life and degree of psoriasis was p = 0.463. CONCLUSION Quality of life is independent of the degree of disease in patients with psoriasis.</dc:description>
