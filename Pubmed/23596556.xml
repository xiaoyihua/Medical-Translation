<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Cervical foraminotomy is an operation designed to decompress a single or multiple cervical nerve roots from a posterior approach. This type of surgery is an alternative to operations designed to accomplish the same goal from an anterior approach. We describe our experience in patients treated with posterior cervical foraminotomy. METHODS Between January 2008 and December 2011, 17 patients (18 foraminotomies) were operated because a cervical foraminal conflict. The patients were evaluated with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Neck Disability Index, and the Odom Scale. RESULTS The radicular pain because a cervical disc herniation was the predominant symptom. The most frequent affected level was C5-C6. The postoperative pain improvement was achieved in almost all the cases. The average preoperative VAS was 8.8 (8-10), with a marked postoperative improved in all the cases. The average preoperative Neck Disability Index was 35.3 (32-45), with a good postoperative improvement. The Odom Scale for the evaluation of a spine surgery was satisfactory, with an average of 1.17. Four patients (23%) showed postoperative complications: 3 superficial dehiscences, and one patient with a left C5 palsy; all the complications had a good recovery. CONCLUSION The posterior cervical foraminotomy is a good option for the treatment of a radicular pain caused by a foraminal conflict.</dc:description>
