<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective Identify barriers to implementation of the teleconsultation process in order to develop strategies to improve the program's operation. Methods A process evaluation strategy was used to study the implementation of the teleconsultation service. The program's operating manuals were compared with the qualitative and quantitative information compiled on the practical implementation of the teleconsultation process. Results The factors reported as obstacles to the teleconsultation process were: slow Internet connection, the hours available to the public, the specialized services offered, and insufficient clinical history included in teleconsultation requests. It was determined that 60% of internal medicine patients received two or more teleconsultations in the study period, as did 44% of patients of the gynecology service. Four consulting medical units accounted for 75% of the teleconsultations and the rest were distributed among 12 medical units. Conclusions The barriers identified in the teleconsultation process mainly affect consulting physicians; even so, productivity is on an upward trend. Despite the existing barriers, it was determined that some patients receive follow-up through the program, which favors access to care. It is necessary to standardize implementation and to conduct subsequent research on patients' health condition.</dc:description>
