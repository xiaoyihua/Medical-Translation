<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Stratification algorithms for acute coronary syndrome enable the identification of high-risk patients who will benefit from more aggressive treatment. The TIMI Risk Score (TRS) has been shown to be useful in intermediate- and high-risk patients. However, little is known about its value in non-selected patients. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of the TRS for risk stratification in a non-selected population with chest pain. PATIENTS AND METHOD We evaluated 1254 consecutive patients (age, 54 [19] years; 57% male) attending an emergency department for chest pain. Overall, 343 (27%) were admitted and 911 (73%) were discharged. All cardiac events during 6-month follow-up were recorded. RESULTS Of the 911 discharged patients, 45 (5.3%) were admitted during follow-up: 9 (1.1%) underwent revascularization, 5 (0.6%) had a myocardial infarction (MI), and 2 (0.2%) died from cardiovascular disease. Patients with a high TRS had a significantly higher risk of reaching the composite endpoint of death, MI, or revascularization (relative risk per unit of TRS increase, 3.63; 95% CI, 2.20-6.00; P &lt; .001). Of the patients who were initially admitted, 22 (6.4%) underwent revascularization, 4 (1.2%) had an MI, and 14 died (4.1%) from cardiovascular disease during follow-up. The relative risk of the composite endpoint per unit of TRS increase was 1.72 (95% CI, 1.32-2.24; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS The TIMI risk score is useful for stratifying cardiovascular event risk in non-selected patients with chest pain. The score can identify high-risk patients who will benefit from hospital admission and early aggressive treatment.</dc:description>
