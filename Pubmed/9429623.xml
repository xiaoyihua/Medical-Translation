<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to examine the effects of two levels of energy intakes and two levels of fat at breakfast, on the food and energy intakes in subsequent meal (lunch). The study was performed in 51 children both genders, with ages ranging from 24 to 48 months, attending a day care center. The children selected had normal nutritional status (weight/height index) according to the NCHS standards. The food intake was determined by differential weighing and energy intake was calculated from proximal analysis. The energy densities of the cow's milk formula used were 0.8 and 1.2 kcal/g, resulting in a total energy offer (breakfast) of 267.5 and 367.5 kcal respectively, the fat levels were 6.3 and 0.9 g/250 g of formula, using the design 2 x 2 factorial. In the study, 720 observations of food intake were conducted in those children consuming higher than 75% of the total food offered at breakfast. In the lunch-time were offered in alternated form two preparations with an 0.97 kcal/g of energy density. The results demonstrated that the children consumed significantly higher energy amounts in the subsequent meal, after being fed the high fat and lower energy-content breakfast. When the total energy intake (breakfast + lunch) was compared these results show that the caloric difference of breakfast was reduced and the degree of reduction was influenced by the fat level. These results show evidence for partial caloric compensation of 67% in the higher-fat level, and only 34% for the children with the lower of fat-level. It is conclude that the energy intake and fat intake at breakfast influences the energy intake at the subsequent meal. These findings are important to the preschool children's feeding with risk of malnutrition.</dc:description>
