<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The rate of readmission among asthmatic emergency patients varies. In 1991 we observed a 9% rate of readmission following emergency room release. Studies of the number of readmissions or request for medical care are used as the basis for recommendations for releasing patients from hospital emergency care. No studies have assessed disease stability following release or factors related to stability. OBJECTIVES To assess the course of disease and clinical stability of patients in the period immediately following release from emergency room care. To determine factors that might predict such stability. to determine the rate of readmission in the month following release after applying a treatment protocol and release criteria, with follow-up examination 72 h later. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective, descriptive study with follow-up 72 h and one month after release. SETTING Emergency and pneumology departments of a general hospital. PERIOD six months. PATIENTS 82 asthmatic patients released from the emergency room. RESULTS Two patients (2.43% were readmitted. At the first follow-up visit (72 h) 81 patients (98.78%) were seen. At the second visit, 66 patients (80.5%) were examined. We observed stability in 70.3% of patients at 72 h and in 86.4% after on month. Stability was statistically related to whether peak expiratory flow greater or less than 70% (76.92% stable versus 46.66% unstable) (p &lt; 0.05). No other clinical, epidemiological or treatment variables recorded upon release were found to influence stability. CONCLUSIONS 1) A large proportion of patients are in stable condition 72 h after release. 2) When peak expiratory flow upon release is &gt; 70%, stability is significantly increased 72 h later. 3) Our 2.43% rate of readmission one month after release is very low. 4) No differences in stability were seen to be related to oral corticoid prescription upon release.</dc:description>
