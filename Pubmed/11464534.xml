<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Sanitary and socioeconomic changes and the identification of new causative virus, have changed the epidemiology of hepatitis in Chile. AIM To study the natural history of acute hepatitis caused by virus A, E and non A-E in Chilean adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS A special study protocol was followed for patients with a clinical picture of acute hepatitis. Anti HAV IgM, anti HBc IgM, anti HEV IgG and IgM and Anti HCV antibodies were determined by ELISA. RESULTS Fifty nine patients (30 male), aged 15 to 58 years old were studied. Eighty nine percent had jaundice and 50 to 70% had malaise and abdominal pain. Virus A was positive in 80%, virus E in 7%. In 14% of patients, all viral markers were negative. The evolution was typical in 78%, biphasic in 14% and cholestatic in 5%. One patient had a prolonged and one a fulminant course. Mean ALT was 1148 U/l and mean total bilirubin was 5.5 mg/dl. Seventy three percent of cases occurred during early winter and spring and 27% during summer and early autumn. CONCLUSIONS The main etiology of acute viral hepatitis in Chile is virus A and most cases occur during the rainy season. Clinical features of hepatitis non A-E are similar to enteral transmission forms.</dc:description>
