<dc:description xml:lang="en">A serological survey was carried out in Osorno X Region, Chile (40 degrees 21'-40 degrees 46' South lat, and 73 degrees 26' -72 degrees-46' West long.). An indirect hemagglutination test (IHAT) for toxoplasmosis was performed to 305 persons--160 blood donors and 145 with sexually transmitted disease (STD). The age of the surveyed persons (167 males and 138 females) varied between 10 and 72 years. IHAT titers &gt; 16 were considered as positive. The general prevalence was 20.3%--21.2% in blood donors and 19.3% in persons with some STD--with no differences between males and females. However, significant differences between males and females with STD were found (35.6% and 8.1% respectively). No differences between urban and rural inhabitants were found with a slight higher prevalence in the urban ones. No antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii were detected in six AIDS patients. The importance of performing toxoplasmosis immunodiagnosis and individual prophylaxis to avoid the infection in high risk group are recommended.</dc:description>
