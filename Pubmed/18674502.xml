<dc:description xml:lang="en">Over 90% of digestive tract malignancies are adenocarcinomas (ADC) and almost 95% of them have gastric (G), colorectal (CR) or pancreatic (P) localizations. The objectives of this work are to review the genetic abnormalities of ADC in these locations and their potential coincidences, along with the histogenetic correlation of their emergence. Genetic abnormalities affecting over 50% of cases include: in G-ADC, inactivation of suppressor genes of p53, APC and DCC tumor in its intestinal variant, hypoexpression of of caderine E in the diffuse variant and hyperexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 and cyclyn D in the intestinal form; in in CR-ADC, inactivation of of genes p53, APC and DCC together with mutational activation of k-ras oncogen, and in P-ADC, the inactivation of suppressor genes p53, p16 and DPC4 along with mutational activation of k-ras oncogen. P-ADC is the one showing a more characteristic and exclusive genetic mark, followed by CR-ADC. Finally, the histogenetic correlation in the tumorigenic sequence is more evident in CR-ADC, followed by P-ADC. The complex biologic reality of G-ADC makes it more difficult to draw its genetic profile and its histogenetic correlation. In order to understand better the arguments of this work, the authors comment on the genetic-molecular basis governing the life and death of normal somatic cells and the biologic profile of the groups of genes mainly involved in tumorigenesis.</dc:description>
