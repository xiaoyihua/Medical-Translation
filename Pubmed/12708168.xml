<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this paper some reflections motivated by a prehispanic Olmec stone sculpture that was found in the Mexican state of Veracruz by 1940, are presented. This small figure of the prehispanic art, could be the representation, this is "a portrait", of a person with similar features to those present in patients with congenital hypothyroidism. This features include short stature, coarse face, eyelid edema and expression of the mental retardation, so this would be one more example of the acute clinical observation of ancient Mexicans and maybe a testimony of a continuous prevalence from remote times until nowadays of a defect that put a lot of human beings in great disadvantage, disability that has almost disappear thanks to neonatal screening.</dc:description>
