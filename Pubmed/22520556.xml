<dc:description xml:lang="en">Given the prevalence of low back pain, surgical interventions on the lumbar spine are becoming more common. Among the many surgical procedures available for these interventions, the most common are laminectomy and discectomy. In 10 to 40% of patients who undergo surgical interventions on the lumbar spine, low back pain is not completely alleviated or it recurs, and these cases fall into the category of « failed back surgery syndrome ». This syndrome can have many different causes and multiple factors are often involved. It is important not to confuse the normal postoperative findings with those specific to failed back surgery syndrome. Deciding which imaging technique to use will depend on the type of surgical intervention, whether metallic orthopedic material was used, and the clinical suspicion. It is essential to know the advantages and limitations of the available imaging techniques to ensure the optimal evaluation of these patients, especially after interventions carried out with instrumentation to minimize the artifacts due to these materials.</dc:description>
