<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The information concerning the currently existing healthcare registries in our country is not readily accessible, is scarce and some are not well-known, possibly being underused in comparison to their many potential uses. This study is aimed at evaluating the characteristics of the Spanish Healthcare registries and the utilization thereof, especially in Healthcare technology assessment. METHODS Descriptive, cross-sectional study of the Spanish Healthcare registries within the 1997-2002 period. These registries were identified by means ofa bibliographic databases search and by way of a survey of Scientific Societies and Central and Autonomic Healthcare Administration. Another bibliographic databases search was conducted of the publications which use data from the healthcare registries included and have been evaluated by applying the scientific evidence quality criteria. RESULTS A total of 107 healthcare registries were identified, most of which of local or regional coverage (71%), preferably were under Autonomic government authority (64.5%). The areas showing the largest number of registries identified were those related to death statistics (16.8%) and cancer (15.9%). A total of 298 publications were retrieved which analyze data produced by the registries identified, most of which are devoted to the study of the frequency and distribution of the events recorded (58.1%) and less frequently to the conducting of healthcare technology assessment studies (24.4%). CONCLUSIONS The critical evaluation of the publications made it possible to identify some elements related to the analysis methodology and design which would heighten the quality of the healthcare technology assessment. Healthcare registries in Spain have developed recently and to differing degrees. Important areas without any records and improvement elements related to the use of healthcare registries for healthcare technology assessment were detected. It would be advisable to avail of a register of registries which would provide relevant, up-dated information thereon.</dc:description>
