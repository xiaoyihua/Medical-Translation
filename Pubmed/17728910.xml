<dc:description xml:lang="en">On 17-19 May 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation held a meeting in Geneva: The Management of Birth Defects and Haemoglobin Disorders. Meeting participants included 18 experts from developing and industrialized countries, including the author and nine staff from WHO Headquarters. The meeting had five goals: (A) ratify the data on the global toll of birth defects presented in the MOD Global Report; (B) agree upon a definition of terms; (C) develop a collaborative plan for strengthening care and prevention of birth defects; (D) develop a plan for strengthening care and prevention of haemoglobin disorders; and (E) determine how potential stakeholders could contribute to these efforts. The consensus for each of the goals were: a) Participants endorsed the estimates in the MOD Global Report, b) Participants concluded that the term "birth defect" is synonymous with the term "congenital disorder", whereas the term "congenital anomalies" should be avoided, c) Participants agreed that 70% of birth defects could be prevented, ameliorated or treated effectively, by the strengthening of medical genetic services, d) Participants agreed that efforts must be made to improve the control of hemoglobin disorders in developing countries, and e) Progress will require the combined efforts and political will of the WHO.</dc:description>
