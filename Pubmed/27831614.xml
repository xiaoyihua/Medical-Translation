<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study explored the strategies for feeding preschool-aged children used by mothers in a marginal urban area of Lima. This qualitative, grounded theory method-based study included 30 mothers who participated in 1 of 4 focus group sessions and/or 1 of 11 in-depth interviews. Previously recorded in-depth interviews and focus groups were transcribed to identify the final issues. The mothers' ages ranged from 22 to 42 years, and 60% had not completed a basic education. The children's ages ranged from 36 to 66 months. The following positive strategies were identified: a) feeding when hungry and b) management of feeding opportunities. The following negative strategies were also identified: a) forcing a child to eat and b) use of punishment or reward to encourage complete food consumption. In conclusion, the mothers in our study cohort employed both positive and negative strategies to encourage food consumption in their children.</dc:description>
