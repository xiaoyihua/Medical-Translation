<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Degenerative diseases are becoming more frequent in adults due to the increase in the average life, among them osteoporosis is with one prevalence higher in women mainly due to the lack of estrogen after menopause. OBJECTIVE Estimate the prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia by effectuate a bone densitometry in postmenopausal women and analyze the possible relationship with some recognized risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cross-sectional study with 389 patients analyzing the following variables: age; index of body mass and time of treatment with hormone replacement therapy, crossing the information with the result of bone densitometry. RESULTS A prevalence rate similar to that reported in our country was obtained. We found that patients with overweight have one higher percentage of osteopenia and osteoporosis than normal weight, which is contrary to what was reported in literature. Also contrary to expectations, untreated patients occupy a higher percentage without bone disorders, while in the leading hormone therapy the lesser percentage was for those whit osteoporosis. We found no differences in terms of age. CONCLUSIONS Early diagnosis provides an excellent opportunity to address these problems but we must not forget that the best treatment is prevention from an early age.</dc:description>
