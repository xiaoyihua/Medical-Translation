<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Pelvic floor prolapse is a frequent condition in the woman, which in addition to anatomical alterations, may cause lower urinary tract dysfunction. We intend to verify the alterations of the micturation phase in patients with pelvic prolapse. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional cut off study was performed in a series of 102 women, mean age 66.8 years (standard deviation 9.6 years), diagnosed of urinary obstruction and pelvic prolapse and a prospective longitudinal study in a cohort of 21 patients of the previous series operated on for the prolapse. The patients were subjected to clinical examinations to determine the type and grade of public prolapse and to a urodynamic study. RESULTS A significant direct correlation was observed between the grade of cystocele and uterine prolapse and a significant correlation, but in inverse sense, between the grade of uterine prolapse and that of the enterocele. The patients with a greater grade of uterine prolapse had greater urethral resistance by the URA parameter. A tendency towards significance regarding the postsurgical variation of the Urethral Resistance Average (URA) that decreased after the surgery, and the W80-20 (detrusor contractility), that increased after it, was observed. CONCLUSIONS Pelvic prolapses affect the micturation phase. This involvement occurs both in the case of the cystoceles as well as in uterine prolapses and in the posterior compartments (rectocele and enterocele). Furthermore, an improvement is observed in the bladder contractility with the surgery of the pelvic prolapse.</dc:description>
