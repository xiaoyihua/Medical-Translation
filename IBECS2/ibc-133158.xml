<dc:title xml:lang="en">Maximal aerobic speed calculated by heart rate cost: relationship with performance</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objectives. To compare maximal aerobic speed (MAS) calculated by oxygen cost (vVO2max) and heart rate cost (vHRmax) with the direct measurement of MAS (Vpeak) and to verify the relationship between vHRmax and 10&amp;#8208; and 15&amp;#8208;km performance in middle&amp;#8208;age recreationally runners. Method. Twenty one recreationally runners participated in this study (age: 30 to 49 years), allocated in two groups according to age (G1 and G2). Participants were submitted to an incremental continuous test of maximal effort in laboratory to determine maximal oxygen uptake. MAS was determined according to proposes presented in literature based on vVO2max and vHRmax. Besides, it was performed two performances in field track (10 and 15 km). Results. The lowest difference between the mean values observed and Vpeak was in relation to vHRmax from Lacour et al. (0.0 km h&#150;1; p &gt; 0.05). The highest was in relation to vHRmax from di Prampero (1.55 km h&#150;1; p &lt; 0.05). The same pattern of differences was observed when G1 and G2 were analyzed. The vHRmax determined according to two different methods presented in literature showed to be correlated with 10 and 15 km performances (0.55 &amp;#8804; r &amp;#8804; 0.82; p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions. The vHRmax in middle&amp;#8208;aged recreational runners has elevated correlation with 10 and 15 km performances and was not different from Vpeak (to vHRmax from Lacour et al.) showing similar results than the method based on oxygen cost (AU)</dc:description>
