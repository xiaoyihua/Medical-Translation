<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the medium-term outcome of en bloc transplantation of pediatric kidneys into adult patients, including the incidence and type of surgical complications. METHODS From November 1991 to December 1997, we performed 37 en bloc transplantation of pediatric kidneys into adult patients. The kidneys were harvested from donors less that 3 years old and/or weighing 15 kg. The mean follow-up was 24 months. Grafting was achieved by end-to-side anastomosis of the donor cava to the receptor external iliac and the aortic patch to the external iliac artery. RESULTS Three grafts failed, probably due to hilar torsion; the remaining were initially functioning well. Seven transplant removal were performed; 6 were due to thrombosis. The actuarial graft survival was 89.1% at one month, 80.83% at 12 months and 80.83% at 24 months. CONCLUSIONS The medium-term results of en bloc transplantation of pediatric kidneys into adult patients were excellent and demonstrate the efficacy of this type of grafts. Arterial and venous thrombosis were the most important complications, quantitatively and qualitatively.</dc:description>
