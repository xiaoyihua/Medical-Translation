<dc:description xml:lang="en">A general view is given of the accreditation of education programs and the certification of laboratory and radiology technicians and of members of the health professions in general. In addition, the functions of the federal government and the professional societies are described in a organizational chart, and the work done by each group participating in the accreditation and certification process is explained. Although a structured academic education is ordinarily required for certification, the agencies charged with it offer different possibilities in which a limited number of academic requirements may be replaced by clinical experience or experience in the field in question. Also included are the requirements for admission to written examinations for certification in laboratory and radiology technology in the United States. Special attention is given to the interconnection between accreditation and certification in those two professional fields.</dc:description>
