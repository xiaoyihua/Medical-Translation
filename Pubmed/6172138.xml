<dc:description xml:lang="en">The somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded (SEP) in a child 11 years old with congenital insensitivity to pain. The records were made before and after naloxone administration (160 mg i.m.) and they were compared with the SEPs from normal children. The place where records were taken was the somatosensory area of the scalp and the site of the stimulation was the contralateral medial nerve of the wrist. The results show that naloxone provokes higher waves of the patient's SEP that before administration of naloxone. On the other hand lower SEPs were observed in the patient with congenital insensitivity to pain than in those from normal children. The results suggest that congenital insensitivity to pain could be related to abnormal activities of morphine-like substances of endogenous production.</dc:description>
