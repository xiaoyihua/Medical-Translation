<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Guillain-Barré Syndrome is an acute immune-mediated inflammatory polyneuropathy characterized by flaccid paresia with arreflexia, changeable sensitive disorder and albuminocytologic dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of 30 GBS patients diagnosed in Hospital Clínico de Zaragoza between 1999 and 2005. Annual incidence, seasonal distribution, preceding acute infection; clinical, electrophysiological and electrocardiographic (ECG) data and evolution were all evaluated. RESULTS The incidence was 1.56/100000 inhabitants/year. We observed an upward tendency during winter months. The rates of incidence were higher in men (66.7%) and increased with age in both sexes. Main clinical presentation form was paraparesia of lower limbs followed on cranial nerve palsy. Immunoglobulin therapy was received by 62.5% of patients. The rate of death was 10%. Thirteen per cent of patients had dysautonomia. Electrocardiographic abnormalities were present in 37% of patients. CONCLUSIONS GBS incidence in Aragon Country is similar to that found in other studies. An increase with age and an upward tendency during the winter months was observed. High percentage of abnormalities in ECG but the majority of patients was asymptomatic.</dc:description>
