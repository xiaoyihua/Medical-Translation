<dc:description xml:lang="en">Smoking is difficult to treat, since addiction to tobacco is very strong and a deprivation syndrome may follow cessation of nicotine consumption. The ultimate goal of treatment is smoking cessation. Anti-smoking counseling and self teaching manuals are used as public health strategies, while nicotine chewing gum, clonidine, hypnosis, acupuncture and negative conditioning are individual strategies. Success rates in treatment of smoking vary between 5 and 40% at 1 to 2 years. Individualized therapy including care for the smoker as a person, family and labor support are needed to increase the chance of success.</dc:description>
