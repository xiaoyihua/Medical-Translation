<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study is to carry out an analysis of peer acceptance and peer rejection from a contextual perspective, taking into account the different settings in which social relationships develop. A sociometric questionnaire was used that combined the nomination method for different interaction contexts (academic and leisure) with the method of allocation of perceptive attributes. The sample is made up of 777 pupils ranging from the 4th year of primary school to 2nd year of secondary. The main results indicate that acceptance and rejection are influenced by interpersonal contexts. So, whereas peer acceptance is identified with the academic context, peer rejection has a cross-contextual connotation. The percentages of the diverse kinds of acceptance and rejection do not vary among the school courses studied. Some behavioural characteristics that differentiate the kinds of students who are preferred and rejected are identified. In conclusion, contextualised sociometric analyses should be carried out, as social relationships -and therefore, sociometric status- vary depending on the setting in which they take place.</dc:description>
