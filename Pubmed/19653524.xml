<dc:description xml:lang="en">At present times, pain, either acute or chronic, has acquired great relevance at a health level and a socio-economic level. Pain is one of those universally recognized symptoms which, with great frequency causes a patient to consult his general practitioner; approximately two out of every three patients do so. Despite the availability of the most advanced treatments, the reality is that approximately one of every five adult Europeans suffers long-lasting pain, according to the study Pain in Europe. This is a subjective experience, one difficult to measure or quantify but one having great interest regarding which therapy should be applied as well as its effectiveness.</dc:description>
