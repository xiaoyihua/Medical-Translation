<dc:description xml:lang="en">The quality of the nursing care affects greatly the success of the heart transplant. This is the reason why we considered of great interest to review the care planning established in the ICU of the University Clinic for these patients and to assess the incidence of complications detected during the immediate post-operatory. On the whole, the care planning is similar to the one used with patients who undergo heart surgery under extracorporal circulation, emphasizing the surveillance and maintainance of heart function, administering of immunosuppression drugs, prophylaxis of the infection and psychological care. 29 patients with an average age of 58.6 years who underwent heart transplant were studied retrospectively. The collection of data was performed using nursing and clinical records, which allowed us to analyse the evolution of the different corporal functions such as respiratory, cardiovascular, etc., and those aspects related to rejection, infection, welfare and comfort. Observing the results obtained, the incidence of complications was low. Evolution of heart function was correct in 96% of cases, there were no clinical signs of pulmonar, urinal, or vascular catheters infection in any cases. Psychic alterations and sleeping disorders were recorded in 24% of patients. We conclude that the care planning, although it could be improved, can be considered adequate.</dc:description>
