<dc:description xml:lang="en">Besides the organic disease, there is another emotional disease and also another latent social disease in an ill person and in his/her environment. This emotional disease is determined by the psychological stress caused in the persons suffering a disease and in his/her relatives. To that disease, often a social disease is added. This last disease is driven by one becoming stigmatized, and at times a self-stigmatic process in the patient himself/herself, which tends to isolate a patient in his/her closest surroundings and to make him/her a recluse inside his/her house which leads to a suspension of social relationships.</dc:description>
