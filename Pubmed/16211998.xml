<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED In general experienced hands, the inferior parathyroid glands, localized in the thymus or low extrathymus are the main cause or surgical therapeutic failure. When they could not be approached through cervicotomy, or when they were diagnosed after surgery the sternotomy or the angiographic ablation were chosen as treatment. The limited number of thoracoscopic approach whit good results published so far, moved us to use this method. MATERIAL AND METHOD Patient of 49 years with a 7 year secondary hiperprathyroidism due to CRI. After a sub total parathyroidectomy with bilateral thimectomy, the patient did not present clinical or laboratory improvement. Through a thoracic centellogram sixth MIBI, NMR and CAT, a tumor in the middle mediastinum was fond. The mediastinal structures have been easily identified through a left thoracoscopic approach. At the level of the aortopulmonary window, a tumoral mass is located and, with a simple dissection, et is easily extracted in bag. The biopsy through freezing confirms the parathyroid etiology of the gland. RESULT Clinical and laboratory evolution has been favorable, with hospital discharged at the 3 day, and being asymptomatic after two years. CONCLUSION The hipersecretant parathyroid glands, located in middle mediastinum, that can not be approach through cervicotomy, can be successfully approach through thoracoscopic technique.</dc:description>
