<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Although the genetic component in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is well established, some environmental factors, mainly dietary, can favor its development. The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between daily consumption of specific food groups and development of CRC. METHODS We carried out a case-control study in an area of Madrid; 196 patients with diagnosis of CRC with confirmed histology and registered to May 1998 in the Community of Madrid tumor register were included, and they were compared with 196 controls matched by age, sex, and geographical area. All of them filled out a questionnaire with information on diet, substance abuse, physical activity, drugs, and family history of CRC. RESULTS The logistic regression analysis showed a weakly positive association with meat (OR: 1.02; CI: 1.01-1.04), viscera (OR: 1.12; CI: 1.02-1.23), and sausage (OR: 1.07; CI: 1.03-1.1) consumption, and a modest inverse association with consumption of yogurt (OR: 0.97; CI: 0.95-0.98), tomato (OR: 0.99; CI: 0.98-0.99), strawberries and cherries (OR: 0.97; CI: 0.95-0.99), oranges, grapefruits, and natural fruit juices (OR: 0.99; CI: 0.98-1). CONCLUSIONS These results are an additional empirical evidence that must be confirmed through prospective studies.</dc:description>
