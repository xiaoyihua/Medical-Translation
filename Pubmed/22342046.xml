<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To identify the factors associated with functional status in a population aged ≥ 75 years without severe dependence. METHODS A cross-sectional study of a random sample (n = 315) of elderly persons in a primary care setting (El Remei Primary Care Center, Vic, Barcelona, Spain) was carried out. Functional status was evaluated by three physical performance tests: the Guralnik chair stand test of lower limb function, Lawton-Brody's index of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and the Barthel index of basic activities of daily living (BADL). A backward multiple linear regression model was used to analyze the association of sociodemographic and clinical variables with functional status. RESULTS The mean age was 81.9 years and 60.6% were female. Around 50% of elderly patients without total dependence showed disability for IADL and a third showed lower limb functional limitation. The variables associated with lower limb functional status were marital status, body mass index, number of drugs, and vision and hearing impairment (R(2) = 0.208). The variables associated with IADL were age, cognitive impairment, vision and hearing impairment, and lower limb functional limitation (R(2) = 0.434). The variables associated with the Barthel index were age, sex, poor self-perceived health, and lower limb functional limitation (R(2) = 0.389). CONCLUSIONS The risk factors associated with functional status in our population ≥ 75 years of age without severe dependence were the number of drugs and sensory impairment.</dc:description>
