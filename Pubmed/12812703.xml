<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Our objective was to evaluate, through the health related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire MINICHAL, the influence of socio-demographic, clinical and therapeutic variables on health related quality of life of hypertensive patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD An observational, prospective and multi-center study was carried out in hypertensive patients who were either starting or undergoing a modification of antihypertensive treatment. A total of three visits was done: a baseline visit and two follow-up visits at one and six months. At all three visits, several socio-demographic, clinical and therapeutic variables were recorded and HRQoL was measured using the MINICHAL questionnaire, the Spanish version of the Psychological General Well-Being Index, and a single question about the change in general health status. The objective was to evaluate the impact of these variables on HRQoL. RESULTS 736 patients with hypertension were evaluated. In the multivariate analysis, gender, number of concomitant diseases, degree of hypertension, organ damage and educational level were all variables displaying a relation with HRQoL. After 6 months of treatment intensification, an improvement of HRQoL was observed. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between the degree of reduction of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate and HRQoL improvement, especially in the State of mind dimension. CONCLUSIONS In hypertension, a better BP control has a positive influence on HRQoL. As several clinical variables are negatively correlated with HRQoL, specific interventions are needed to correct modifiable factors.</dc:description>
