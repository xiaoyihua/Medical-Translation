<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since uricosuria is an essential compensative factor in hyperuricemia, multiple factors exist which can influence on the uric acid excretion in the tubules. Normally, 90% of the uric acid filtered by the glomerulus is reabsorbed, and its active tubular secretion forms the greater part of the uric acid present in the urine. One of the factors observed as leading to urinary excretion of uric acid, is saline overload, although this effect cannot always be achieved. This study is an attempt to assess the importance of hyperuricemia as a determinant of the action of sodium upon the urinary excretion of uric acid. The series were grouped according to the plasma and urinary values of uric acid. In cases studied, the percentage of sodium was similar independent of the excretion percentages obtained for uric acid. Nevertheless, in the groups with increased plasma levels of uric acid, a direct and significant correlation was found between the excretion percentage of sodium and that of uric acid. These data cannot be obtained in groups with normal plasma levels of uric acid. Since saline overload does not always lead to hyperuricosuria, other factors must condition the secondary effect. The obtained results suggest that hyperuricemia can be one of those factors, offering a great amount of uric acid to the renal tubule, a condition in which the sodium may act as a dragging factor which may not be possible with a lesser degree of uric acid.</dc:description>
