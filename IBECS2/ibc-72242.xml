<dc:description xml:lang="es">Most of the data available to date of the influence of nutrients on the cognitive function suggests that some macro- and micronutrients may have a preventive effect on the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases. Since most of the studies have been performed in animals, the limitations that ensue when translating the results to the human being are controversial with regards to the recommendations that must be applied in the usual clinical practice. The lack of information on nutrients and their role in current therapy for neurological diseases make the clinicians reluctant to use specific nutrients for particular pathologies. The identification of the optimal dose of single nutrients is something to be considered when designing the clinical trials with large groups of subjects and it may be a guide for large-scale research projects. The generalized hypothesis stating that by improving the diet we may modulate or delay the progression of the cognitive impairment is becoming more and more powerful, and trying to delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases is becoming a public health issue. The pharmacotherapy of the neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&#146;s disease or Parkinson&#146;s disease, yields modest outcomes on cognitive function improvement, and its effects on the disease progression are virtually absent or imperceptible however, very little benefits in this regard may be significant and important for the quality of life of both the patients and their caregivers. The emergence of new antioxidants that may modulate or delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, with new mechanisms of action and new administration systems to the patients are challenges for the future. The great variety of tests used in clinical trials to measure different cognitive areas makes very difficult the assessment of the outcomes and the comparison between the different studies so that drawing conclusions for the daily clinical practice may be somewhat speculative. Using standard tests that have been validated in the clinical practice for certain areas of the cognitive function would be the best way of obtaining valid and applicable conclusions in the future (AU)</dc:description>
