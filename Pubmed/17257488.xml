<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Given the high prevalence in Mexico, neurocysticercosis is frequently associated with all varieties of brain lesions. However, the clinical association between pituitary adenoma and suprasellar cysts is unknown. There are no case reports elsewhere in the literature. CLINICAL CASE A 42-year-old female presented to the hospital complaining of increased headache and right-sided temporal hemianopsia. Imaging studies including CT and MRI revealed a moderate size pituitary adenoma along with multiple cysts located in the subarachnoid cisterns in the Sylvian fissure and around the suprasellar cistern. The patient subsequently underwent surgical exploration by means of a right frontotemporal craniotomy with pituitary adenoma resection and cyst removal. The histopathological exam was consistent with non-functioning pituitary adenoma and racemosus cysticercosis. CONCLUSIONS There are no reports of a clinical association between pituitary adenoma and racemosus cysticercosis. A high suspicion index is indicated in order to avoid misdiagnoses.</dc:description>
