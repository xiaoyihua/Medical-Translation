<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In Chile, less than 30% of treated hypertensive patients achieve normal blood pressure values. Lack of compliance with treatment may influence the lack of success of treatments. AIM To identify determinant treatment compliance factors, according to the Health Belief Model, in elderly hypertensive patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A stratified and randomized sample with 245 elderly hypertensive patients, participating in the Cardiovascular Program of the San Pedro de la Paz Health Center in Chile, was studied. Modified Miller's Health Behavior Scale to measure therapeutic compliance and Health Belief Questionnaire to measure independent factors influencing compliance, were applied. Data analysis was done with Student's, test ANOVA and linear regression. RESULTS Eight of 23 factors were predictors of compliance: gender, occupational activity, smoking, modification of health behaviors, difficulties to take medications, perception of treatment effectiveness, knowledge and perception about hypertension. CONCLUSIONS Knowledge about factors that influence therapeutic compliance allows to modify health care programs and improve their effectiveness.</dc:description>
