<dc:description xml:lang="en">Unconventional Medicine (UM) spans a variegated group of diagnostic an therapeutic procedures in growing use most of which supplement those of Conventional Medicine (CM). Few such procedures, however, have a solid scientific foundation; rather, they rely heavily on the healing ability of the physician and placebo, which they exploit through the doctor-patient liaison. For doctrinal and procedural reasons, the two types of medicine are following an integrating path. The practice of UM requires appropriate regulation. The process, which is anticipated to meet with many difficulties, may be easier to complete if institutions such as the Royal Academies of Medicine are engaged in the effort.</dc:description>
