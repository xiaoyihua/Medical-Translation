<dc:description xml:lang="en">Pituicytomas are rare entities which develop in the neurohypophysis. They were included in the last World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Central Nervous System Tumours in 2007, but for many years they have been confused with other pituitary tumours. We report the case of a 31-year-old woman who was diagnosed of a tumour in the suprasellar region during an infertility study due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and slight hyperprolactinemia. A standard pterional approach was performed, achieving total tumour excision. After the surgery the patient suffered bitemporal hemianopsia, diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism, although she recovered from the latter 2 in a few weeks. We conducted a review of the most common clinical and radiological features of this entity, as well as the treatments proposed in the literature to treat this rare tumour.</dc:description>
