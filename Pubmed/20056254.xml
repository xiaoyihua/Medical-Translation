<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE To evaluate prospectively the association between dietary fat intake and the incidence of cataracts in participants from the SUN cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS Among 12308 men and women, initially free of cataracts and followed-up for up to 6 years, we identified 182 incident cases of cataracts. Fatty acids intake was assessed by a validated 136-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Socio-demographic and anthropometric characteristics, lifestyle, health-related habits and information about medical conditions were also collected. Incident cases of cataract were ascertained by self-reports using a biennale questionnaire. RESULTS Participants belonging to the highest category of omega-6 fatty acids intake had a non-significantly reduced risk of cataracts in the model adjusted for potential confounders but not for other fatty acids (adjusted OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.33, 1.03). When all types of fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated omega-6 and polyunsaturated omega-3) were included simultaneously in the same multivariable model, this inverse association became significant (adjusted OR: 0.54 95%CI: 0.29, 0.99). There were no significant associations between other dietary fats and the risk of cataracts. CONCLUSION High intake of omega-6 fatty acids showed a modest but significant inverse association with the development of cataracts.</dc:description>
