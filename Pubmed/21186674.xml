<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of the study was to evaluate the susceptibility to old and new antimicrobial agents against hospital-acquired oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-ORSA), community-acquired oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-ORSA), and oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus(OSSA). The minimum inhibitory concentration of different antimicrobial agents against 118 S. aureus consecutive and prospective isolates was studied by the CLSI agar dilution method. In ORSA isolates without accompanying resistance, the mecA gene, the Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene (PVL), and the gamma-hemolysin gene were determined by PCR, and the SCC cassette mec gene by multiplex PCR. Out of the 118 isolates, 44 were HA-ORSA, 16 were CA-ORSA, and 58 corresponded to OSSA. The HA-ORSA isolates presented simultaneous resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin whereas all of them were susceptible to tigecycline (TIG), vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid (LZD). The CA-ORSA isolates were only resistant to OXA and presented susceptibility to all the antimicrobial agents assayed. In all of them, the mec-A gene, the PVL gene, the gamma-hemolysin gene and the SCC cassette mec type IV gene were detected. With the OSSA and CA-ORSA isolates, all the non-beta-lactam antimicrobial agents assayed exhibited excellent in vitro activity. However, in the HA-ORSA isolates, only the old antimicrobial agents such as glycopeptides, doxyciclin, rifampin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and the new antimicrobial agents LZD and TIG, presented good in vitro activity. The ORSA phenotype without accompanying resistance was highly predictive of CA-ORSA as confirmed by a positive SCC cassette mec type IV.</dc:description>
