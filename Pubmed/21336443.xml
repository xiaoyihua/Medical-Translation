<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between the anthropometric nutritional state of the pregnant women during his third trimester of pregnancy with the anthropometric state nutritional of the product of the gestation, who carried out their prenatal control in the University Hospital of Caracas and the Hospital of Caracas Clinics. The evaluated variables were: pregestational weight, gestational weight, chart, average circumference of the arm and fold of triceps; the anthropometric indicators were constructed: index of corporal mass (IMC) pregestational and gestational and of corporal composition such as greasy and muscular area of the arm. In new born, one evaluated the weight and the stature and so the ponderal index was constructed (IP), as well as the clinical evaluation of the nutritional state of the newborn one (ECEN). Statistical Package SPSS 13,0 for Windows, calculating statistical descriptive basic and coefficient of correlation of Pearson was used (p 0.05). The results indicate that when considering the associations between the maternal variables and anthropometric indicators with the neonatal ones is to a great extent positive correlation, of this form, cases as the average circumference of arm (CMB) maternal were statistically significant with the ponderal index and puntaje ECEN, indicating that the maternal CMB is constituted like an indicative variable of the nutritional state of the newborn one. The early incorporation in the routine monitoring of the prenatal control, the anthropometric valuation with effective simple variables of low cost is recommended and, being able to detect nutritional alterations in which it is found opportunely to prevent adverse results in the newborn one.</dc:description>
