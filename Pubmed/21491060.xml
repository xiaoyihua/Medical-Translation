<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to evaluate an indirect specific ELISA developed for the detection of humoral immune response in vaccinated sheep and/or challenged with a Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis strain. Healthy 4 month-old lambs were distributed into 4 groups: Group 1 immunized (G1, n = 5), Group 2 vaccinated/inoculated (G2, n = 8), Group 3 inoculated (G3, n = 2) and Group 4 control (G4, n = 2). Groups G1 and G2 received two doses of an experimental bacterin. Four weeks postvaccination, G2 and G3 groups were challenged with a C. pseudotuberculosis strain. Serological titers were studied by ELISA for 7 months and pathological studies were performed in groups G2, G3 and G4 by taking lung and lymph node samples for bacteriology and histopathology. The inoculated strain in G2 and G3 animals reproduced the macroscopic and microscopic lesions typical of caseous lymphadenitis (CL) and was isolated from the inoculation site, lymph nodes and/or lung in 7/8 animals from G2, and 2/2 animals of G3. The developed ELISA test had sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 100% respectively, detected significant differences between serological reactors of different experimental groups and allowed to establish a relationship with the type of treatment. We conclude that the developed ELISA may be a useful tool to identify infected animals with positive clinical CL.</dc:description>
