<dc:description xml:lang="en">Knowledge about celiac disease continues to grow and amaze those who investigate, seek and treat this condition. Gone are the days when it was considered just a rare child's digestive disease. It is now recognized as a highly prevalent autoimmune condition that affects children and adults with digestive and extra-digestive symptoms of diverse intensity, disorder that may be either mono, oligo or asymptomatic from a digestive point of view. Today, it is an underdiagnosed condition, not actively considered, and often mistakes are made regarding its diagnosis, treatment and gluten-free diet monitoring. This article reviews the current definition of the disease, clinical presentations, potential patients, how to search for the disease, how the diagnosis is made and characteristics of the treatment and monitoring of celiac patients, all based on internationally agreed standards, and emphasizing those aspects that have proven to be useful in other countries regarding the management of the disease.</dc:description>
