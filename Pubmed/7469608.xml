<dc:description xml:lang="en">25 patients with ischemic heart disease were studied by selective coronariography and radiocoronariograpy with 3mCi of human albumin macroaggregates labeled with 99mTc, injected selectively into each coronary artery. Gammagraphic images were then obtained. 17 cases (68%), had coronary obstructions and 8 patients (32%), had a normal coronary angiogram. Of all patients studied, 23 (92%), had areas of hypoperfusion. Patients with coronary obstructions had corresponding image defects. 6 cases with normal coronary angiography had areas of hypoperfusion and finally 2 cases had normal images in both studies. All patients wit EC6 necrosis had abnormal radiocoronariography. The macrocirculation is studied by coronary angiography, while the microcirculation is visualized by radiocoronariography. Both technique are complementary. We conclude that radiocoronariography should be performed routinely after coronary angiography in the study of ischemic heart disease, with special emphasis in cases with normal angiograms.</dc:description>
