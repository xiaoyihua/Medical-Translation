<dc:description xml:lang="en">A 69-year-old woman, with an aortic replacement valve for rheumatic aortic insufficiency suffered a sudden cardiac tamponade caused by a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta which had its origin in the suture of the aorta performed 10 years earlier. The cardiac tamponade presented as syncope, absent central pulse, and respiratory failure. Hemodynamic variables recovered with early detection and start of cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers. After fluids were replaced and following catecholamine treatment, a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a pseudoaneurysm and continuous flow between the aorta and the right ventricle. The aneurysm and an unusual right ventricular fistula were repaired surgically through an emergency exploratory sternotomy. Cardiovascular recovery was satisfactory although hospital discharge was delayed because of pulmonary complications leading to severe hypoxia, pleural effusion, and pneumonia, with tracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp, and Aspergillus flavus. We stress that immediate start of cardiopulmonary resuscitation prevented multiorgan failure and allowed for satisfactory recovery from surgery in spite of the presence of risk factors for mortality.</dc:description>
