<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES We attempted to determine whether or not incidental renal cell carcinoma had a better prognosis. METHODS We reviewed 53 cases of renal cell carcinoma that had been surgically treated over the periods 1985-1988 and 1989-1993. The form of presentation, stage of the incidental tumors, sex, compromised side and the diagnostic imaging technique utilized were analyzed. RESULTS GI pathology most frequently led to the diagnosis of the tumor. Tumor stages were A or B with a slightly higher prevalence for the incidental tumors. However, the prognosis was not better than that of clinically suspected renal cell carcinoma. The male to female ratio was 1.17:1, the mean age was 63 years, the tumors were frequently right-sided and ultrasound was superior in the diagnosis of incidental tumors. CONCLUSIONS No prognostic difference was observed between clinically suspected and incidental renal cell carcinoma of the same tumor stage.</dc:description>
