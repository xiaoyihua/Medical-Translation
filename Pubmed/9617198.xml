<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine changes in the nutritional status of Guatemalan refugee children under six years of age, who lived in Mexico between 1982 and 1996, under various nutrition-related programs implemented during that period. MATERIAL AND METHODS A comparative analysis of 4 cross-sectional anthropometric studies performed in Chiapas (1982, 1989), Quintana Roo (1989) and Campeche and Quintana Roo in 1996. Malnutrition prevalence by weight/age and height/age indicators was calculated. Odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. The implemented programs to improve nutritional status and health conditions are described. RESULTS In 1982, high rates of malnutrition and mortality prevailed among refugee children. In 1989 some had been transferred to Campeche and Quintana Roo and others stayed in Chiapas. Their situation had improved and remained so until 1996. CONCLUSIONS The implemented programs were successful to control the emergency and prevent new crises. However they only managed to maintain similar conditions for the refugees as those which prevail among the Mexican indians.</dc:description>
