<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Report the experience of the authors with the treatment of degenerative disc disease using minimally-invasive circumferential arthrodesis and considering the functional results, healing and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS Circumferential arthrodesis was performed with an anterior approach using an interbody spacer, and with a posterior approach using translaminar facet screws in 36 patients. All of them had disc degeneration with some type of contraindication for lumbar arthroplasty, with a history of conservative treatment for at least 6 months. They were evaluated before and after surgery with the visual analogue pain scale and the Oswestry scale, as well as a treatment satisfaction scale (0 to 10 points). RESULTS The pain scale went from 9.1 preoperatively to 23 postoperatively, and the Oswestry disability scale went from 47% to 21%. The satisfaction rate at the two-year follow-up was 9.2. All patients were found to have interbody healing at the 6-month follow-up and there were 2 complications: one vascular injury and one case of transient retrograde ejaculation. CONCLUSION Circumferential arthrodesis using minimally-invasive methods leads to interbody healing and good functional recovery rates and low complication rates.</dc:description>
