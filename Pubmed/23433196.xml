<dc:description xml:lang="en">CASE REPORT A 73 year-old woman with epiphora and ocular irritation resistant to medical treatment. The lacrimal pathway was permeable and there was no eyelid malposition. On examining the patient with her glasses on, both lower eyelids presented an inner third ectropion. Once the diagnosis was established and the mechanical factor resolved, the clinical symptoms improved within a few days. DISCUSSION The diagnosis of the eyelid ectropion can be more complex when the ectropion is secondary to wearing glasses. The presence of the epicanthic fold shows the importance of the mechanical factor. In our patient the characteristics of the ectropion were similar to the so-called centurion syndrome.</dc:description>
