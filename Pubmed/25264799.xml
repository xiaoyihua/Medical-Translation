<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Pressure ulcers are a dominant health problem for people who, for various reasons, must spend most of their time in a seated position. The spinal cord injury patients are the most affected for this situation. One strategy to prevent pressure ulcers is throughthe use of special seats. In the Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitación, contoured special seats have been developed according to anatomical measure of spinal cord injured patients. OBJECTIVE To find one or more combinations of test materials that reduced pressure below 60 mmHg, in the ischial area, in order to help to prevent pressure ulcers. MATERIAL AND METHODS The special seats were fabricated using thermoplastic materials and polyurethane foams, following prosthetic fitting technique; and were tests in healthy volunteers. RESULTS The results were compared with a vinyl seat, because most of wheelchairs have it. All different test combinations were superior to vinyl seat, specially the two polyurethane foam- polypropylene combinations. A group of nine patients with spinal cord injury were recruited to test the designed seats, for a three month period. DISCUSSION The results showed that pressure values are lower in the special seats than in the vinyl seats. No complications or pressure ulcers were found during follow up.</dc:description>
