<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The aim of the study was to evaluate three different methods for calculating the split renal function in patients with only one functioning kidney, keeping in mind that the split function should be zero on the side of the non-functioning kidney. PATIENTS We retrospectively selected 28 99mTc MAG3 renograms performed in children, 12 with unilateral nephrectomy, 4 with unilateral agenesis and 12 with a non-functioning kidney. METHODS A renal and perirenal region of interest (ROI) were delineated around the functioning kidney. The ROIs around the empty kidney were drawn symmetrically to the contralateral side. The split renal function was calculated using three different methods, the integral method, the slope method and the Patlak-Rutland algorithm. RESULTS For the whole group of 28 kidneys as well as for the three categories of patients, the three methods provided a split function on the side of the non-functioning kidney close to the zero value, regardless of whether the empty kidney was the left or the right one. CONCLUSION We recommend the use of the integral method for the whole range of split renal function with 99mTc MAG3. No significant improvement was obtained by means of the more sophisticated Patlak-Rutland method.</dc:description>
