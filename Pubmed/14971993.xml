<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To study the usefulness and safety of capsule endoscopy as a diagnostic tool in various small bowel disorders. DESIGN A retrospective analysis of a series of cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between August 2001 and August 2002, 92 capsule endoscopy procedures were performed in 88 patients (53M/39F, age: 43.87 +/- 16.78). Indications included: chronic diarrhea (n=33); unknown abdominal pain (n=29); occult gastrointestinal bleeding or iron-deficiency anemia (n=13); abdominal discomfort in NSAID takers (n=7); staging of gastrointestinal tumors (n=4), and asymptomatic controls (n=2). Previously performed gastroscopy, colonoscopy, and small-bowel follow-through were not conclusive in all patients. RESULTS Most frequently relevant findings included: jejuno-ileal aphtas and ulcerations (29 patients), vascular malformations (13 patients), and intestinal neoplasm (6 patients). The groups with a higher rate of findings related to this indication were occult gastrointestinal bleeding (76.92%) and chronic diarrhea (67.85%), with the lowest rate in the abdominal pain group (34.48%). Therapeutic strategy was directly changed in 36 of 88 patients (40.90%) because of capsule-endoscopic findings. The only observed complication was the failed excretion of one of the capsules because of an unknown ulcerated intestinal stricture. CONCLUSIONS Capsule endoscopy is a safe procedure which can study the entire small bowel, meaning a valuable tool for the management of patients with suggestive signs and symptoms of intestinal disorders.</dc:description>
