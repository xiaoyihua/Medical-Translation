<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the present paper, we comment on the psychological and emotional disorders occurring after surgery. We surveyed 150 children that were admitted in several surgical units of our Children's Hospital. We used the Vernon's test in a questionaire. We reached a high level of comprehension. As a result, 121 valid questionaires were returned. The considerable amount of information was statistically studied with a computer, obtaining data on the following aspects: Filiation, frequency and percentage of every answer. Post-hospitalization behaviour evaluated by Vernon's test. Partial and total results under the 6 factors of the questionaire: General anxiety and regression, anxiety about separation, anxiety about sleeping, eating disturbances, agressiveness against authority, apathy and isolation. Previous results in connection with the diverse filiation variables. When we analyzed the results, we confirmed the findings of other investigators: A global damage in child behaviour, that is present in two main aspects: "Anxiety about separation" and "Agressiveness against authority". In conclusion, our results support the need for implementing prophylactic measures, of which "psychological presentation" is the most important, to children that are going to be operated upon.</dc:description>
