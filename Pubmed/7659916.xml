<dc:description xml:lang="en">In eight patients with chronic and stable psoriasis, the usefulness of topical cyclosporine solution using 50% dimethylsulfoxide as a vehicle was assessed in a randomly chosen plate and compared with a similar solution without cyclosporine in a contralateral plate. After six months of treatment, the plates involuted in two patients, and in the rest there was a 1 to 3 points reduction in the local psoriasis area severity index score. Plasma cyclosporine levels were negligible and no changes in blood chemistry were detected. It is concluded that topical cyclosporine is effective in the treatment of psoriasis, but only after a prolonged application period.</dc:description>
