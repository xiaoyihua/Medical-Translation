<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse the distribution of the extrapulmonary forms of presentation of tuberculosis (EFP) in our health district. MATERIALS AND METHODS The medical records of patients diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis attending the Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Unit of the Santiago Health District were reviewed over a three years period. The classification of EFP was: extrapulmonary forms (EF), disease outside the lung; mixed forms (MF), the presence of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis; disseminated forms (DF), the presence of two or more extrapulmonary locations; and miliary TB, which was defined by a diffuse pulmonary radiographic pattern or diagnosis was undertaken by necropsy. RESULTS A total of 921 tuberculosis infected patients were observed, of which 370 (40.2%) were extrapulmonary forms; of these, 199 were men and 171 women (mean age was 36.9 years, range 19-68). The distribution of EFP was: 307 EF (83%) of which 140 (45.6%) were pleural, 87 (28.3%) ganglionary, 16 (5.2%) intestinal, 14 (4.5%) bone and joint, 11 (3.6%) genitourinary, 11 (3.6%) cutaneous, 10 (3.3%) meningeal, and other locations 18 (5.9); MF 38 cases (10.3%); DF 8 cases (2.1%) and miliary TB 1 cases (4.6%). In HIV infected patients 17 EF (77.3%), which were mainly ganglionary (64.7%); 4 DF (18.2%); and 1 miliary TB (4.5%) cases were observed. CONCLUSIONS Our findings confirm the high incidence of extrapulmonary TB, similar to the number of pulmonary forms. Our experience shows a significant modification to the classical presentation of the disease, and thus the need for sensitivity in locating the disease.</dc:description>
