<dc:description xml:lang="en">Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction is defined as a syndrome related to any process which affects intestinal regulation and propulsion. Its origin may be muscular, neurogenic or hormonal, excluding Hirschsprung's disease or any known mechanical obstruction. Between 1989 and 1991, 11 patients with intestinal pseudo-obstruction were studied at our centre, and included nine hyperganglionisms B, and two hypoganglionisms) and two visceral myopathies (Berdon's syndrome). Diagnosis was established in all cases by histologic study. The techniques of haematoxylin-eosin, acetylcholinesterase, enolase, protein S-100 and Smith were used in neuropathies and haematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichromic in myopathies. Intestinal motility was studied by ano-rectal and gastrointestinal manometry in seven and three cases respectively. Gastrointestinal manometry and radiology permitted differentiation of localized and diffuse forms of involvement. Medical treatment consisted of total parenteral nutrition when oral feeding was impossible, and in five cases, cisapride was given, with good results in four. Derivative surgery was performed in cases of diffuse involvement, and resection with anastomosis in those of localized forms. We conclude that: 1. Diagnosis is established according to histologic criteria. 2. Complementary examinations should be directed towards distinguishing localized from diffuse involvement. 3. Cisapride was effective in the treatment of neuropathies in the majority of cases.</dc:description>
