<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics and factors associated to the presence of fever in the tuberculous disease. One hundred and three patients were included in the study (29 infected by the HIV, 24 old patients with more than 65 years of age and 50 adults). Fever was present in 59.2% of the patients, in 89.7% of the HIV positives, 52% of the adults and 37.5% of the old patients (p &lt; 0.001). The factors associated to the absence of fever were advanced age and localized pulmonary disease, being almost always present in the HIV-positive patients, in the disseminated disease and in the tuberculous pleuritis. It showed a non-specific pattern and was greater than 38.5% in 52% of the HIV-positive patients and in 23.3% of the HIV-negative patients (p &lt; 0.01). The average duration of fever before starting the treatment was 32.6% +/- 27.7 days and we did not observe any differences between subgroups. Fever may be absent in a high percentage of the patients with active tuberculosis, specifically in the aged patients, although it is almost always present in the HIV-positive patients. The delay period between the onset of this symptom and the beginning of the treatment is still too long.</dc:description>
