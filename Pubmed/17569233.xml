<dc:description xml:lang="en">The appearance at the homes of our elderly of a new caretaker who is foreign to the family unit and in need of preparation justifies the creation of a multidisciplinary Formative Course at the local level. Groups were captured at civic and social centers in the town. A theoretical-practical methodology was used, dealing with diverse themes ranging from the elderly's general hygiene needs to social resources of interest to the groups. The participants' cultural diversity permitted a continuous flow of information among the participants, enriching the contents with personal anecdotes which will prove to be of great use for the application of treatment. Although 50% of the participants were non-Spanish speakers, the practical nature of the workshops proved of great usefulness since it facilitated the participation and integration of the group.</dc:description>
