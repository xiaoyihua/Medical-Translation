<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND There is an association not yet known, between high levels of HIV-1 RNA and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). There is also a barely known association between HIV-1 RNA levels and HIV-associated glomerular disease. OBJECTIVE To determine the association between high HIV-1 RNA levels and alterations in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with HIV infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a prospective trial involving 198 seropositive HIV patients. three groups were formed: 53 patients with abnormal GFR (group I); 48 patients with proteinuria greater than 300 mg and less than 1 g in 24 h urine collection and/or with urinary cast (group 2); and 87 patients without nephropathy (group 3). We carried out comparative analysis for the most common factors associated with nephropathy in HIV seropositive patients. RESULTS Within factors associated with nephropathy, only RNA-HIV-1 plasma levels had a statistically significant association with altered GFR. (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION High levels of HIV-1 RNA are associated with initial forms of HIV- associated glomerulopathy, which do not have a rapid course to end- stage renal disease, but that do cause glomerular dysfunction, that could be subjected to early interventions.</dc:description>
