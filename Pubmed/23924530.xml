<dc:description xml:lang="en">Human immunodeficiency virus infection causes a severe depletion of TCD4+ lymphocytes and a sustained immune activation state, hallmarks findings that led to numerical and phenotypic changes in the TCD4+ subsets. Highly active anti-retroviral therapy has substantially modified the course of HIV infection. Correct adherence to the treatment results in a decrease in viral load at undetectable levels and a significant increase in the number of peripheral T cell lymphocytes. In the present study association between changes in T cell subsets and treatment adherence was evaluated in 28 HIV (+) infected children, before and after 9 months on average, from starting anti-retroviral therapy. The group of 18 patients with good adherence, above 95%, showed a significant increase in CD4+CD45RA+CD62L+ naive cells percentual levels and a decrease in the CD4+CD45RA-CD62L+ central memory subset, between the two points of the follow-up period. Conversely, 10 children with failure in the adherence did not show significant differences in the percentual levels of both subsets. Improvement in the percentage of adherence among paediatric population, optimizing antiretroviral treatment, allows a quick and significant reduction of viral replication. This feature is associated with the progressive reconstitution of the immune system.</dc:description>
