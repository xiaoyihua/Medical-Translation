<dc:description xml:lang="en">The gradual increase in life expectancy in the Spanish population has led to an increase cancer episodes (the second leading cause of mortality in Spain), and an increase in wounds of neoplastic origin, which have a different healing time from other wounds. This article describes the case of an 85 year-old woman with a malignant wound, due to a recurrent skin lymphangiosarcoma, and her inclusion in the Primary Care home care program with the home care support team (PADES). The overall assessment of the person and not just "the wound", and an individualised nursing care plan led to pain control, wound healing and prevention of complications (constipation, worsening of the injury). Tumour wound care using the process of moist wound healing has been effective even in a fragile tissue. Monitoring and surrounding skin care is essential for the wound not to deteriorate further. In addition, hospitalisation of the patient, with the negative impact it could have on the quality of life of both the patient and her family, was avoided.</dc:description>
