<dc:description xml:lang="en">In patients subjected to bilio-intestinal anastomosis as treatment of several diseases of the biliary tract and the Oddi's sphincter, with some frequency have symptoms that make suspect that the anastomosis is stenosed. The experience obtained in the evaluation of 8 cases is presented. The method used was radioisotopic cholangiography, with the administration of pyridoxiphenylalanine labeled with 99m-Technetium. Serial images were obtained in Polaroid film. In three of the eight patients, an obstruction of the principal bile duct was shown. After the operation, there was normal patency of the anastomosis. In the other cases, there was normal patency of the anastomosis, and the symptoms were due to other causes. We consider the radioisotopic cholangiography as the method of election in the study of these patients, as the results may indicate a surgical re-intervention, avoid another harmful method or make unnecessary another operation.</dc:description>
