<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The objectives of our study were: to identify the stressor agents of the nursing staff according to the sociodemographical and professional characteristics; to know if the frequency of exposure to job stressors is modified based on sociodemographical characteristics; and to know if there is a relationship between job stress and satisfaction. MATERIAL AND METHOD The study sample was made up of 71 nurses (N) and 48 nursing assistants (NA). Information was collected with a self-administrated questionnaire. Satisfaction was assessed with the Warr, Cook and Wall survey and job stressors with the &lt;Nursing Stress Scale.&gt; Demographic and professional variables were collected. RESULTS The percentage of responses was 88.2%. Mean stress in SD was significantly higher than in the NA, 38 (10.7) and 27.9 (9.2) respectively; p &lt; 0.001. The stressor mean is higher based on age and type of contract in both categories. We have not found any differences in relationship to satisfaction. Both categories identified as main stressors those related with the patient's suffering, death and job excess. CONCLUSIONS 1) The most frequently identified job stressors in both categories are those related with patient suffering, death and job excess. 2) The Ns have a significantly greater exposure to job stressors. 3) Young age and insecurity in the job increase exposure to job stressors. 4) We have not found any relationship between the job stressors and satisfaction.</dc:description>
