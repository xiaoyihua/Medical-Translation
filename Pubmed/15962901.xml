<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND A prevalence survey of dental fluorosis was conducted among primary school students in Caldas, a small province in west central Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS The cross-sectional study compared the prevalence of dental fluorosis in the four regions of Caldas. In the urban area, a probabilistic sample was selected and,in the rural areas, students were sampled in locations that were readily accessible. One thousand sixty-one students were examined while at school in daylight conditions. The surveillance tool applied was the Dean Index. Univariate and bivariate analyses were made with a chi-square test being applied for the latter to show independence among variables. RESULTS Sixty-three percent (95% CI: 60-66%) of primary school students were affected by fluorosis to some degree of severity. Among them, 56% (95% CI: 52-59) were classified in the mild and very mild degrees, whereas 7% (95% CI: 2-16) were classified as moderate or severe. A statistically significant association between the region variable and dental fluorosis was observed. However, no association was found with gender, area, schooling or age variables. Within Caldas, the eastern region showed the lowest prevalence (47.9%) in contrast to the other three areas (northern, central-south and western) where prevalences exceeded 68%. CONCLUSIONS At least two of three primary school students in Caldas suffer from some degree of dental fluorosis.</dc:description>
