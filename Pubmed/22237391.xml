<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical, radiological and genetic findings of a family affected by Currarino syndrome (CS) (agenesis of the sacrum, presacral mass, and anal-rectal anomalies), and to familiarise the radiologist with this condition that, although uncommon, could be suspected by its characteristic images. MATERIAL AND METHODS A study was made of 8 out of 9 family members (the parents, 7 siblings; 4 males and 3 females) suspected of having CS. The clinical and genetic findings are described. Using simple X-rays, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, the presence of agenesis of the sacrum, a presacral mass and anal-rectal anomalies were investigated. Furthermore, a genetic analysis of the HLBX9 gene was performed. Permission by the Ethics Committee was not requested as all the family members gave their consent by signing a document. RESULTS The mother with a scimitar-shaped sacrum confirmed that she was the transmitter of the genetic mutation. One of the seven siblings had complete CS (sacral agenesis, anorectal stenosis, and anterior meningocele). Four siblings had an incomplete CS: 3 with sacral agenesis and a presacral mass (two anterior meningoceles and one teratoma) and the fourth with sacral agenesis and anorectal stenosis. One sibling had no anomalies. The mother, as well as four siblings, did not have the HLXB9 gene mutation. CONCLUSION When there is sacral agenesis, the possibility of presacral masses and anorectal changes should be investigated. Likewise, if there is familial association, they should be investigated for a CS.</dc:description>
