<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Lithiasic pathology continues being very prevalent in our environment. There are multiple approaches and treatments to solve it in current urology. Lately, endourological techniques have suffered a spectacular advance which has permitted to increase their success rates, diminishing also their comorbidity very much. Nevertheless, despite all improvements we still face a series of complications that may reduce the success of the procedure. Among all of them, we emphasize stone retropulsion during endoscopic lithotripsy, because it appears in an important number of procedures and, it does not only diminish the range of stone free patients, but also is associated with a longer surgical time, and occasionally will make necessary the employment of additional procedures that increase cost and treatment morbidity. To reduce the incidence of this retropulsion classical manoeuvres have been employed: antitrendelenburg, decrease of the intensity of the irrigaton flow, modification of laser parameters, or pneumatic balloons. Currently, we have other more effective mechanisms to combat it, among them: the devices that occlude the ureteral lumen, and nitinol baskets/forceps. Adequate selection of the stone extraction device may be definitive for completion of the ureterorenoscopic procedure with success, and in the programmed time. The election of an inadequate device may make the procedure impossible or cause iatrogenic damage to the urinary tract. For all it, specific instruments to entrap and extract stones (baskets and ureteral lumen occlusion devices) is an armamentarium that every endourologist should be familiar with.</dc:description>
