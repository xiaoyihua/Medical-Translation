<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing and difficult-to-control arterial hyper-tension. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients were considered to have difficult-to-control hypertension when mean systolic blood pressure was 125 mm Hg or higher and/or mean diastolic blood pressure was more than or equal to 80 mm Hg (as recorded during 2 24-hour ambulatory monitoring studies) despite the use of 3 or more antihypertensive drugs. Respiratory polygraphy using the AutoSet device (ResMed Corp, Sydney, Australia) was then performed to study sleep-disordered breathing in all patients. RESULTS Forty-nine patients with a mean (SD) age of 68.1 (9.1) years, mean systolic and diastolic pressures of 152.5 (13)/89.2 (8.5) mm Hg, and an average of 3.5 prescribed drugs were included in the study. The mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 26.2 (19.5) and events were predominantly obstructive. Patients with severe sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) (AHI &gt; or = 30; 40.8%) showed more uncontrolled daytime (P = .017) and nighttime (P = .033) systolic pressure than the rest, as well as higher daytime diastolic pressure (P = .035) and a greater consumption of drugs than those without severe SAHS (AHI &lt; 10; 28.6%) (P = .041). The study population as a whole showed a significant correlation between blood pressure and obesity. There was a significant correlation (adjusted for age and sex) with AHI only in patients with SAHS. AHI was found to be the independent predictor with the greatest effect on blood pressure in these patients. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of SAHS was very high in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension. In patients with SAHS, AHI was found to be the independent predictor with the greatest affect on arterial blood pressure.</dc:description>
