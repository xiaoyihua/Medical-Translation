<dc:description xml:lang="en">In recent years several acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drugs have been developed for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease. These are expensive and their usefulness is doubtful. OBJECTIVE. We wish to review the evidence available with regard to the efficacy and effectiveness of the anticholinesterase drugs permitted in Spain. DEVELOPMENT. We review the controlled clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analysis published on the anticholinesterases permitted in Spain (tacrine, donepezil and rivastingmine), and also the publications on their effectiveness and efficacy. CONCLUSIONS. The evidence available seems to show that these drugs are effective in producing modest but real cognitive improvement in persons with mild and moderate Alzheimer s disease (Type 1 evidence). Cognitive improvement has also been observed in everyday clinical practice. Use of these drugs may be associated with a reduction in the costs associated with this disease. These drugs are useful and should be used in persons with mild or moderate Alzheimer s disease, without any contra-indication.</dc:description>
