<dc:description xml:lang="en">Between August 1991 and December 1998, 400 patients (lymphomas: 197; acute leukemia: 86; multiple myeloma: 70 and solid tumors: 47) were admitted for autologous transplantation. All patients were mobilized with chemotherapy plus G-CSF. The hematological recovery was similar in all disease groups. Patients with acute leukemias and multiple myeloma had a slower platelet recovery. Treatment-related death was 4.5%. The status of the disease at diagnosis was the most significant prognostic factor. With a median follow-up of 23 months the probability of event-free survival at 60 months was 46% for low grade lymphoma, 44% for intermediate and high grade lymphoma, 58% for Hodgkin's disease, 45% for acute myeloblastic leukemia, 38% for solid tumors and 15% for multiple myeloma. The probability of survival at 60 months was 67% for low grade lymphoma, 47% for intermediate and high grade lymphoma, 75% for Hodgkin's disease, 52% for acute myeloblastic leukemia, 54% for solid tumors and 25% for multiple myeloma. It can be concluded that autologous progenitor cell transplantation induces a complete and faster hematological recovery in all groups of patients without any late graft failure. Results are similar to those published in the literature. The treatment-related death was low and acceptable.</dc:description>
