<dc:description xml:lang="en">Percutaneous fine bore silicone central catheters are frequently used in sick full term newborns and in low birth weight premature infants; although their use has some risks. We report two cases of pleural effusion in two prematures of 34 and 33 weeks gestation and birth weight of 1,510 and 1,650 g, respectively; and one case neumonitis in a newborn of a 38 weeks gestation and 2,730 g birth weight. All of them have in common same initial clinical sign: increase mucus secretion of the upper airway a few hours after the beginning of parenteral nutrition using the type of catheter mentioned with the tip abnormally located in pulmonary artery. These complications are probably related to endothelial injury of very slow flow vessels due to the high osmolarity and low pH of the parenteral solutions used; which probably, in turn, produce thrombosis and vascular perforation, and/or extravasation. We suggest to suspect a pulmonary artery abnormally located catheter in patients receiving parenteral nutrition who increase upper airway mucus secretion. The rapid correction of the position would prevent major complications.</dc:description>
