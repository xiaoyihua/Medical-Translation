<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of households in the Mixteca Baja and analyze differences in affiliation with health care programs and utilization, among members of households with migrants (HogMig) and without migrants (HogNoMig) to the United States. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional, descriptive survey was used with heads of households in a representative sample from the Mixteca Baja of 702 homes with and without migrants to the US. RESULTS Members of HogMig had more personal and economic resources than those of HogNoMig; they also regularly received remittances. The majority of members of both HogMig and HogNoMig did not receive benefits from the Oportunidades program or health coverage through Seguro Popular, IMSS or ISSSTE. In general, while they used the local health clinic, they often preferred to pay for private practitioners. A small proportion of those covered by IMSS or ISSSTE reported very low utilization of the health services offered by those institutions.</dc:description>
