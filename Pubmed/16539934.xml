<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness and describe the complications of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between May 1997 and September 2003, our department scheduled 147 VATS procedures for spontaneous pneumothorax in 127 patients (102 men [80.5%]). The mean (SD) age for the series was 28.3 (11.6) years. Bullae and blebs were resected by endostapler and vigorous pleural abrasion was carried out. Vanderschueren staging was as follows: stage I, 10 (6.8%); stage II, 22 (15%); stage III, 71 (48.3%); and stage IV, 44 (29.9%). The procedure was indicated for the following reasons: third episode, 56 (38.1%); persistent air leak, 47 (32%); elective, 16 (10.9%); simultaneous bilateral pneumothorax, 28 (19%). VATS was performed on the right side only in 85 patients (57.8%), on the left in 62 (42.2%), and on both sides in 16 (11.6%). RESULTS A total of 137 of the 147 VATS procedures scheduled (93.2%) were performed, and there were no deaths. The rate of conversion to thoracotomy was 6.8%, and the overall rate of complications was 13.7%. Postoperative complications were due to bleeding in 5 cases (3.6%), air leak (&gt;5 days) in 10 (7.2%), wound infection in 2 (1.4%), residual pneumothorax in 4 (2.9%), need to insert a new pleural drain in 3 (2.1%), and pleural empyema in 1 (0.7%). Two patients took oral analgesics for more than 30 days after the procedure. Pneumothorax recurred during follow-up in 7 patients (5.1%). No significant correlation was found between recurrence of pneumothorax after VATS and Vandeschueren stage, age, bilaterality of the procedure, indication, or days of postoperative drainage (P&gt;.05). CONCLUSIONS VATS for resection of pleural lesions plus pleural abrasion is an efficacious and simple treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax regardless of intraoperative findings.</dc:description>
