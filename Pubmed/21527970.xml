<dc:description xml:lang="en">The 2010 undergraduate medical degree curriculum at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) faculty of medicine is based on the reality of the operating structure of the medical care units qualified for teaching. The clinical teaching/learning is based on the cooperative work of the professor and student; this means, it is based on the institutional physician responsible for medical care in a professor/assistant action together with the student being brought up. Therefore, the permanent education and training of all medical teams in the institutions offering teaching is essential. Teaching must be one distinctive characteristic of excellence for the units of the Health Ministry as it is teaching the central factor that raises the quality of medical care. The clinical evaluation must be permanent, improving the value of the daily action in front of a patient at the formative level and as a means to allow the assessment for its development, as it is the clinical aspect that is the essence of medicine.</dc:description>
