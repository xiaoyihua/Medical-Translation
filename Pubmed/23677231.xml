<dc:description xml:lang="en">Nephrotic syndrome secondary to paraneoplastic glomerulopathies is exceptional. We are aware of only three cases reported of cervical carcinomas associated with nephrotic syndrome. Two women, aged 40 and 79 years, presented with nephrotic syndrome. The first had a membranous nephropathy and the second was not biopsied. The first women had a metrorrhagia after 8 months of unsuccessful therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. An advanced cervical carcinoma with lymph node metastases was found. In the second patient, a cervical carcinoma and hematometra was discovered two months after diagnosis ofa nephrotic syndrome. The syndrome subsided completely, nine months after radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the first patient and 10 months after hysterectomy in the second patient.</dc:description>
