<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES although efficacious, some patients do not respond optimally to overactive bladder (OAB) treatment. The objective of this study was to identify the reasons why some patients do not respond and to look for reasons for changes in treatment and patient satisfaction with the new treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS epidemiological, cross-sectional, non-interventional study to determine the reasons for OAB treatment switching and satisfaction with such OAB treatment switch. OAB patients (OAB-V8≥8), 18 years or more, who had modified their treatment during the previous 3-4 months, were recruited. Demographic data, symptoms, previous, current and concomitant treatments, reasons for treatment switch, clinical global impression (CGI) on disease severity and symptom improvement, Morinsky Green questionnaire, satisfaction with treatment, treatment preference and treatment benefit scale (TBS) were compared. RESULTS out of 3,365 successive patients, 2,038 (61%) were eligible (61.1±11.2 years; 77% women). The physician decided to switch in 69% of the cases and 31% of patients asked for a change in treatment. Reasons for switching were lack of clinical benefit (60%), side effects (24%), patients' request (8%), non-compliance (6%) and other (2%). 52% of patients complied with new treatment. According to the CGI, 65.4% showed improvement with respect to their previous treatment. 60% were quite/very satisfied with current treatment, 91% preferred it to their previous treatment and 93% reported that their symptoms had improved. CONCLUSIONS the lack of clinical benefit is the main reason for changing OAB treatment. Most of the patients that switched prefer their new treatment.</dc:description>
