<dc:description xml:lang="en">The symptomatic infiltration to bone marrow by gastric carcinoma is an extremely infrequent condition even so as an early manifestation. Very few reports exist in the worldwide literature about it. In this paper we report a case of a 47 years woman who was attended in our Institute because of the presence of thrombocytopenia, anaemia, fever involuntary weight loss and linfadenopathy, and also dyspepsia. Through her diagnostic evaluation the diagnosis of an occult gastric cancer was established. The aim of this report is to present the clinical, radiological and pathological characteristics of this unusual presentation of gastric cancer; and also we present a brief literature review of the cases that had been reported and their clinical implication.</dc:description>
