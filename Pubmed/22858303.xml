<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION An excessive risk for bacteremia has recently been reported in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treated with intravenous treprostinil. We aimed to assess this association in a cohort of patients from a Spanish referral center. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study that included 55 patients diagnosed with PAH who received a continuous intravenous infusion of a prostanoid (epoprostenol or treprostinil) for ≥1month at our center between January 1991 and December 2011. The risk factors associated with the incidence of bacteremia were analyzed with the log-rank test. RESULTS After a total follow-up of 64,453 treatment days, we found 12 episodes of bacteremia: Staphylococcus aureus (5 episodes), non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (4 episodes), other gram-positive cocci (2 episodes), and Enterobacter cloacae (one episode). The incidence of bacteremia was 0.118 episodes per 1,000 treatment days in patients receiving epoprostenol versus 0.938 episodes per 1,000 treatment-days in patients receiving treprostinil (P=.0037). All episodes of bacteremia due to Gram-negative bacilli were diagnosed in patients on treprostinil. In the univariate analysis the treatment with intravenous treprostinil was associated with the incidence of bacteremia (hazard ratio: 4.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.24-14.53), although the low number of events prevented us from performing a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Therapy with intravenous treprostinil is associated with a higher risk for bacteremia, especially due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. This association should be taken in consideration when choosing empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with PAH and sepsis.</dc:description>
