<dc:description xml:lang="en">We made a retrospective descriptive study reviewing 92 patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary tumour. The study was accomplished during 6 years. (January 1996 to December 2001) in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the Hospital Reina Sofia, Córdoba. The median age was 61.7 years old, male 96.7% and heavy smoker (89.1%) and drinkers most of them. According to TNM categories, 72.2% patients were in phase N2a and half of them were localized Level II. Squamous cell carcinoma was the predominant histologic type.
