<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION After several years of erythropoietin (EPO) use in the prophylaxis of anaemia of prematurity, it also began to be administered to treat post-haemolytic disease anaemia of the newborn in order to avoid blood transfusions. OBJECTIVE To show the results obtained with EPO treatment in post-haemolytic disease anemia of the newborn. PATIENTS AND METHODS Observational study in 13 newborns with late anaemia due to an hemolytic disease caused by Rh isoimmunization (9 cases), AB0 isoimmunization (2 cases), glucose-6-P-dehydrogenase deficiency (1 case) or idiopathic (1 case). The newborns began EPO treatment when they reached the haematocrit level for a blood transfusion. RESULTS EPO treatment was started at 26±7 days of life (15-46), with a haematocrit value of 21.7±3% (18-27) and a reticulocyte count of 3.8±2.2%. Blood transfusion was not necessary in 11 newborns (haematocrit of 30.7±4.4% and reticulocytes of 5.9±1.4%), and only 2 newborns were admitted for a blood transfusion (haematocrit 18±4.4% and reticulocytes 0.6%). Significant increases in haemoglobin and reticulocyte figures were seen after EPO treatment. CONCLUSIONS EPO administration proved useful to avoid blood transfusion in 84% of treated newborns. No adverse events were detected which could be attributed to this treatment,.</dc:description>
