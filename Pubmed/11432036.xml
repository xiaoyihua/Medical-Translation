<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the diagnostic methods utilized in prostate cancer and the preoperative information on the extent of the tumor, and compare these results with those obtained from anatomopathological analyses of the radical prostatectomy specimen. METHODS Data on the radical prostatectomies performed during the study period were obtained from the Admissions and Clinical Records services and were analyzed using the SPSS statistical analysis software for Windows. RESULTS From 1991 to 1998, 109 radical prostatectomies were performed. Evaluation by transrectal US was carried out in 89 patients (81.6%) and detected a tumor (unilateral or bilateral) in 77, for a sensitivity of 86% (CI 78.8-93.2). A CT study was performed in 94 patients and was positive in 25, for a sensitivity of 26.5% (CI 17.6-35.4). The sensitivity for transrectal US and CT were 4.17% and 3.33% for capsular involvement, 5.88% and 5.26% for seminal vesicle involvement, and 0% and 0% for node involvement, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Transrectal ultrasound is a reliable diagnostic imaging method, although it has a low sensitivity when used to determine the extent of the tumor. In our series, the radiological methods showed a low sensitivity when they were utilized to determine the extent of the prostate cancer. Routine preoperative assessment by CT can be obviated in prostate cancer.</dc:description>
