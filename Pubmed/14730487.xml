<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To validate the test of memory malingering (TOMM), and to study the influence of intelligence and memory on its performance in brain injury patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 30 patients with traumatic head injury were included in the study. All patients were assessed with the Complutense verbal learning test, the Visual Reproduction subtest of the Wechsler memory scale-revised, the Boston naming test, two fluency tests (FAS, and animals), the Wechsler adult intelligence test-III, and with the TOMM. Cognitive results below 1 standard deviation (SD) from normative data were considered 'abnormal'. A parametric correlation between TOMM scores and cognitive tests was used to detect whether memory and intelligence were affecting TOMM performance. Statistical significance was set up at p&lt;0.05. RESULTS Between 46.1% (Boston) and 81.4% (WAIS-III performance IQ) of the sample presented cognitive deficits. Up to 83.3% of the patients scored above the cutoff point suggestive of malingering in the TOMM (45/50). Significance correlations were found between TOMM scores and memory or intelligence indexes. DISCUSSION The TOMM is a useful tool to detect malingering in head injured patients. Effects of low intelligence coefficients, as well as memory deficits should be considered in clinical practice when evaluating patients with TOMM scores suggestive of malingering.</dc:description>
