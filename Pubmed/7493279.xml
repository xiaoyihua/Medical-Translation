<dc:description xml:lang="en">Although in the last few years care quality programs have started to be used in services, these are still few in nursing equipment. Our aim is to show the process we have followed to design a nursing care quality program in ICU. We developed the stages of process, where a list of general activities performed in the service was created to establish a priority later, as it was necessary, due to the high number of aspects or activities to monitor, to choose those we would use to start the quality control program. The ultimate order was settled with the following activities: 1. Surveillance of the infection. 2. Accidental withdrawal of tubes and catheters. 3. Pressure ulcers.</dc:description>
