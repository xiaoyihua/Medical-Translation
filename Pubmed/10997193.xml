<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two hundred and three (203) open heart surgical procedures have been performed at the Complejo Hospitalario Metropolitano, from January 1997 to august 1998; Hundred and twenty-three (123) were of myocardial revascularization and twenty-four (24) of these patients were selected for revascularization without the assistance of the extracorporeal circulation machine. They were patients with chronic stable angina and had lesions of more than 95% in the descending anterior artery, high ventriculo-lateral branch and right coronary artery up to the crux cordis. In nineteen (19) patients the surgical approach was though a medical sternotomy; in four (4) through a left anterolateral thoracostomy and in three (3) of these patients a transverse sternotomy was added. There were no deaths perioperatively and at thirty (30) days there were no evidences of new Q waves or residual angina. With this technique, the time in the Intensive Care Unit and in the hospital has diminished; the patients also required less time in mechanical ventilation; less vasoactive amines are needed. In the operating room less equipment is necessary and the costs are significantly lower.</dc:description>
