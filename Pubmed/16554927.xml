<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND There is an increasing importance of pet-transmitted infections, some of those are considered emerging infections. AIM To determine the species and frequency of intestinal parasites in pets with diarrhea (hemorrhagic gastroenteritis excluded). MATERIAL AND METHODS A descriptive retrospective study. Fecal samples from 972 dogs and 230 cats consulting in two veterinary practices in Santiago, between 1996 and 2003, were studied using Burrows' technique. RESULTS Protozoa were found in 64.8% of dogs and in 66.5% of cats; helminthes in 24% of dogs and 45.2% of cats. The species found in dogs were Blastocystis sp. in 36%, Ameba sp. in 31%, Giardia intestinalis in 22%, Toxocara canis in 11%, Chilomastix sp. in 10%, Isospora sp. in 9%, Trichuris vulpis in 9%, Trichomonas sp. in 5%, Sarcocystis sp. in 4%, Dipylidium caninum in 2%, Ancylostomideos in 2%, Toxascaris leonina in 1%, Physaloptera sp. in 1%, Taenia sp. in 0.4%. Species found in cats were Blastocystis sp. in 37%, Ameba sp. in 30%, G intestinalis in 19%, Chilomastix sp. in 12%, Isospora sp. in 12%, Toxocara cati in 10%, D caninum in 7%, Sarcocystis sp. in 5%, Trichomona sp. in 5%, Toxoplasma gondii in 4%, Taenia sp. in 2% and Physaloptera sp. in 1%. Forty eight percent of parasites found in dogs and 49% found in cats have zoonotic potential. In dogs younger than six months Blastocystis sp., Ameba sp., G intestinalis, Chilomastix sp., Isospora sp. and T canis were significantly more common; the same was observed for Isospora in young cats. Approximately 60% of infected animals bore more than one parasite. CONCLUSIONS A high rate of intestinal parasitism in pets with diarrhea was found; an important proportion of them have zoonotic potential.</dc:description>
