<dc:description xml:lang="en">Spasticity is a common problem in paediatric neurology and its management constitutes a real professional challenge. There are numerous therapeutic options available and their advantages and disadvantages should be carefully weighed up for each individual patient. It is true that we do not have one single final option, but experience and knowledge of the therapeutic possibilities favour the functional improvement of patients suffering from spasticity. In this paper, we analyse the different drugs available for oral administration in the treatment of spasticity. Special attention is given to the side effects and interactions of these drugs in multiple deficiency patients, who are usually already receiving other medication. We review the mechanism of action, the forms of presentation and dosage, the side effects and interactions of baclofen, diazepam, clonidine, tizanidine, modafilin, gabapentin and dantrolene. Finally, other drugs that may be useful in improving spasticity are also analysed.</dc:description>
