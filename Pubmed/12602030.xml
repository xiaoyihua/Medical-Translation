RESULTS A significant reduction of cancellations have been obtain (from 12.38% in 1992 to 3.35% in 1997). The inevitable causes (no presentation, inadequate preparation and lack of time in the surgical room) have shown the most improvement. Although the inevitable causes (intercurrent disease) were also significantly improved, after obtaining prior information of the health of the child, by telephone call or parents advise. ENT is the speciality with greatest improvement by significant reduction of the non presentation and intercurrent disease.
