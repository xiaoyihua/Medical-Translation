<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To review two cases with the diagnostic suspicion of urinary tract tumor by clinical picture and imaging tests in which pathology of the surgical specimen revealed metastasis of gastric adenocarcinoma. METHODS 82 and 68 year-old patients with past history of gastric adenocarcinoma that had undergone surgical treatment 6 months and 6 years before urology consultation,respectively. They were diagnosed upper urinary tract tumors by CT scan. RESULTS Definitive pathologic diagnosis of urinary tract metastasis of gastric adenocarcinoma was obtained after radical surgery in both cases. CONCLUSIONS Clinical and radiologic presentation of urothelial metastases of gastric adenocarcinoma may simulate de novo urothelial tumors. Evolution in these patients is usually bad although we currently don't have enough information to issue a therapeutic guide to follow.</dc:description>
