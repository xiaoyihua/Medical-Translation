<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Most chest radiography scoring systems for patients with cystic fibrosis have been developed for children but are also used for adults. Our aim was to evaluate the intra- and interobserver variability of 2 radiographic scoring systems in adults with cystic fibrosis and to assess the correlation of these systems with clinical and spirometric parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS The chest x-rays of 24 adult patients with cystic fibrosis were compared using 2 scoring systems (Brasfield and Chrispin-Norman). The x-rays were scored by 2 radiologists and reevaluated 4 months later by 1 of the 2 observers. Intra- and interobserver agreement was assessed using the intraclass and Pearson's correlation coefficients. The radiographic scores were compared to lung function tests and other clinical data. RESULTS Both intra- and interobserver agreement were high (r &gt; or = 0.9 and the intraclass correlation coefficient &gt; or = 0.85 with both systems for both samples). Both scoring systems correlated with spirometry results: forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) (r = 0.64 and r = 0.55), FEV1% (r = 0.75 and r = 0.72), and the percentage of forced vital capacity in relation to the predicted value (r = 0.63 and r = 0.056). We found no association between scoring system and sex, age, or body mass index. CONCLUSIONS Assessment of chest radiographs of adult patients with cystic fibrosis by the Brasfield and Chrispin-Norman scoring systems shows good intra- and interobserver agreement. Both systems correlate well with lung function variables, especially FEV1.</dc:description>
