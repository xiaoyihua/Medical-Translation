<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a tumour of epithelial origin that represents the most common malignant neoplasm of the minor salivary glands. However, little is known about the genes involved in the development and progression of this tumour. Cyclin D1 gene (CCND1) plays a key role in the control of the cell cycle, and its amplification is described in numerous cancers. The aim of this study is to determine the amplification of the CCND1 gene in the ACC of the minor salivary glands. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study was performed on 12 patients with ACC of the head and neck. The amplification of the CCND1 was determined using multiple PCR. RESULTS Amplification of the CCND1 was found in 4 patients (33.3%). No correlation was found between CCND1 amplification and clinicopathological parameters, although disease-free survival was diminished in patients with amplification. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates for the first time the amplification of the CCND1 gene in ACC. We have found an amplification rate similar to others neoplasms. CCND1 amplification seems to be associated with a poorer prognosis in these tumours, although this needs to be confirmed in larger studies.</dc:description>
