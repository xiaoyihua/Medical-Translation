<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Critical patients usually have hemodynamic disturbances which may become worse by the administration of some drugs. Omeprazole is a drug used in the prophylaxis of the gastrointestinal bleeding in these patients, but its cardiovascular effects are unknown. The objective was to study the hemodynamic changes produced by intravenous omeprazole in critically ill children and to find out if there are differences between two different doses of omeprazole. MATERIAL AND METHODS A randomized prospective observational study was performed on 37 critically ill children aged from 1 month to 14 years of age who required prophylaxis for gastrointestinal bleeding. Of these, 19 received intravenous omeprazole 0.5mg/kg every 12 hours, and 18 received intravenous omeprazole 1mg/kg every 12 hours. Intravenous omeprazole was administered in 20 minutes by continuous infusion pump. Heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure and ECG were recorded at baseline, and at 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes of the infusion. RESULTS There were no significant changes in the electrocardiogram, heart rate, blood pressure and central venous pressure. No patients required inotropic therapy modification. There were no differences between the two doses of omeprazole. CONCLUSIONS Intravenous omeprazole administration of 0.5mg/kg and 1mg/kg is a hemodynamically safe drug in critically ill children.</dc:description>
