<dc:description xml:lang="en">Lithiasis as a post-renal transplantation complication is rare and of delayed appearance. After having revised 320 transplantations performed at the Fundación Puigvert 8 cases were found, which implies a two-fold increased incidence over other series studied and greater than the prevalence in the normal population. We confirmed the existence of lithogenous factors in 7 of the 8 cases, and found that in 50% of them the calculus composition was urate, what explained the differences versus normal population in terms of treatment with cyclosporin and the personal background. Two therapeutic schemes may be outlined based on the chemical composition of the calculus, and thus ultrasound-guided ESWL is chosen as chronic therapy when calculi have a calcic origin whereas medical management is used when their nature is uric, even though we understand that treatment must be individualized in each case. We have obtained good results in all 8 cases without compromising neither the renal function nor the graft viability.</dc:description>
