<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report two patients with large-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas who were treated with intensive chemotherapy (MACOP-B), and in whom large isolated intraparenchymal masses (splenic in one case, renal in the other) were found with computed tomography after clinical remission. It was found at surgery that both masses were constituted by acellular necrotic material, without tumoral infiltration and limited by fibrous tissue. The finding of these residual masses in patients in remission raises problems of approach, as they may be nontumoral and not require new therapy. At present, until new radiological or biochemical markers are available, a judicious clinical attitude should be taken, with radiological control of the evolution of the masses and reserving surgery only for those cases with progression, diagnostic doubts, or patient's decision to know his real status.</dc:description>
