<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report the case of a 61-year old man who, already for a month, had infiltrated plaques on the chest, back, neck and face as well as axilar lymphadenopathy, bearing a striking resemblance to lymphoma. During his stay in the hospital he had fever, sore throat, macules on the palms and soles and a depapilated plaque on the tongue and alopecia. A test for syphilis confirmed the diagnosis. The HIV serology was also positive. The nodular secondary syphilis is an unusual form that was first documented more than 20 years ago. Since then, only a few cases have been reported in which the first diagnosis included lymphoreticular malignancy. This form of secondary syphilis was found in the HIV-infected as well as non-infected patients. We discuss the atypical clinical course, the inappropriate serological reactions and the therapy in HIV infected patients with secondary syphilis.</dc:description>
