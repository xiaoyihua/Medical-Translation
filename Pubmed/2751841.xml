<dc:description xml:lang="en">Fifty asthmatic infants under 10 months of age included in a double blind placebo controlled trial lasting nine months. The whole group received continuous bronchodilator therapy with fenoterol + ipratropium in the first month. This was gradually discontinued in the second month, and half of the children began to receive ketotifen 0.35 mg each 12 hours, and the other placebo. The treatment was maintained for months. During this period, both groups received bronchodilators only in the presence of wheezing attacks. Bronchodilator consumption, symptoms registered in a diary card, results of a medical examination practiced each 10 days, and symptoms/bronchodilator requirements relationship were considered in the evaluation. Both groups showed a significant reduction in their symptom after the continuous bronchodilator use period. Control group did not experience further improvement within the next months, despite raising bronchodilators use. Ketotifen group improved all parameters evaluated and diminished their bronchodilator consumption. These changes reached statistical significance after three months ketotifen treatment. In the follow-up posttreatment, ketotifen group remained with significative less symptoms (p less than 0.001).</dc:description>
