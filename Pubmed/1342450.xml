<dc:description xml:lang="en">Twenty-one sterile couples, between September 1989, and August 1991, were treated for ovulation stimulation of their cycles, in order to practice in them, a in vitro fertilization and tube embryo transfer (ZIFT). Two protocols of ovulation induction were used, both with leuprolide acetate (Lupron), one in the luteal phase and the other in follicular phase and since the second or the fourth day of the cycle, respectively, gonadotropins were added (Metrodine and Pergonal). Out of all the twenty-nine initiated cycles, twenty-seven were aspirated (93.1%) and twenty-four reached an embryo transfer (82.8%). Seven clinic pregnancies were obtained (29.17% per transfer) and four deliveries (16.67% per transfer). The sterility period average was 69.64 +/- 36.6 months and the patients age average was 34.1 +/- 4.38 years. The global rate of fertilization was 63.53%. With luteal phase Lupron best results were got (pregnancy rate of 38.46% per transfer) and there were not considerable difference in the number of gonadotropins ampulla employed. When embryos were transfer to the tubes and the uteri the pregnant rate was 50% per transfer, in comparison to 18.75% when transfer was made only in the tubes.</dc:description>
