<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Evaluate the effect of dutasteride in perioperative bleeding during Transurethral Resection of Prostate (TURP). MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty consecutive patients with criteria for TURP were included. Finasteride/dutasteride use, renal impairment, prostate &lt; 30 cc, age &lt;50 were excluded. Patients were divided in 2 groups. Group 1: 24 consecutive patients treated with dutasteride 0.5 mg/day/30-days prior TURP. Group 2: 16 without treatment. Prostatic volume, difference in hemoglobin pre/post TURP, duration and amount of resected tissue were recorded. Surgeon was blinded. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Multiple linear regression, Mann-Whitney and student t-tests were used. RESULTS In group 1, 33% (8) improved their lower urinary tract symptoms and skipped TURP. Mean Hemoglobin loss difference between groups was 0.11 gr/dl (CI 95% -0.55; 0.77, p=0.88). There was no statistical difference among variables. No positive or negative predictive values in the linear regression model. CONCLUSION Dutasteride did not significantly impact the studied variables in these non randomized and small sample size settings.</dc:description>
