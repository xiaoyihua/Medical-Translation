<dc:description xml:lang="en">A protocol has been applied to all our patients consulting for nocturnal enuresis who also presented daytime wetting or urge to void, to rule out obstructive uropathies. Our protocol includes voiding cystourethrogram, IVP, cystometry and endoscopy. 64 females and 46 males, 4 to 14 year-old, were studied between 1980 and 1983. Obstructive urethral uropathy was ruled out in 37 females (58%) and 32 males (69%). The most common treatments in these patients were endoscopic resection (Bugbee) of posterior urethral valves in boys and resection of the distal ring in girls. All other associated diseases or malformations were treated according to their etiology. Results, analyzed through a questionnaire sent to parents, were good in 77% of the patients treated for obstruction. In conclusion we think that daytime wetting and urge to void are very frequently the emerging symptoms of a hidden uropathy, in most cases obstructing proximal or distal urethra. Surgical treatment can lead to a good cure rate.</dc:description>
