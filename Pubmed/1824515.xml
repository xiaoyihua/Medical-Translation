<dc:description xml:lang="en">The present study describes the effect of high doses of vitamin K3 (8-30 mg/kg) administered daily by intramuscular injection during seven days; on blood smear, red blood cells (RBC) and concentration of hemoglobin (Hb) counts, value of hematocrit (Ht), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocyte and erythroblast counts, total and differential counting of leukocytes (WBC) and total and fractionated serum bilirubin concentration of albino male rats. Results were then compared with findings in normal rats treated with the same doses of sodium bisulfite. In animals treated with vitamin K3 a statistically significant decrease in the number of erythrocytes and in the concentration of Hb, Ht and MCHC was found together with a concomitant increase of erythroblast and reticulocyte counting. In regard to the blood smear, it was observed that erythrocytes vary in their hemoglobin content, size, shape and in their staining properties (polychromatophilia) where as the leukocytes were found to be morphologically normal, but in an increased number. Lymphocytes occasionally showed azurophil granules. Platelets assumed irregular shape and in normal amounts. The leukocytes count showed leukocytosis with marked neutrophilia, eosinophilia, lymphocytosis and monocytosis. Also, the presence of clinical jaundice with an increase of the serum "indirectly-reacting" bilirubin was also observed. These findings indicate that hypervitaminosis K3 induces a marked hemolytic microcytic hypochromic anemia and changes in the white blood cells count. Further studies will be pursued in order to obtain a better understanding of the causes and/or the mechanisms that induce these alterations in the blood cells.</dc:description>
