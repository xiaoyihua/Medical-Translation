<dc:description xml:lang="en">The vascular or cartilage canals of the mandibular condyle were studied in human fetuses, whose ages extended from the 9th to the 13th week of development. The vascular canals are firstly constituted by an invagination of mesenchimal cells which is in connection with the mesenchimal layer of the condyle envelope. During the 11th week of development a vessel penetrates in the invaginations. In the 12th and 13th weeks, the canals show a clearly defined pattern: some of them are located in the anterointernal region of the condyle, being those associated with the insertion of the lateral pterygoid muscle; two or three can be seen in the posterointernal region, whereas only one vascular canal, but th-e biggest one, is located in the posteroexternal region. This well defined disposition is related with the direction of the condylar growth during this period of the development.</dc:description>
