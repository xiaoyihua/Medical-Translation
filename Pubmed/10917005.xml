<dc:description xml:lang="en">The anatomical and functional integrity of mesothelial cells (MC) is necessary for peritoneal membrane stability. At present, there is no satisfactory method to assess MC function and regenerative capacity in individual peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. MC may be cultured from peritoneal biopsy specimens, but peritoneal biopsy is an invasive procedure that cannot be performed serially. The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of serial culture of MC from the peritoneal effluent of PD patients. Fifty-two randomly selected PD patients were studied. MC were obtained from the peritoneal effluent of nocturnal 2.27% glucose exchanges and cultured in T25 tissue culture flasks. Subconfluent MC cultures were obtained in 80.7% of patients. At this stage, the percentage of cells in the tissue cultured flask characterized as MC by morphology and immunostaining had increased to 95.5%. MC were then subcultured in multi-well culture plates, where they showed exponential cell growth until day 16. Nine (17%) patients released low numbers of MC into the effluent and MC could not be cultured to subconfluence. One additional patient released and apparently adequate number of MC that repeatedly failed to reach confluence. Patients showed the same behavior in several cultures performed. In conclusion, peritoneal MC released into peritoneal effluent are accessible for profound analysis by a culture technique. This technique opens the possibility of serial follow-up of the biology of MC individual PD patients.</dc:description>
