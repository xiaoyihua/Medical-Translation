<dc:description xml:lang="en">A zoometric and yield study of the domestic Salvadorean hog in its three representative types: "chino" or beardless (CH), "negro" or black (N) and "parchado" or patched (P) in the birth-to-sacrifice stages, as well as in the carcasses, was carried out. All live animals were weighed, and shoulder height, perimeter of thorax and length of dorsal arch measurements were taken and daily average gains, evaluated. Comparison between the pure domestic hog and those crossed with specialized breeds is also established in animals studied from birth to 21 days old; crossed hogs proved to be superior to the domestic animals. Weights of the different commercial parts of the animal such as head, ducts, bacon, skin and main organs (entrails) were taken from sacrificed hogs (carcass). Dorsal fat was measured as well, and animals with a control diet and those consuming a free diet are compared. Projections are also made with the daily gains and commercial yields of animals weighing 110, 130, 150, 170 and 190 pounds at sacrifice, and of the mean zootechnic characteristic values. Statistical analysis of data pertaining to animals fed the free diet revealed differences among types (p less than 0.05) in regard to duct weight (CH and N superior to P), fat weight (N inferior to P and CH), head weight (P inferior to CH and N), weight of skin (CH inferior to P and N), length of body (CH superior to N and P) and perimeter of thorax (CH superior to P and N).</dc:description>
