<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Improvement of surgical techniques, innovation, and technological development have increased the frequency of cesarean section. OBJECTIVE To identify the sociodemographics, obstetrical, attention and medical practice factors of risk most frequently associated to cesarean section. PATIENTS AND METHOD From January to June 2007, we carried out a study of cases and controls with 222 cases of cesarean section and 358 controls of vaginal childbirth in Hospital General no. 6 of Ciudad Juárez. We compared frequency of sociodemographics, obstetrical, attention, and medical practice variables, by means of chi2 and Fisher exact tests; association among these variables and cesarean section was considered with odds ratio. In all cases chosen confidence interval was 95%. RESULTS Risk factors associated with cesarean section were: maternal age over 28 years, previous cesarean section, complicated pregnancy, fetal suffering, cephalopelvic disproportion, deficient prenatal care; fetal podalic version, oxytocin administration, abnormal amniotic fluid, double- or triple-circle umbilical cord; patient attended by a gynecologist with more than 16 years of experience and by a resident; and medical care in evening shift. There was no association with age, menarche, beginning of sexual relationships, body mass index, smoking, or addictions. CONCLUSIONS Risk factors associated with cesarean section were: previous cesarean section and patient attended by a gynecologist with more than 16 years of experience and by a resident.</dc:description>
