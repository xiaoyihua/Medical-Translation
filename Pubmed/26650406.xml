<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the last years, studies of patients' satisfaction in drug abuse treatments have become a valuable tool for assessing the quality of treatment and predicting their outcome. However, no previous research has been found that examine patients' conditions that could predict satisfaction. This study analyzes the relationship between patients' characteristics and their degrees of satisfaction in treatment using a probabilistic sample of 216 patients from institutions specializing in addictions within the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires. Participants complete a questionnaire about their satisfaction with different elements of the treatment. Statistical analysis shows that some patients' variables are associated with different levels of satisfaction. Belonging to the male gender, having a significant other, and having lower levels of education were significantly linked with greater satisfaction. Fewer amounts of substances consumed as well as fewer substances that motivated the reason for consultation were associated with a higher degree of satisfaction. The results show the importance of assessing these existing features when designing treatments to suit the specific needs of patients; to seek higher levels of satisfaction, and ultimately, better overall results.</dc:description>
