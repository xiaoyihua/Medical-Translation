<dc:description xml:lang="en">Increases in the rates of fungal infections, as well as their associated morbidity and mortality has led to a need for additional antifungal agents. The most common serious fungal agents in immunosuppressed and critically ill patients are Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp., although other emerging fungi must be considered. Rational, early systemic antifungal treatment should be based on diagnostic imaging techniques and conventional mycological and non-culture-based procedures. While the availability of new therapeutic options is an important advance, antifungal therapy has become increasingly complex. In addition to the available antifungal armamentarium, recent research has resulted in the introduction of three new antifungal agents: micafungin, anidulafungin, and posaconazole. This article provides an update, based on the latest scientific evidence, of the clinical efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety and dosing of antifungal drugs administered in the management of Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Cryptococcus spp., Zygomycetes, Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp.</dc:description>
