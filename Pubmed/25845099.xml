<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM Vascular rings are a rare cause of compression of the trachea and/or the esophagus, causing stridor and/or severe dysphagia. We present our experience in the diagnosis and management of vascular rings. METHODS Retrospective study in which we analyzed clinical history, diagnosis and management of 18 patients diagnosed with vascular ring between January 1985 and December 2013. We evaluate endoscopy as a diagnostic method. RESULTS A total of 18 patients were included, with a median age of 2 years. 83.3% (15/18) had some type of symptom: 46.7% (7/15) had respiratory symptoms such as respiratory distress, stridor, recurrent respiratory infections, bronchospasm with wheezing or asthma in older children; 20% (3/15) had digestive symptoms such as dysphagia, vomiting and regurgitation; and 33.3% (5/15) combined respiratory and digestive symptoms. The remaining patients, 16.7% (3/18) were asymptomatic and the diagnosis was casual. The most common types of vascular rings were double aortic arch (27.8%) and aberrant subclavian right artery (27.8%). In 3 cases (16.7%) a Kommerell diverticulum was associated. 44.4% (n = 8) was operated on, the remaining did not present symp- toms which justify the intervention (n = 10). 37.5% of patients had postoperative complications (iatrogenic recurrent paralysis and persistent tracheomalacia). There was no mortality in our series. The median follow-up was 6.4 years. At the moment, 88.9% of patients are asymptomatic, and 33.3% have been definitely discharged. CONCLUSIONS Vascular rings are rare, and usually presented with common symptoms in childhood. Therefore, in front of a longstanding and recurrent respiratory symptoms, or dysphagia, we should think of a vascular ring. Not all subjects are candidates for surgical correction; therefore a multidisciplinary evaluation is essential.</dc:description>
