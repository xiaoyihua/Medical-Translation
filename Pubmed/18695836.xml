<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Primary snoring is characterized by absence of apneas. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by upper respiratory tract obstruction that alters ventilation and sleep. Permanent night snoring is the most important risk factor. OBJECTIVE To know the primary snoring prevalence and OSAS associated symptoms in children of Cordoba. To determine if physicians ask parents about this syndrome and if parents are encouraged to ask about it. POPULATION, MATERIAL AND METHODS Study design was cross-sectional, population was formed by children that assist to health centers of Cordoba, age ranged from 2 to 11 years. A survey was used to detect snoring presence and associated symptoms. Physicians administer the survey to parents and tutors. Snorer was classified in: permanent, usual, and rare snorer. RESULTS 1541 survey, snoring prevalence of 9.47%. We compare the permanent snoring group (PS) against the others (US+RS). 55 children (37,67%) were permanent snorers. 51% present respiratory pauses. 13% was strongly moved during a pause. In 74,6% cases, snoring did not motivated physician visit and in 78,8% physician had not asked about snoring in the patient screening. CONCLUSION We found similar prevalence of snorers than bibliography. 51% of snorer's parents observed respiratory pauses during sleep. Daily and nigthy symptoms presence related to snoring was associated with a meaningfully frequency to the permanent snorers group. It is remarkable the poor importance attributed to this syndrome by physicians and family. It is believed that because of this syndrome frequency, simple diagnosis and solution, physicians should ask about it in patient screening.</dc:description>
