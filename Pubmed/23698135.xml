<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify the factors associated with level of knowledge and attitudes toward research among undergraduate medical students in Peru. METHODS In this analytical cross-sectional study, a validated questionnaire on knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to research was applied to a representative sample of students at 17 Peruvian medical schools. The categorical and quantitative variables were subjected to simple two-factor analysis with adjustment for intraclass correlation. Prevalence ratios were derived on the basis of generalized linear models using bifactorial and multifactorial analysis. RESULTS Questionnaires from 1 554 students (51.0% women) with an average age of 20.5 ± 2.86 years were analyzed. Only 46.7% of the respondents had a good level of knowledge and 37.7% had appropriate attitudes toward research. The variables that correlated with a good level of knowledge were the respondent having completed at least four years of academic study, belonging to a research group, and having an adviser. Having appropriate attitudes toward research correlated with being a woman and having an adviser. No differences were found between the level of knowledge and attitudes of the students at the universities studied. CONCLUSIONS In general, the level of knowledge about research was unsatisfactory and the attitudes toward it were inappropriate. In order to change this situation, it will be critical to make changes in the curriculum to ensure that students engage in research from the beginning of their academic careers and develop research skills in their final years of study.</dc:description>
