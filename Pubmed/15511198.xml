<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To try established antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and frequency of both nosocomial and community-acquired bloodstream infections and and to try identified the prognostic factors that can be modified. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective study of 310 bloodstream infections with clinical significance detected in a non teaching hospital over period from October 2000-2001. A blood culture were identified by Bact-Alert system and the confirmation was performed by MicroScan system; an antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by reference microdilution methods as described by NCCLS. We studied sentinel antimicrobial/organism combinations with potential clinical importance. Data were computerized using SPSS. Qualitative variables were compared using the X2 test or the Fisher exact test, and quantitative variables with t Student or ANOVA. RESULTS Gram positive and Candida were frequently recovered in nosocomial bloodstreams. The proportion of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus isolates was 24% and the penicillin resistant pneumococci was 14%. Vancomycin was universal active against gram positive. Gram negatives were often recovered in community bloodstream. The proportion of EBSL E. coli isolates was &lt; 2% and the proportion of multiresistance Pseudomonas aeruginosa was higher among UCI isolates. An independent risk factors for death identified after multivariate analysis was the inappropriate antimicrobial therapy OR 2.6. CONCLUSIONS Ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and their resistance profiles is essential on local scale and permit the selection of appropriate antibiotic therapy which would be reduce the mortality.</dc:description>
