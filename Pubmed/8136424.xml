<dc:description xml:lang="en">Disorders of the lipoprotein metabolism in diabetic patients are of great interest because their association to the presence of atheromatosis and because cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of mortality in diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to compare the lipidic scheme of our diabetic patients according to the type of diabetes, the age of onset and the evolution over the years, and to analyze the impact of variations in the glycemic control on such lipidic scheme. In the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides were within the recommended values for the age of the patients. There was a significant correlation between glycemia and HbAlc and triglycerides, total cholesterol and its LDL and HDL fractions. In non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, we observed average values of total cholesterol and LDL fraction higher than what is recommended for diabetic patients with the characteristics of this group. There was a significant correlation between basal glycemia, HbAlc and triglycerides, as in the insulin-dependent diabetes, although there was no correlation with total cholesterol and HDL. This absence of correlation may be due to the effect of other factors: age, inadequate dietary follow-up obesity and hyperinsulinism.</dc:description>
