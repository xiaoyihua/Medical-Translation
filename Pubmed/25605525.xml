<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Hospital admissions due to pneumonia range from 1.1 to 4 per 1,000 patients and this figure increases with age. Hospitalization causes a decline in functional status. Physical impairment impedes recovery and constitutes a higher risk of disability and mortality in elderly people. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of hospital stay in patients with pneumonia related with age. METHOD A total of 116 patients with pneumonia were included in this study, and divided into two age groups:&lt;75 years (n=68) and ≥ 75 years (n=48). Respiratory function, physical function and psychological and emotional profile were evaluated. Pneumonia severity, nutritional status, independence and comorbidities were also assessed. RESULTS Statistical analyses revealed significant differences between both age groups in pneumonia severity and comorbidities. Significant improvements between admission and discharge were found in lung function in both groups (p&lt;0.05), while a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in strength assessed by dynamometer was found in the ≥75 years group. CONCLUSION Hospitalization leads to a significant physical impairment in patients admitted for pneumonia. This deterioration increases with age.</dc:description>
