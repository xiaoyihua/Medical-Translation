<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Describe the clinical and tomographic characteristics in relation to the extra peritoneal distribution of collections and air in patients with periampullary perforation after performing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with or without sphincterotomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Observational, descriptive study in patients with periampullary perforation after ERCP with or without sphincterotomy, treated in the Pancreas Surgery Service at Edgardo Rebagliati Martins Hospital, Lima, Peru between January 2013 and January 2015. RESULTS Ten patients with periampullary perforation after ERCP were included. 40% were male. The mean age was 47.2 years. 100% showed abdominal pain, fever 70%, 60% had jaundice, oral intolerance and vomiting. In 100% of cases the description of the procedure was for choledocolithiasis. Difficult cannulation is described in 80% of cases. Air or fluid was found in 90% in the right anterior pararenal space and the right perirenal, and the place where air or liquid is distributed less frequently was right extraperitoneal pelvis with 20%, in no caserevealed air in the mediastinum. CONCLUSIONS The finding of a liquid collection and / or air in the retroperitoneal space right after ERCP without further involvement of the pancreatic gland should make us think of periampullary perforation, especially if you are in the right anterior pararenal space and perirenal space. This entity we call bilioretroperitoneo.</dc:description>
