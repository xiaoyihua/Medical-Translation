<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Micropercutaneous nephrolithotomy is an evolution from the conventional percutaneous surgery in which pyelocaliceal access is obtained through minimum bore holes. Its objective is the complete removal of the calculi, lowering the morbidity associated with larger bore percutaneous tracts. MATERIAL AND METHODS We present the case of a micropercutaneous nephrolithotomy performed in a 14-year-old female patient with a 35 mm diameter kidney stone located in the renal pelvis. Surgery was performed in the Galdakao-modified supine Valdivia position. Puncture was done under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance. The 4.85 Ch needle of the Microperc(®) set was used, completing the procedure through the 8 Ch working shaft. Lasertripsy was done with the Ho:YAG laser. An indwelling double J stent was placed at the end of the procedure. RESULTS Operating time was 170 minutes. Hospital stay was one day. She suffered renal colic after 72 hours, which was resolved with oral analgesic treatment at home (Clavien I). She returned to school on the fifth postoperative day. The double J was removed at 2 weeks. At one month of the surgery, the patient is asymptomatic, a 4mm lower calyx residual stone being observed in the abdominal ultrasound. CONCLUSION Micropercutaneous nephrolithotomy is a step forward towards the search for a less invasive kidney stone treatment. It is a safe and effective technique in the pediatric population, and it can be performed in the supine position, even in orthotropic kidneys. Future studies and collaborative works will help to better define its indications, to optimize its technique and to analyze its cost-effectiveness compared with other treatment options.</dc:description>
