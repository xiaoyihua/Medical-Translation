<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Identifying the factors correlated with health-related quality of life (QOL) amongst low-income diabetic patients attending two public hospitals in Bogotá. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study involving 153 type 2 diabetic patients. The variables studied were socio-demographic characteristics, social support, lifestyle and clinical measurements (HbA1c, BMI, and cholesterol). The SF-8 health survey (8-item short form) was used for assessing health-related QOL. RESULTS Overall physical score was 41.4 (SE 8.5) and overall mental score 46.5 (SE 7.3); the scores never exceeded 50 points. The factors correlated with lower QOL regarding the physical domain were occupation, social support, physical activity and fat intake and age, occupation, social support, and smoking status regarding the mental domain. CONCLUSIONS The patients surveyed here had a poor QOL. The factors correlated with health-related QOL included socio-demographic characteristics, social support and lifestyle. These findings should be taken into account when formulating public health policy to readdress the current healthcare model for controlling diabetes.</dc:description>
