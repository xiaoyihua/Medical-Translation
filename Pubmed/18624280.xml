<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE The prominent ear is a frequent problem that can be a source of important psychosocial troubles. The aim of this paper has been to evaluate the psychosocial repercussion, cosmetic result and degree of satisfaction in patients treated at our Institution for prominent ears in the last 4 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS A questionnaire has been sent to 127 patients. All of them underwent Mustarde's otoplasty. RESULTS 238 otoplasty were performed in 127 patients (87% bilateral procedures). The mean age was 8.15 +/- 3.25 years (range: 1-15 years), with a follow-up of 27.15 +/- 13.62 months (range: 4-52 months). Sixty-two % of the patients underwent otoplasty without having self-image affected while 38% of the group were patients older enough to see surgery to correct a long-standing defect. Patients did not require a period of postoperative psychosocial adjustment to their new appearance. Two patients described their results of surgery as little improvement. Three undergo partial recurrence and 5 suffered from total recurrence. All of the patients resume their lives with an improved level of self confidence. Conclusions. Otoplasty is a safe procedure for prominent ears to be considered in children with psycosocial, emotional or behavioural effects.</dc:description>
