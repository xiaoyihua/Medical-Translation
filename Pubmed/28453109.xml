<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective To detect the presence or absence of transgenic proteins derived from GM crops in maize flour marketed in Bogota D.C., Colombia. Methods 11 extraction protocols for total protein were evaluated in 17 precooked flour, two uncooked and three positive controls. Subsequently, the presence of 7 transgenic proteins (CP4-EPSPS, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1F, Cry2A, Cry34Ab1 and Cry3Bb1) using commercial ELISA kits was determined. Results It was determined that the best protocol for total protein extraction was buffer with Triton X-100, which allowed obtaining protein concentrations greater than 0.5 mg per gram of flour and does not generate interference with the ELISA technique. Four transgenic proteins were detected: CP4EPSPS, Cry1F, Cry1Ab and Cry34Ab1 in precooked and uncooked flour with percentages varying between 20 and 100 %. Conclusion Seven of the 19 maize flours contain traces of transgenic protein (B2,B8,A3,O3,O1,C1 and C2) that provide resistance to lepidopterans and coleopterans, and tolerance to glyphosate herbicide, (CP4EPSPS- Cry1Ab, Cry1F, Cry34Ab1 and Cry3Bb1). All detected events are approved for human consumption in Colombia, according to the Ministry of Health and Social Protection.</dc:description>
