<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE to evaluate the usefulness of a simple, rapid, qualitative technique (MedMira Rapid Test) to detect antibodies against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and compare this approach with an immunometric technique in patients with chronic hepatitis C infected with different genotypes. METHODS anti-HCV antibodies were determined with the MedMira rapid technique and an immunometric method in samples from 138 patients with chronic hepatitis C infected with different HCV genotypes, and in 50 samples from healthy individuals. RESULTS the MedMira rapid technique detected anti-HCV antibodies in 135 (98%) of 138 serum samples from patients with chronic hepatitis C, whereas the immunometric method gave positive results in all 138 samples. Three of the 138 anti-HCV-positive samples identified with the immunometric method and confirmed by inmunoblotting were repeatedly negative with the MedMira rapid technique. Two of these samples were genotype 1 and the third was not genotyped. All samples from the control group were negative for anti-HCV antibodies by both methods. The sensitivity and specificity of the MedMira rapid technique relative to the immunometric technique were 98% and 100% respectively. CONCLUSION the MedMira rapid technique is a quick, specific and sensitive method that is easy to use by nonspecialized personnel, and is a good alternative to other, slower methods for the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C.</dc:description>
