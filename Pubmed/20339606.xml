<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE This study was aimed at analysing the long-term effects of weight-loss on mortality. METHODS Studies available in the Pubmed database regarding the effect of weight-loss on mortality were analysed. Possible causes for inconsistencies amongst different studies and the biological rationale for the available evidence were studied. RESULTS Most studies have suggested that being overweight and obesity are common risk factors for chronic diseases. However, most studies have also suggested that, independently of weight, a change in weight (increase or reduction) increases the risk of mortality when compared to maintaining a stable weight. CONCLUSION The beneficial or adverse effect of weight-loss on mortality could depend on individuals' genetic characteristics, pre- and post-natal background, initial weight, the amount of weight lost, the time taken to lose weight and the strategies used for reducing weight.</dc:description>
