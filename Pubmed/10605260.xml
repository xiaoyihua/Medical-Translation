<dc:description xml:lang="en">Information sources are the books, journals and electronic systems which support the academic work of physicians. Doctors have not taken enough advantage of these sources for their clinical decisions because they trend to rely on a routine undue confidence in experience, and because they do not have the skills for so-called health documentation. Many patients, consequently, have access to the best alternatives for solving their medical problems. The proper use of these sources implies some skills such as reflexive practice, the ability for recovering information, and critical reading and enough determination to apply the results of scientific research to individual patients, taking into consideration the patient's circumstances and the evaluation of outcomes. In this way, there is real integration of medical care, research, and continuing medical education.</dc:description>
