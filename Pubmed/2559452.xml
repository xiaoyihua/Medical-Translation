<dc:description xml:lang="en">Four cases of familial polyposis coli (FPC), seen at Dr. Manuel Gea González General Hospital from 1985 to 1987, are presented. Three females and one male, with ages ranging between 23 and 52 years, are presented. The clinical picture included bloody feces, polyp prolapse, and a maxillary osteoma. In 3 cases the correct preoperative diagnosis was made by rectosigmoidoscopy, biopsy and barium enema. In one patient, urgently operated on, the diagnosis was postoperatively made by colonoscopy. The adenocarcinoma of the colon appeared associated with FPC in three cases (one of the mucinous variety). One total coloproctectomy and two abdominal colectomies with ileorectal anastomosis were performed. One patient operated on because of bowel obstruction was treated by right hemicolectomy. This case developed abdominal carcinomatosis afterwards. One woman died; another one was lost during follow-up, and the other one had no complications. The association of FPC and mucinous adenocarcinoma of the colon is reported for the first time.</dc:description>
