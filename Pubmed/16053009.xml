<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Vascular diseases are the first cause of mortality within the occidental world. In Spain, they represent 35.5% within the total of deceases. Vascular diseases, jointly with Diabetic Nephropaty, are the first cause of inclusion of patients in dialysis. In precocious stages of renal disease, and as a consequence of the inflammatory condition generated already exists vascular damage. But its prevention is difficult, because habitually GFR is evaluated by means of plasmatic creatinin rate impeding the suitable detection of renal disease prevailing. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevailing of Occult Chronic Kidney Disease (OCKD) and its association with conventional vascular risk factors (VRF). MATERIAL AND METHODS The epidemiologic study was made in a randomly selected population elder than 18 years. GFR was calculated using Cockcroft-Gault and MDRD methods, and the results were correlated with VRF. RESULTS The studied population mean age is 50.49 +/- 16.28 years, hypertension prevailing is 31.5%, diabetes: 7.5%, obesity: 21.9%, dislipènic: 35.62%, anemia: 1.4%. IV degree IRCO rate (GFR: 15-30 ml/min) is 0.7 (MDRD) with 69.43 +/- 12.58 years of age, and 1.5% (C-G) with 76.25 +/- 10.64 years of age. GFR, independently on the method used in its calculation, is significantly correlated with TAS (&lt; 0.0001), pulse pressure (&lt; 0.0001), Hb (0.0001), obesity (&lt; 0.0001), Total Cholesterol (&lt; 0.0001), triglycerides (&lt; 0.0018), c-HDL (&lt; 0.0001), c-LDL (&lt; 0.0001) e hiperuricemic (&lt; 0.0001). GFR disparity depends on the equation used. It could be explained because C-G overestimate by "weigh" and it has higher deviation in lower renal function values. Whereas, using MDRD equation there is an overestimation by "age" and it has lower variability. CONCLUSIONS In an aged population, the prevailing of OCKD and the rate of VRF are high conferring high vascular risk. It will be necessary to adopt intervention measures in order to avoid renal disease progress and its high morbid-mortality.</dc:description>
