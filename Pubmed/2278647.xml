<dc:description xml:lang="en">The following is a preliminary report on 29 patients with mucoviscidosis. The study was conducted within the hospital and included clinical history, laboratory examinations and X-rays. The patient's ages ranged from four months to 20 years; 15 of them were males, 22 of them began their illness with respiratory symptomatology, 24 of them were previously hospitalized on one or more occasions. Bronchial secretions were examined for pathological and opportunistic bacteria. Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus predominated and were found to be highly resistant to antibiotics. Mortality was high among the group: 13.7%.</dc:description>
