<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The use of de-epithelialized intestinal segment can avoid the complications associated of use to bowel segments for bladder augmentation. OBJECTIVE We designed an experimental model New Zealand rabbit with previously reduced bladder capacity, and afterward we performed augmentation cystoplasty with urodynamics comparative effectiveness demucosalized and conventional colocystoplasty techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS In thirty-six male New Zealand rabbits fifty percent reduction cystoplasty was carried out. A month later the animals had bladder augmentation. They were randomly divided in two groups: 18 rabbits (group 1) underwent conventional colocystoplasty. In 18 rabbits (group 2) autoaugmentation procedure and demucosalized colocystoplasty was performed. All animals were sacrificed at 8 weeks of bladder augmentation. Urodynamics studies were practiced at beginning of each operation in all of them. RESULTS Nine rabbits died and twenty-seven were evaluated: 14 rabbits group-1 and thirteen of group-2. The average increase in bladder capacity was 63% in group-1 under conventional colocystoplasty and 17% in group-2 demucosalized colocystoplasty. Average compliance improved to 141% in group-1 and 38% in group-2. CONCLUSIONS In this study with "small bladder" New Zealand rabbit, the seromuscular colocystoplasty has poor urodynamics result in improving capacity and compliance bladder but conventional colocystoplasty has result effective.</dc:description>
