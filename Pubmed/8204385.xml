<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors report a case of carcinoma arising in a longstanding Zenker's diverticulum, in a 66 years old man that refused surgical treatment for 25 years. Three months prior to his admission to our hospital, an exacerbation of his dysphagia, which became severe, was observed; and so was regurgitation, with passage to the airway during swallowing or when asleep. The esophagram showed the diverticulum without images suggestive of neoplasm, and with spilling of barium into the tracheobronchial tree. Esophagoscopy was refused by the patient. After surgical diverticulectomy, a thickened area in the inferior portion of the diverticular body was observed, which was histologically reported as a squamous cell carcinoma with pearl formation, involving only the diverticular wall. Complementary radiotherapy with TCT was administered over the esophagus, mediastinum and supraclavicular lymphatic areas, with a total dose of 5000 Cgy. Concomitant chemotherapy with Mitomycin and 5-Fluorouracil was administered. After a 2 year follow-up, the patient is completely asymptomatic. We discuss etiopathogenic factors, clinical manifestations, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic possibilities.</dc:description>
