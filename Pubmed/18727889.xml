<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To present our early experience in the treatment of primary malignant and metastatic lung lesions by radiofrequency ablation. PATIENTS AND METHODS From August 2004 through January 2007 we treated 19 patients (in 26 procedures) with curative or palliative intent. None of the lesions was amenable to surgery and some had been treated previously. The procedure was performed in the radiology room under conscious sedation-analgesia administered by an anesthesiologist. Fourteen patients were treated for pulmonary lesions and 5 for metastatic lung disease in a context of controlled primary disease. Treatment was with curative intent in 15 cases and palliative in 4. RESULTS The radiofrequency technique was applicable in 26 procedures and the mean follow-up was 8.68 months. The principal complications of radiofrequency treatment were pneumothorax in 4 patients, requiring drainage in only 2 cases; pneumonitis in 4; self-limiting pulmonary hemorrhage in 1; and pleural effusion in 5. There were no procedure-related deaths. Six patients died during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, radiofrequency offers a safe and minimally invasive option for the treatment of malignant lung lesions in appropriately selected, nonsurgical patients. Morbidity is low, and in combination with other treatments this technique opens up a wide range of possibilities still to be explored.</dc:description>
