<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Metabolic syndrome consists of a group of factors that predict the risk of having an acute cardiovascular event. Some of these factors increase the risk of myocardial infarction and are also associated with the severity of cardiovascular events. The objective was to determine the influence of factors associated with metabolic syndrome, and especially abdominal obesity, on the size of coronary events, estimated by the concentration of total creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and CPK-MB isoenzyme (CPK-MB). SUBJECTS AND METHOD We performed a cross-sectional study of 40 men diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome. We collected clinical data (age, history of diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension ) and anthropometric data [body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHR)]. CPK and CPK-MB concentrations were measured to determine the maximum concentration reached in order to estimate the size of the myocardial infarction area. RESULTS The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 30%. Approximately 84% of the patients were overweight and 42% had abdominal obesity. A positive association was found between myocardial enzymes and anthropometric parameters (BMI, WC, WHR). The variable showing the closest association with the size of myocardial infarction was central obesity [total CPK, r (Pearson) = 0.47; p&lt;0.003] and (CPK-MB, r= 0.4; p&lt;0.01). Metabolic syndrome was not a predictive factor for the size of myocardial necrosis (beta=-0.29; p&lt;0.1). Multiple regression analysis showed that WC predicted maximal total CPK (beta=37.15; 95% CI, 9.16-65.15; p&lt;0.01) and CPK-MB concentrations (beta=5.7; 95% CI, -0.4-11.9; p&lt; 0.06) after an acute coronary event. CONCLUSIONS The presence of abdominal obesity was associated with greater myocardial necrosis size after an acute coronary event.</dc:description>
