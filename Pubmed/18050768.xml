<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mechanized procedure for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence. Retropubic fixation of the vagina with a stapler specifically designed, using the pubis' symphysis as the site for anchoring. We intend to demonstrate the physiopathologic rationale to achieve continence by anchoring the urethra. In our elementary conditions for research and development we could not design the suitable procedure, although the idea was presented to international companies. We summarize the development of the instrument until it was operative, filming one operation which was presented to the Hispanic-American Congress in Madrid 1992. The instrument was patented in the Spanish Office of Patents and Trademarks in July 1992 with the category of invention patent because there were no previous mechanized procedures for vaginal fixation.</dc:description>
