<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the social cost and burden of depression in the city of Sabadell (Barcelona, Spain) in 2007 and 2008. METHOD The social cost of depression was calculated using the prevalence approach, based on information obtained in the development of the European Project Against Depression (EAAD). The results referred to the cost of public resources used, and the sources came from the appropriate official registers. RESULTS The direct public cost of depression in the city of Sabadell was € 9,155,620 in 2007 and € 9,304,706 in 2008. The relative weight of primary care visits and the use of drugs accounted for more than 85% of direct costs. In the section of indirect costs, the cost of permanent work disability could not be obtained. Indirect costs amounted to € 9,720,225 in 2007 and € 9,763,541 in 2008. In both years, the highest weight corresponded to temporary work disability reaching € 8,561,962 and € 7,333,181, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Depression has a substantial economic impact on the health system because it is associated with high direct public costs. However, the lack of knowledge of the cost associated with permanent work disability is a major limitation, as this cost category represents the highest percentage for this disorder.</dc:description>
