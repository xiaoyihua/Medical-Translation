<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess the referrals made by pediatricians for microbiological diagnoses and to evaluate the process by determining the index of contaminated urine samples. PATIENTS AND METHODS A transverse retrospective study was carried out on the referrals made to the microbiology laboratory of the University Hospital in Salamanca during 1997. The study was limited to the health area of Salamanca, which covers a population of 358,408 inhabitants. The data are distributed according to care levels and referral indicators (proportions and indices) are elaborated. RESULTS The referrals and results of the 65,462 samples that were processed during this period were analyzed. Of the total, 10,120 (28%) were positive. The overall rate of pediatric referrals was 533 per 1,000 inhabitants. The highest demand was for serology, urinary and fecal studies. The rate of positive results in the different pediatric samples was 156/1000. The rate of results in urine was 154/1000. The rate of contaminated urine samples was 92/1000. CONCLUSIONS The types of microbiological analyses in greatest demand are serology and urine cultures. The relationship between referrals and positive results is 4:1. The quality of the process can be improved through patient instruction and by means of suitable sample collection and transport.</dc:description>
