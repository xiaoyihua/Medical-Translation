<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Information on the association of lung cancer (LC) and combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) is limited and derived almost exclusively from series in Asian populations. The main objective of the study was to assess the impact of LC on survival in CPFE patients and in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). METHODS A retrospective study was performed with data from patients with CFPE and IPF diagnosed in our hospital over a period of 5 years. RESULTS Sixty-six patients were included, 29 with CPFE and 37 with IPF. Nine had a diagnosis of LC (6 with CPFE and 3 with IPF). Six patients (67%) received palliative treatment even though 3 of them were diagnosed atstage i-ii. Overall mortality did not differ significantly between groups; however, in patients with LC, survival was significantly lower compared to those without LC (P=.044). The most frequent cause of death was respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary fibrosis exacerbation (44%). In a multivariate analysis, the odds ratio of death among patients with LC compared to patients without LC was 6.20 (P=.037, 95% confidence interval: 1.11 to 34.48). CONCLUSIONS Lung cancer reduces survival in both entities. The diagnostic and therapeutic management of LC is hampered by the increased risk of complications after any treatment modality, even after palliative treatment.</dc:description>
