<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE This research analyzes the direct and indirect relationships among self-motivation, perceived competition and psychological well-being and ill-being. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data from 491 Spanish college students (299 men and 192 women) who practice sports were collected using a cross-sectional design. Statistical analyses were carried out using structural equation modeling. RESULTS Psychological well-being was directly fostered by perceived competition and indirectly by self- motivation. Furthermore, perceived competition was negatively associated with psychological ill-being. CONCLUSIONS Perceived competition and self-motivation are important to the psychological well-being of college students and to avoiding ill-being.</dc:description>
