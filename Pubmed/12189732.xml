<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The first Surgery Ambulatory Unit was created in 1990, at the Hospital de Viladecans although in 1982 Polo et al. had commenced a programme of strictly ambulatory surgery. The Spanish Services of Urology are going to be incorporated to this new style of labour, and, by the moment, with excellent results. MATERIAL AND METHODS We realize a description of the functioning of our service inside the Unit of Ambulatory Major Surgery, and a descriptive analysis of our activity in above mentioned unit since February 2000(creation date) to May 2001. RESULTS 118 patients were operated, being 15% women and 85% men. The most frequent surgery done were: hydrocelectomy, orchiopexy, varicocelectomy, vesical distensions, Nesbit technique and internal urethrotomy. From the whole of the patients, none was increased, and the complication tax was similar to the conventional surgery patients. This kind of surgery suppose 17% in 2000 and 19% in 2001 of the whole of surgery, with clear increasing tendency in the last months. CONCLUSIONS The Ambulatory Major Surgery is an effective and efficient care pattern in which Urology Services are included, so that the degree of satisfaction of the patients and the quality offered is similar to the inpatient surgery.</dc:description>
