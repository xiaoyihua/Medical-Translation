<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze gender- and age-related motivations among smokers wishing to quit. METHODS We performed a multicenter cross-sectional study in 1,634 smokers attended by general practitioners and specialized physicians in Spain who, after being explicitly asked about their intention to quit smoking, expressed a desire to do so. Sociodemographic data, history of smoking and motivations for cessation were collected. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS The mean age was 45.6 years (SD+/-12.0 years). Fifty-six percent were men. A total of 35.2% had studied beyond high school. The main motivation expressed by 63.9% of men and 81.1% of smokers older than 60 years old was medical advice; 60.7% of women were motivated by disease prevention; 31.5% of smokers aged between 31 and 45 years old wanted to be a good role model for their children and 11.4% of those aged between 18 and 30 were motivated by esthetic reasons. CONCLUSIONS Men tend to be motivated by medical advice, while women are motivated by a desire to be a role model for their children, to prevent diseases or improve their appearance. The greater the age, the greater the percentage of patients motivated by medical advice. Middle-aged adults want to be good role models for their children while young patients are motivated by esthetic concerns.</dc:description>
