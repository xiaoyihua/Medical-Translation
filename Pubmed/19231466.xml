<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The local exeresis adenocarcinoma of the rectum T(2)N(0)M(0) (ADC-T2), using transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), has the benefit of achieving lower morbidity with a better quality of life. However, local occurrence of the local exeresis is greater than 20%, which is unacceptable these days. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospective, observational follow up study. The tumours committee agreed that those ADC-T2 patients could have the following treatments: total mesorectal excision (TME), simple TEM, TEM with postoperative chemo- and radiotherapy (Ct-Rt), preoperative Ct-Rt with subsequent TEM and radical surgical rescue (TME) within at least 4 weeks. RESULTS Of the 146 patients operated on using TEM, 75 had adenocarcinomas, 59 adenomas, 6 scarring wounds, 5 carcinoids and 1 GIST. Of the adenocarcinomas 22 were ADC-T2. Follow up: median of 16 months (range, 3-32 months). The overall local recurrence was 18% (4/22). According to the treatment strategy the local occurrence was: TEM as the only procedure, 20% (2/10). Radical surgical rescue was performed on 3 patients after TEM, with no local or systemic recurrences. TEM with Qt-Rt after surgery was performed on 6 patients, with a local recurrence of 33% (2/6). Ct-Rt and subsequent TEM in 3 patients, with no local or systemic recurrences. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of ADC-T2 using simple TEM is not effective. The combination of Ct-Rt after TEM, does not improve the results of TME. It is possible to rescue those patients without changing the overall survival. Preoperative Ct-Rt and TEM appears to be the approach that obtains a clinical and histological response, although a response is needed by clinical trials.</dc:description>
