<dc:description xml:lang="en">The etiology of PMS has not yet been defined, although there are several theories among which it is reported that there is an increase in prolactine levels involved in it. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a dopamine receptor agonist (lisuride maleate), in the treatment of PMS. 35 patients between 19 and 35 years old were recruited in a prospective study design, with diagnosis of PMS and no other gynecological disorder ruled out clinical and ultrasonographic examination, women with no previous treatment and with no use of hormonal agents, these patients were treated for three months with lisuride maleate, 0.3 mg-day in a three dosage scheme per day, the following symptoms were evaluated: headaches, mastalgia, bloating, edema of lower extremities and myalgia in legs, as well as hormonal parameters before and after treatment with estrogens, progesterone, prolactine, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone, which were prescribed in the luteal phase (day 21). Results obtained were: reduction of all symptoms scores versus pretreatment: Headache from 85.7 to 20%, mastalgia from 91.4 to 25%, bloating from 74.2 to 40%, edema in lower extremities from 85.7 to 30%, myalgia in legs, from 61 to 34%. The hormonal profile only showed changes in FSH, since the basal pretreatment level was found in 18.6 and the post-treatment value was 13.86, progesterone from 2.7 to 4.6 and prolactine from 7.74 to 6.82. We conclude the lisuride maleate is a good option to the PMS treatment, since a significative reduction of symptoms are induced and it is well tolerated.</dc:description>
