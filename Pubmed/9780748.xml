<dc:description xml:lang="en">With the aim of obtaining information as to whether the desire to lose weight responds to criteria of health, or whether this is only a question of esthetics, the relation between the body mass index (BMI) as an indicator of obesity, and some attitudes with respect to weight, were analyzed in a group of 254 apparently healthy women between the ages of 14 and 55 with a variety of occupations (students, housewives, and women working outside the home), using a questionnaire designed for the study. An analysis was also made of the types of methods used for the voluntary loss of weight, as well as other aspects of slimming. The sample was classified into three groups according to the BMI: low weight (BMI &lt; 20 kg/m2), adequate weight (BMI = 20-25 kg/m2), and overweight (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2). Of the total number of women studied, only 42% were satisfied with their weight. Of those with a low weight, 35% manifested discontent, and of these, 69% wanted to lose weight and only 19% had attempted to increase it. Among the women with and adequate BMI, 71% indicated not being content with their weight, with 95% wishing to reduce it. In the group of overweight women only 13% were satisfied and all the rest expressed a desire for losing weight. The size and volume of the thighs (28%), hips (22%), buttocks (20%), and abdomen (19%) were the areas producing the greatest amount of discontent. The most common methods for losing weight were: no snacking between meals (54%), physical exercise (53%), and low calorie diets (33%). Only 19% went to see a specialist. The use of laxatives (1.5%) and other slimming products (3.5%) was minimal.</dc:description>
