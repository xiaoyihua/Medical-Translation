<dc:description xml:lang="en">The tuberous breast is a malformation that affects adolescent women uni- or bilaterally, becoming apparent at puberty with the growth of the breast. It is characterised by an alteration of the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the breast, which is translated into a lack of development of the breast and into the herniation of the glandular tissue within the areola with hypertrophy of the latter. Numerous terms have been employed to describe this deformity, besides that of tuberous breast: tubular breast, caprine breast, areolar hernia, hypoplasia of the lower pole or constricted breast. At its most developed degree it is a serious deformity, which affects the emotional stability of the patient in an important way, altering their relational life. Surgical treatment varies depending on the degree and severity of the deformity and includes procedures such as: glandular remodelling, augmentation mammoplasty, mastopexy or a combination of both.</dc:description>
