<dc:description xml:lang="en">HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets) represents a severe form of preeclampsia associated with serious maternal and fetal morbidities and even death. Usually HELLP syndrome appears during the evolution of a severe preeclampsia; however HELLP syndrome can have atypical clinical manifestations. We report a 22-year-old female who consulted at 20 weeks of pregnancy for lumbar pain, dysuria and fever. A urinalysis revealed the presence of white blood cells. The patient was admitted to hospital and treated with antimicrobials. Forty eight hours after admission a proteinuria of 440 mg/24 h was detected. A severe pre eclampsia-HELLP syndrome was diagnosed. However the patient remained with normal blood pressure. An elevation of liver enzymes and creatinine were observed. Five days later fetal death was confirmed and an abortion was induced. The patient required a platelet transfusion. Four days after the abortion, the patient was discharged in good conditions.</dc:description>
