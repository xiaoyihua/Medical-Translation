<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The percentage of women immigrants in Spain has increased in these last years, resulting in the emergence of specific needs related to sexual and reproductive health. The objective of this article was to define the contraceptive methods used by immigrant women and the determining factors that influence their choice. To estimate the use of emergency post-coital contraception and prevalence of abortion. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional study using a survey was carried out in the first quarter of 2011 at the "Centro de Salud Delicias Sur" in Zaragoza, Spain. The target population were immigrant women of childbearing age between 15 and 45 years who attended the clinic. Non probability sampling was used. RESULTS The mean age was 29.35 years (95% confidence interval (CI) = 27.95 to 30.75 years). The majority country of origin was Ecuador. Almost half the women were single and worked in paid employment. The educational level was considered as average. The average duration of residence in Spain was 5.68 years (95% CI = 4.99 to 6.37 years) and 42% of them (95% CI = 32.62 to 51.83) did not use any contraceptive method. The most used contraceptive method was the condom, followed by oral hormonal contraceptives. More than half of the women had been informed in Primary Care. Almost one third (32%) (95% CI = 23.42 to 41.60) of the women had a history of abortion. More than 19% of women (95% CI = 12.46 to 28.10) had used the emergency contraceptive method. CONCLUSION Contraceptive methods were not used by 42% of women. The alert indicators on the failure of preventive measures in sexual health are still too high.</dc:description>
