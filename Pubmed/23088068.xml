<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND According to several studies from around the globe, the modified Misgav Ladach technique simplifies the surgical procedure for cesarean section, reduces operation time, costs, and complications, and optimizes obstetric and perinatal outcomes. OBJECTIVE Compare obstetric outcomes between patients operated on using traditional cesarean section technique and those operated on using modified Misgav Ladach technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included 49 patients operated on using traditional cesarean section technique and 47 patients operated on using modified Misgav Ladach technique to compare the outcomes in both surgical techniques. RESULTS The modified Misgav Ladach technique was associated with more benefits than those of the traditional technique: less surgical bleeding, less operation time, less analgesic total doses, less rescue analgesic doses and less need of more than one analgesic drug. CONCLUSION The modified Misgav Ladach surgical technique was associated with better obstetric results than those of the traditional surgical technique; this concurs with the results reported by other national and international studies.</dc:description>
