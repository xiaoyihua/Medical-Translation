<dc:description xml:lang="en">The patient was an 18 month old female showing a mass in the right upper quadrant. At the examination, in epigastrium and right hypochondrium, a soft tumor mass embodied to the liver was felt. The patient was operated after laboratory studies including an hepatogram were done, but without having determined alpha phetoglobulin. A 15 X 15 cms. spherical mass was found forming body with the left lobe of the liver and was removed together with the lobe. The pathological diagnosis was of hepatocarcinoma, according to ishak and Glunz's classification. All this leads to comment how interesting is the determination of serological tests for alpha phetoglobulins as a measure to aid in the diagnosis. Likewise, the surgical management carried out is a determinant measure for the treatment of these tumors. At present, survivals up to 6 years may be offered. The reason why this case is reported is because hepatocarcinoma is very uncommon at this age.</dc:description>
