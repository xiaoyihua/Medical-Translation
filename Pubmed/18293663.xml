<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine risk factors associated to Burnout Syndrome in medical gynecologist staff who works at the Gynecology-pediatrics with Family Medicine Hospital number 31 of the IMSS at Mexicali city, Baja California. MATERIAL AND METHOD A cross sectional study was performed in 27 gynecologists (100% of the total gynecologist that works at that particular hospital). A validated survey instrument developed by Maslach was applied to them in order to identify the presence of the syndrome and a general questionnaire including sociodemographic information was also applied to the doctors. The statistical analysis was both descriptive and inferential including chi square, Student t and logistic regression. RESULTS 74.1% of the doctors who showed signs of Burnout Syndrome were males and 25.9% were females. The average doctors age of the group who developed Burnout was 44.81 +/- 6.11 years. The mean time in years of work for the doctors with the syndrome was 15.56 +/- 7.11 years. Only one doctor was divorced and she presented Burnout Syndrome, on the other hand, 62.5% of the married doctors showed evidence of Burnout Syndrome (p &gt; 0.05). The general prevalence was 59.2%. Of those who showed signs of burnout, 87.5% presented it in low degree, 6.2% presented moderate degree, 6.2% presented high burnout degree. Out of all the organizational factors type, none resulted significative. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of the reported syndrome is apparently high when compared to the medical anesthesiology staff of the same hospital; however this difference is not statistically significative. In the unvaried and multivariate analyses, no organizational factor shows significance as a potential risk. It is necessary to consider psychological support to the affected doctors and to value the organization of the service, looking for an administrative reengineering.</dc:description>
