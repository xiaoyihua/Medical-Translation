<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE 1. To recognise the clinico-biological profile of a group of patients diagnosed of polycythaemia vera (PV) in our centre in the last 30 years. 2. To identify the evolutive patterns of haematological transformation. 3. To evaluate the effect of therapy on the survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS The clinical records of 74 patients (median age 62 years, male/female = 0.94, followed-up for 6-357 months, median 64 months) were reviewed. Clinico-biological data at diagnosis, therapy, complications and evolution of the haematological picture were evaluated in each case. The actuarial survival in the series was compared to that of the normal population. RESULTS The clinico-analytical data and diagnostic features were identical to other series reported. Mild increases of bone marrow reticulin was present in two thirds of the cases, overt myelofibrosis being found in only 10% of the patients. Abnormal karyotype was seen in 9% of the patients (11q-, -Y). Phlebotomy was the only treatment in eight cases, without increased incidence of thrombotic phenomena. The remainders received myelosuppressive therapy (32P, busulphan, pipobroman, hydroxyurea, etc.), thrombotic complications appearing in 8 cases and haemorrhagic complications in 4 others. One of these latter patients developed oesophageal carcinoma. The haematological picture evolved into toxic aplastic anaemia in 2 cases; myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MF/MM) in 8; myelodysplastic sindromes (MDS) in 5, three of them RAEB; and acute myelogenous leukaemia in 3 cases, two of them as the final stage of previous MF/MM and MDS/ RAEB. The actuarial survival was 71% at ten years and 46% at fifteen years, and the median survival as a whole was 13.5 years. CONCLUSIONS 1: The treatment, mostly myelosuppressive, given to these patients attained a survival similar to that of the general population. 2: Of the cases with known evolution, 15.6% developed MF/MM, its incidence being higher in patients treated only with phlebotomy (37%). 3: The incidence of malignant evolution, i.e., to RAEB/AML, amongst those patients followed-up was 10.6%.</dc:description>
