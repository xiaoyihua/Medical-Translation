<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Women's reproductive potential is closely related to nutritional status. Some of the molecules that participate in ovarian regulation are produced in the adipose tissue, and therefore their production is associated with adiposity. OBJECTIVE To determine serum leptin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in infertile women with or without insulin resistance; and to associate these molecules with adiposity. METHODS Thirty-one infertile women were included. Nutritional status was evaluated through clinical and biochemical parameters. Patients were stratified according with their body mass index and the presence of insulin resistance. For statistics, parametric analyses were conducted. RESULTS The prevalence of overweight was 67.5%; high adiposity was present in 92.3% and central distribution of fat in 96.2% of studied women. Hypercholesterolemia was found in 32.3% of patients, hypertriglyceridemia in 25.8%, and 61.3% presented hyperinsulinemia. Overweight women presented lower adiponectin, and higher TNF-alpha and C-reactive protein concentrations, than those with normal body mass index (p &lt; 0.05). Overweight women had also a higher probability for insulin resistance (p = 0.04). These women with insulin resistance presented lower adiponectin and higher C-reactive protein concentrations than non insulin resistance women. Body mass index correlated with leptin (r= 0.41), TNF-alpha (r= 0.41), and C-reactive protein (r= 0.33) concentrations. CONCLUSION The prevalence of overweight, high adiposity, dislipidemias, and IR was high in our population studied. We conclude that adiposity is closely associated with some of the molecules that participate in the reproductive process and that also regulate inflammatory responses.</dc:description>
