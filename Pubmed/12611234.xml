<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The prevalence of gallstones is increased in patients with cirrhosis. However the presence of cirrhosis has been generally considered a relative contraindication to cholecystectomy. AIM To investigate the complications and the outcomes of laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy in patients with cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty seven patients with gallstones with well-documented cirrhosis undergoing cholecystectomy (laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in 35 and open cholecystectomy (OC) in 32), were studied. The mean age was 57.7 + 10.3 years for LC and 58.9 + 11.6 years for OC. In the LC group, 26 were classified as Child-Pugh class A, 8 as Child's B class and 1 as Child's class C. In the OC group, 12 were classified as Child's class A, 15 as Child's B and 5 as Child's C. RESULTS Complications occurred in 4 of 35 (12.3%) LC patients (1 patients was Child A and 3 were B). In the OC group 14 of 32 patients had complications (4 Child A, 7 B and 3 C, 43.7% p &lt; 0.05 as compared with LC group). Three patients in the OC group died (9.4%). Mean hospital stay was 2.8 + 1.9 and 13 + 12 days in LC and OC patients, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS LC has a lower rate of complications than OC and is a reasonable option for Child's class A and B patients with cirrhosis and gallstones.</dc:description>
