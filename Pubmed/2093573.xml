<dc:description xml:lang="en">In recent times, a new relationship has been developed between the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry. Owing to the large economical potential of the latter, a growing pressure has been felt on the medical group, in order to follow the interest of the industrial complex. This pressure is not always located within a ethical niche.
