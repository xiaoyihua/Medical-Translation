<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Trigeminal sensory neuropathy (TSN) is a rare entity characterised by transient sensory disorders in one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve (TN). There are (acute or chronic) idiopathic forms as well as others that are linked to inflammatory, vascular or structural lesions. CASE REPORT We describe the case of a female aged 30 who presented two self limited episodes of left facial hypaesthesia (second branch of the TN), with no other accompanying symptoms and which lasted 3 7 days, with complete resolution. In the study, lupus anticoagulant (LAC) positive was found in two determinations conducted at a six week interval, while the rest of the findings were either negative or within values that were considered to be normal. CONCLUSIONS Following the description of a case of what may be idiopathic TSN, we discuss the possible relation this may have with the positive result for LAC.</dc:description>
