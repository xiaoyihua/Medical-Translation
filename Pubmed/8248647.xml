<dc:description xml:lang="en">A Faculty of Medicine requires that its academics devote an important part of their duties to scientific research. It does not seem possible to perform university teaching without a personal experience in the methods, techniques and practices of scientific research. Notwithstanding, keeping in mind the fundamental importance of medical practice in the training of professors of a Faculty of Medicine, it is possible to consider a clinical teaching staff, to whom scientific research would not be demanded. This staff would coexist with an academic research staff and would have a limited dedication to clinical research. The object of clinical scientific research is mankind and its purpose relates directly to the medical act. As a consequences the responsible should be a physician. This fact implies that the Faculty of Medicine has the responsibility to create an appropriate environment and system to promote training and research in the clinical area as well as in preclinical and basic areas. A doctorate program in medical sciences in proposed as the most suitable method for the development of clinical scientific research and for the training of young researchers in this area of medical knowledge.</dc:description>
