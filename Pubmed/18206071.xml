<dc:description xml:lang="en">This work explores the significance of different types and sources of social support in the short- and middle-term prediction of volunteer permanence. Volunteers ( N = 1362) belonging to 109 different Spanish organizations were surveyed to gather social support data and other information related to factors traditionally associated with sustained volunteerism prediction. In spite of the fact that a relationship between social support and permanence was found, logistic regression analysis showed that social support variables did not appear to be relevant to make this kind of prediction at short term, because the only factors associated with volunteers' permanence in the multivariate model obtained were the volunteers' previous time in the organization, their intention of remaining in service, and their sex and religious attitudes. In contrast, at middle term, social support and, in particular, informational social support from other volunteers was significant, integrating the multivariate model with the other aforementioned factors, except for sex.</dc:description>
