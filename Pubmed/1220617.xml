<dc:description xml:lang="en">The nutritional value and proximate chemical composition of five samples of rice bran taken from different varieties of rice grown in Venezuela was studied. Thiamin, niacin, riboflavin and tryptophan, lysine, methionine and cystine were analyzed. The apparent protein digestibility was between 59 an 74%, and the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) between 1.19 and 2.31. The supplementation with threonine increased the Protein Efficiency Ratio in 12%, but supplementation with tryptophan did not improve it neither alone nor combined with threonine. Combinations with corn and soyflour that simulate formulas for infants showed that there is a protein supplementation in these mixtures. Some combinations with corn, soy flour, and rice bran had the same P.E.R. as casein. The rice bran is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals in these combinations. The results showed that rice bran has potential value for human consumption.</dc:description>
