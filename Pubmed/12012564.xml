<dc:description xml:lang="en">The disinfection of vegetables and fruits is a treatment applied in order to reduce their natural contamination or processes to the product along the different steps of the food chain until its consumption. In the present work the effect of two disinfectants products was studied: grapefruit seed extract (400 ppm) for 10 min and peracetic acid (2000 ppm) for 1 min (action times assayed according to the manufacturer recommendations) and other additional times. The germicidal action was carried out against the natural contaminants of lettuces and strawberries, through the determination of the germicidal efficiency (%). Treated and untreated strawberries were also evaluated for flavor changes through a sensorial difference test, triangular test. None of the assayed products reached the 99.999% destruction of the natural contaminants according to the Chambers test. Peracetic acid was the most effective disinfectant, reaching the highest destruction percentages at a time lower than that for grapefruit seed extract. Sensory analysis showed no significant differences (p = .05) between strawberries with and without disinfection treatments, at the conditions suggested by the manufacturer.</dc:description>
