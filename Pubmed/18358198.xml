<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Porokeratosis is a primary disorder of epidermal keratinization. The term covers several clinical variants that have in common the presence of a cornoid lamella in histological studies. Although porokeratotic lesions may appear anywhere on the skin, genital lesions are uncommon and may occur in cases of generalized porokeratosis with genital involvement or be localized to the genital area. CASE DESCRIPTION We describe a 47-year-old man with a solitary porokeratotic plaque on the scrotum. He had no other lesions at other sites or relevant personal or familial history. DISCUSSION Porokeratosis confined to the genitals is extremely uncommon. Only 23 cases have been reported in the literature. We undertook a clinical, epidemiological, and therapeutic review, compiling the distinctive characteristics of this rare entity.</dc:description>
