<dc:description xml:lang="en">Between February 1989 to August 1991, 184 macrosomic newborns were somatometrically evaluated during their first 12 hours of age (weight above 4000 g and height above 52 cm). They have a longitudinal follow-up at the Growth Clinic, of the National Institute of Perinatology, in Mexico City, during their first two years of age. All the infants without exception were feeding only with breast milk or protein modificative milk. The ablactation were since the four months of age with the same nutritional pattern. The macrosomic newborn maintain a higher velocity of growth, as a logarithmic kind, at the first two years of age with early cephalotoracic inversion, with maintenance of a big corporal pattern. We conclude that is useful to count with specific growth curves for macrosomic infants since their speed and rhythm of growth are different than for the adequate birth and low birth weight infants and even the macrosomic children of diabetic mother.</dc:description>
