<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To present a case of bilateral opercular syndrome after surgery on both cerebral hemispheres. CASE REPORT A girl was studied at 3 years of age because of a benign intracranial tumor in the middle region of the brain. At the age of 5 years, the tumor was partially removed through the right hemisphere. Three years latter, the patient was operated through the left hemisphere because of growth in the tumor to the left side of the brain. After the second operation, the patient showed the complete symptomatology of the bilateral opercular syndrome, which did not change during this year. CONCLUSION This is a case which the presence of a bilateral opercular syndrome seems to be caused by the surgical lesions of both opercular zones.</dc:description>
