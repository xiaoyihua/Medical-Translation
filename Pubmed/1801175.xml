<dc:description xml:lang="en">The centres for medical and psycho-technical examinations in the prevention of traffic accidents: 1480 examinations carried out in the Spanish Red Cross Centre (Valencia). The centres for medical and psycho-technical examinations are included within the field of primary accident prevention, as they participate in the selection of drivers. In this study, we analyze the results of 1480 examinations of applicants for different types of driving licences (first-time and renewals) who applied to this centre during the first quarter of 1989. To this end we have followed the regulations in force set out in Royal Decree 2272/85. Thus, 90.13% were declared TOTALLY FIT, 8.65% PARTIALLY FIT and 1.22% UNFIT to drive. By age groups these percentages vary: in those under 50, there were 95.76% TOTALLY FIT, 4.04% PARTIALLY FIT and 0.2% UNFIT; in the group between 50 and 70 years of age and those over 70, the numbers of TOTALLY FIT drop (86.15 and 49.04%) while those PARTIALLY FIT (12.19 and 41.35%) and UNFIT (1.66 and 9.61%) increase. Our results show these centres to be useful for selection and for the detection of disabilities and illnesses which may lead to the restriction or cancellation of a driving licence. On the other hand, they should be totally integrated in the Health Education and Health Protection systems.</dc:description>
