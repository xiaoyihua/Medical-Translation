<dc:description xml:lang="en">Whooping cough is an immune preventable disease that can be life threatening. Despite infant immunization starting at 2 month of age, there are many cases and outbreaks in our country and also around the world, with a high risk of mortality specially in infants under 6 month of age. It has been proposed that antenatal vaccination with acellular pertussis component (Tdap) would be useful, safe and effective since it transfers a high antibody rate to the child, reducing the incidence of pertussis in this group by 85%. No higher incidence of adverse effects has been found in pregnant women with this vaccine. This strategy has been implemented in several developed and Latin American countries. The purpose of this manuscript is to review and discuss the benefits of antenatal vaccination with Tdap. It was concluded that maternal immunization with Tdap vaccine should be promoted to prevent infection and associated mortality in the less than 6 months of age by Bordetella pertussis.</dc:description>
