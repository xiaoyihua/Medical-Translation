<dc:description xml:lang="en">Diabetes mellitus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and it has been studied in relation to the organs that affects, and the reproduction system is not the exception. Scientists had developed experimental animal models to investigate the effects of diabetes using different substances being streptozotocin (STZ) the most effective. STZ is natural compound produced by the Streptomyces achromogenes that selectively destroys the beta cells of the pancreas breaking the DNA. It has been proved that equilibrated solutions of STZ stored at 6 degrees C, are very effective in inducing diabetes to several animal species such as rat, mouse and hamster. In rats, the disorders in reproduction have been associated to dysfunctions in the hipotalamohipofisis-gonadal axis, given by a reduction in the secretion of GnRH, as well as of LH, FSH, prolactin and alterations in the gonadal secretion of steroids (testosterone, estrogens, progesterone). Due to this situation, male production of spermatozoids as well as its' motility is impair. In females, the principal effects are ovaric atrophy, impaired folliculogenesis, insufficiency of the corpora lutea, and problems associated with the maintenance of pregnancy. Many researchers had associated the prevalens of congenital malformation with a hiperglucemic state, being the most common retardation of the development, defects in the closure of the neural tube, micrognatias, heart malformations, etc.</dc:description>
