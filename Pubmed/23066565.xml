<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The maintenance of cold chain can result difficult in Emergency Mobil Units that's why the aim of this study is to value the effectiveness of portable fridges with/without compressor and its cost-effectiveness by a computer simulation. METHODOLOGY This descriptive, transversal and cost effectiveness analysis was developed in two Emergency Mobil Units of 061 Aragón of Alcañiz (Teruel) along a year. RESULTS The results showed that in the fridge with compressor, the 93'8% of the temperatures was between 2 and 8 degrees C, where as in the fridge without compressor was of the 35,7%.The global and specific cost effectiveness ratio of the fridge with and without compressor were of 0,063 and 7,411 and of 0,080 and 147,55 respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Fridge with compressor was more cost-effective, amortizing quickly its initial cost. This fridge had a better and more efficient thermoregulation what supposed a better conservation of drugs and lower costs, according to the model of simulation.</dc:description>
