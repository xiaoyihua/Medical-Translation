<dc:description xml:lang="en">We assessed the transmission potential and the mean infected and infective biting density of S. ochraceum in an onchocerciasis endemic community in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. In addition, the impact of first treatment of ivermectin during the peak of natural infection of host-seeking S. ochraceum populations was also evaluated. Monthly entomological sampling was carried out during the year before treatment to assess the seasonal biting behavior of parous host-seeking S. ochraceum females, and either infected (with whatever stage of O. volvulus) or infective females (with only third larval stage of O. volvulus). The mean of infective biting density was unimodal with the peak in February. Higher densities of infective females were detected from January to March. Annual infective biting density estimated was 95.2 and the annual transmission potential of 152.3. After treatment with ivermectin, entomological collections were carried out during the December-April period. In these months, the first ivermectin mass treatment produced a reduction of natural infection rates of 55 per cent in the mean infected females density (p &lt; 0.001) and of 30 per cent in the transmission potential. However, significative differences were found in parity rates of biting females during the evaluation periods. Decrease of infection rates in vector populations was caused by immediate effect of ivermectin over the skin microfilariae. Microfilariae community load available for transmission declined significantly from 14 Dmg/mg to 5.9 Dmf/mg. These means were statistically different (p &lt; 0.001) and were reduced by 58 per cent from the baseline value.</dc:description>
