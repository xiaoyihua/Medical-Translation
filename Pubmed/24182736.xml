<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The present study evaluates energy and nutrient intake in Spanish children under three years of age, and compares the results with the current recommendations in order to identify possible inadequate nutrient intake. PATIENTS AND METHODS A cross-sectional pilot study. The mothers completed a diet diary for four non-consecutive days, recording the products and amounts consumed by their children. Nutrient intake was calculated, and the results were compared with the dietary reference intakes (DRI) for each age group. RESULTS A total of 188 children (93 boys and 95 girls) aged 0-6 (n=41), 7-12 (n=24), 13-24 (n=57), and 25-36 months (n=66) were included. Statistically significant differences in DRI were observed for most of the nutrients analyzed. Protein intake, in particular was 376% of DRI in children between 1-3 years of age. By age groups, 96% of the children aged 7-12 months, 88% of the children aged 13-24 months, and 97% of the children aged 25-36 months showed protein intakes more than two-fold DRI. CONCLUSIONS Nutrient intake differed from the DRI, particularly as regards proteins. A new study is required to determine whether the observed study deviations could be representative of the national population of this age group, as well as the possible effects on child health.</dc:description>
