<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse therapy non-compliance in hypertension treatment in Spain, after a review of studies published between 1984 and 2005. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES Data searches used Internet (Medline and Spanish index on doctoral these), a manual search of several Spanish journals, and bibliographic references to compliance from detected articles and through personal contact with experts. Descriptors used were: hypertension and patient compliance, compliance, adherence, patient drop-outs, treatment refusal, and their combinations. SELECTION OF STUDIES Studies conducted in Spain and published between 1984 and 2005 were included, along with original articles, congress abstracts or doctoral theses, which used as a method of measurement pill count or counting of spaces in electronic monitoring systems, and which defined as non-compliers patients with a compliance percentage &lt;80% and &gt;110%. DATA EXTRACTION The percentage of non-compliers was calculated, with 95% confidence intervals and weighted average of the percentage of non-compliers in each study. RESULTS Twenty-six research studies published in Spain, excluding 2 analytical studies, were found. A total of 3553 patients with hypertension were included, of which 32.53% were non-compliers (n= 1156; 95 CI, 29.83-35.23) and 67.47% were compliers (n=2397; 95% CI, 65.67-69.27). The weighted average of non-compliance was at 32.78%. CONCLUSIONS The percentage of therapy non-compliance in the treatment of hypertension in Spain has fallen in recent years, although it continues to be high.</dc:description>
