<dc:description xml:lang="en">Inhalant systems are often the drug administration method of choice for numerous respiratory diseases. The use of these systems is increasing due to their many advantages, one of which is the small quantity of medication they can deliver to a specific area. However, they also have their disadvantages, as inhalers require certain techniques that are not always followed. Inhalants may be propelled by a variety of methods: pressurized canisters, pumps, dry powder dispensers, nebulizers. Because each of these systems have their own administrating technique, the patient needs to be instructed in the proper use of the inhaler, with periodic follow-ups by health care workers to insure this.</dc:description>
