<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as a staging procedure in multiple breast cancer is a controversial issue. We have aimed to evaluate the efficacy of sentinel node (SN) detection in patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer as well as the safety of its clinical application after a long follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective descriptive study was performed. Eighty-nine patients diagnosed of multiple breast cancer (73 multifocal; 16 multicentric) underwent SLNB. These patients were compared to those with unifocal neoplasia. Periareolar radiocolloid administration was performed in most of the patients. Evaluation was made at an average of 67.2 months of follow-up (32-126 months). RESULTS Scintigraphic and surgical SN localization in patients with multiple breast cancer were 95.5% and 92.1%, respectively. A higher percentage of extra-axillary nodes was observed than in the unifocal group (11.7% vs 5.4%) as well as a significantly higher number of SN per patient (1.70 vs 1.38). The rate of SN localization in multicentric cancer was slightly lower than in multifocal cancer (87.5% vs 93.1%), and the finding of extra-axillary drainages was higher (20% vs 10%). Number of SN per patient was significantly higher in multicentric breast cancer (2.33 vs 1.57). No axillary relapses have been demonstrated in the follow-up in multiple breast cancer patients group. CONCLUSIONS SLNB performed by periareolar injection is a reliable and accurate staging procedure of patients with multiple breast cancer, including those with multicentric processes.</dc:description>
