<dc:description xml:lang="en">We review the relations between the radiology department and the clinicians that attend emergency patients, complementing our opinions with a survey conducted in the emergency departments of hospitals in the autonomous region of Madrid. A dedicated emergency radiology section is present in 63.2% of hospitals. Radiologists are readily available to consult in the emergency department in 100%. Radiologists are involved in the initial workup in 61% of hospitals, in follow-up in 22.3%, and in both the initial workup and follow-up in 16.7%. At least one common protocol is shared by radiologists and emergency clinicians in 73.7% of hospitals. Radiologists participate in deciding which imaging tests to perform in 78.9% of hospitals. Radiologists provide a written report of the examination in 83.3% of cases. Continual assessment of the relations between the emergency department and the radiology department will enable us to understand their dynamics and to know what aspects can be improved.</dc:description>
