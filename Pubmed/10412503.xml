<dc:description xml:lang="en">A dietary survey was carried out at the National University of Luján (Argentina), with the objective of evaluating: a) food consumption and energy supply of cereals; b) the adequation of the intake of protein, calcium, iron, vitamins A, B1, B2, C and niacin, regarding the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA). A representative sample of 827 people (16% of the total population of 1991, equally distributed in the four seasons) was assessed with a 24 hour dietary recall. Sample was composed by: males: 189, aged 18-24 ys (GIM); 189, aged 25-50 ys (G2M); females: 209, aged 18-24 ys (GIF); 240, aged 25-50 ys (G2F). The results showed that cereals, 90% deriving from wheat products, supplied 32% of the total energy intake in G1F and between 40% and 48% in the other three groups. The mean daily intake of meat ranged between 90.5 g and 128.7 in females and over 140.0 g in males. Dairy products consumption was quite low, as well as fruits and vegetables in the whole of the population. Protein intake was over 1.25 g/d in 50% of the population. Calcium intake was below the RDA in a great percentage of the population, the mean percentage of adequation being: G1F, 71%; G2F, 62%; G1M, 64%; G2M, 65%. Iron mean daily intake was quite good, ranging between 16.4 and 20.8 mg in females and between 17.5 and 19.2 mg in males. The percentage of iron supplied by meat was: G1F, 16%; G2F, 21%; G1M, 34% and G2M, 26%; therefore iron bioavailability can be considered high. Besides, "mate", which is drunk between meals, supplied between 25% and 29% of the total iron intake in females and between 12% and 56% in males. Vitamin A intake was below the RDA in 74% to 58% of the population. The mean intake of vitamin B1 was 89% of the RDA in G1M and over RDA in the other three groups. Intake and percentage of adequation of vitamin B2, vitamin C and niacin presented a great range, but the mean values were over the RDA. The overall results showed: a) a high protein intake, providing red meat between 26% and 39%; b) low consumption of dairy products, with the consequence of a low calcium and vitamin A intake; c) low consumption of fruits and vegetables, being in relation to the low intake of fibre and carotenes; d) high consumption of cereals, mainly wheat products, that must be controlled from the toxicological point of view, due to the variable presence of mycotoxins. These results are in agreement with other dietary surveys carried out in previous years and are a consequence of some characteristic feeding habits of the Argentine population. They show that nutritional education is necessary for promoting changes in the latter, with the aim of reaching a better nutritional status.</dc:description>
