<dc:description xml:lang="en">Using monoclonal antibodies, it was determined the T3, T4 and T8 1ym phocyte populations in the blood samples of 40 patients with acute viral hepatitis (20 type A and 20 type B). al patients showed complete remission from it. The results of this study were compared with those of a control group of 20 healthy subjects. There was a non significant decreased of the total number of lymphocytes measured with the T3 monoclonal antibody in both types of hepatitis. The number of T8 lymphocytes was significantly increased (p less than 0.05) when the results were compared with those of the control group. The quotient T4/T8 was diminished in the initial phase of the disease (p less than 0.05). There were no other differences between hepatitis A and hepatitis B. In the follow up of the disease, the results tend to normal values in the whole group of patients.</dc:description>
