<dc:description xml:lang="en">Decubitus ulcers present a real challenge to health care workers. Primary care nurses, in particular, are faced with special considerations when treating a patient in his or her home. For them, it is often necessary to adapt or design treatments to meet the particular circumstances of the patient. Within their Home Health Program, the authors have developed a self care method that is based on educating patients and the family members who will assist them. In this way the families and patients become partners in the planning and application of the proper nursing care that will allow them a greater independence and quality of life.</dc:description>
