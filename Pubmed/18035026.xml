<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Since 1947, the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and food industries have used gallates as antioxidants to prevent the oxidation of unsaturated fats in their products. The aim of this study was to review the cases of sensitization to gallates diagnosed in our department between 1985 and 2006. METHODS All suspected cases of allergic contact dermatitis with patch tests positive for propyl gallate, octyl gallate, and/or dodecyl gallate were retrieved from the database of the allergy section of our dermatology department. RESULTS Forty-six patients had positive patch tests for 1 or more gallates (36 women and 10 men, with a mean age of 42.8 years). The most common presenting complaint was cheilitis (63% of the cases) followed by dermatitis of the hands (28.26%). The most common sensitizing agent was lipstick (54.3%) followed by bakery products (15.2%). The test result was considered clinically relevant in 73.9% of the cases whereas the relevance was unknown in 23.9 %. CONCLUSIONS In our case series, most patients sensitized to gallates attended the clinic due to cheilitis. The main allergen was propyl gallate and the most common mechanism of sensitization was use of lipstick. The most common gallate among bakers was octyl gallate. This agent was considered to be clinically relevant in all cases studied.</dc:description>
