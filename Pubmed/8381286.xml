<dc:description xml:lang="en">Previous results in from our laboratory have shown that early malnutrition causes an increase in brain serotonin (5-HT) synthesis. In the present work, male rats were submitted to proteinic-caloric malnutrition during gestation, lactation or both. A significant increase in 5-HT concentration was confirmed in the cerebral cortex and in the hypothalamus. In the macronutrients selection behavior test an important reduction in carbohydrates consumption was noted. Acute experiments in which an increase of the brain neurotransmitter was also induced, support the chronic ones, with a significant decrease in the carbohydrates intake. Altogether, these results suggest that the increase of the brain neurotransmitter during development has a functional role because there is a positive correlation with the modification of feeding behavior.</dc:description>
