<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND During last decade the metabolic syndrome has been defined by five different guidelines. Discrepancies in such definitions could influence syndrome predictive ability over cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the degree of agreement between these five guidelines, in population from Cartagena (Colombia). METHODS A cross sectional study was conducted in adults from urban zone. Sample size was estimated based on 2005 DANE census, which included 670 individuals. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was determined through the WHO (World Health Organization), AHA/NHLBI (American Heart Association/National Heart Lung and Blood Institute), ATP III (Adult Treatment Panel III), IDF (International Diabetes Federation) and JIS (Joint Interim Statement) guidelines. Frequencies obtained were compared through Cohen's kappa index. RESULTS According to JIS, IDF, ATPIII, AHA/NHBLI and WHO guidelines, metabolic syndrome prevalence was 36.3% [32.6 - 39.9], 35.1%, 30.3%, 24.2% and 4.9%. Agreement between JIS and IDF was 0.893, while index for these two guidelines with AHA/NHLBI was 0.778 y 0.750, respectively. ATPIII had a lower agreement with JIS and IDF (0.711 and 0.645, respectively), however with AHA/NHLBI agreement was 0.863. WHO presented a agreement with the others guidelines between 0.14 and 0.16. CONCLUSIONS Significant agreement was found between the four most recent guidelines. Abdominal obesity cut-off points might support differences agreement differences.</dc:description>
