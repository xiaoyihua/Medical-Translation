<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The integration of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer in clinical practice is one of the challenges faced by surgical societies. The aim of the present study was to analyze the results obtained during the implementation phase of this technique. PATIENTS AND METHOD From January 2003 to June 2005, 40 patients with rectal carcinoma underwent laparoscopic surgery in our center. Clinical and pathological variables were prospectively collected for statistical analyses. RESULTS A total of 27 men and 13 women underwent surgery: 11 high (HAR) and 20 low anterior resections (LAR) and 9 abdominoperineal resections (APR) were performed. Operative time was 240.4 +/- 200 min and was greater in the LAR group (259.7 vs 201.5 min; p=.02). The intraoperative complication rate was 22.5% (9% HAR vs 25% LAR; p=NS). The mean length of hospital stay was 8.7 +/- 4.8 days. The rate of postoperative complications was 32.5%. The conversion rate was 15% (6 patients), and was greater in the LAR group (25% vs 0% HAR vs 11.1% APR; p=0.02). The most common intraoperative complication and the most frequent cause of conversion consisted of stapling problems (4 patients). Surgery was considered curative in 34 patients (85%). One case of positive radial margins was encountered (3.3%). The mean distal and radial margins were 3.6 +/- 2.7 cm and 1.1 +/- 0.9 cm respectively. CONCLUSIONS The overall results during the implementation stage of laparoscopic surgery for rectal surgery were satisfactory. Conversion rates were highest in LAR, which proved to be the most demanding procedure.</dc:description>
