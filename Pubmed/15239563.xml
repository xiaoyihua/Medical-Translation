<dc:description xml:lang="en">The injury of the urinary tract in a pelvic surgery is inherent, its real frequency in which it presents, is difficult to establish, due that not all the lesions are published. In this article, two cases of ureteral obstruction posterior to a Burch-procedure, and the way they were resolved is reported. The ureteral obstruction is a very rare complication, but one that has the worst and severe medico-legal consequences, if they are not resolved opportunely. Its frequency in our service was of 0.41%, in 240 Burch-procedures that were realized during April of 1997 and June of 2000.</dc:description>
