<dc:description xml:lang="en">The proved relation that the gastrointestinal flora has in the origin of the pulmonary, urinary, injury infections, or in the critically ill patient's sepsis as it turns potentially pathologic, has caused us to carry out a study whose objective would be to determine the influence of the enteral feeding in the gastrointestinal flora, as for the variety of the species and their meaning. The prospective survey has been carried out from October, 1992 to May 1993, and it includes thirty patients, eighteen of whom received enteral nutrition while the others received nutritional supplementation through different ways. Only the patients with a minimum four day stay in the Intensive Care Unit of the Basurto hospital were included. The samples for microbiologic study were taken by means of rectal swab (80%) or faeces (20%). No qualitative neither quantitative differences have been obtained in the gastrointestinal flora between the patients who have received enteral nutrition and those who have not, except three cases attributable to the antibiotherapy. In conclusion, in our study, the enteral nutrition has not influenced the critic patient's gastrointestinal flora.</dc:description>
