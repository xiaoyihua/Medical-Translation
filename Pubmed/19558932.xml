<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To identify the needs of the family of admitted patients in the Critical Care Unit (CCU), and their level of satisfaction with the attention that they received. DESIGN Cross-sectional, observational study. SETTING Critical Care Unit, Virgen Macarena University Hospital, Seville. SUBJECTS OF THE STUDY: Two-hundred and sixty-eight families were selected through a random sampling system. INSTRUMENTS A survey was developed using bibliography as reference. RESULTS According to information, it was observed that receiving information after visiting hours and its access was difficult in regards to unforeseen changes in the patient's course. On the other hand, there were high levels of satisfactions with the attention received and with the nursing cares. Nevertheless, several deficiencies were observed in the identification of all the professionals, the visiting hours, the physical conditions of the waiting room, and privacy within patient's care environment. CONCLUSIONS One of the principal needs of the relatives was to spend more time with the patients. Regarding to the information, access after visiting hours, and on that regarding unforeseen changes in the patient's evolution should be reviewed. Regarding satisfaction, in general, families were highly satisfied with the attention received, especially with the nurse's care. Nevertheless, these professionals should encourage the participation of the families in the patient's care. Moreover, all the areas of improvement observed should be dealt with urgently, mainly the visiting hours.</dc:description>
