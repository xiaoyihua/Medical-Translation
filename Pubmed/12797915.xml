<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Analyze the results concerning the heart failure population of CARDIOTENS 99, a cross-sectional study of hypertension associated with cardiovascular disease carried out on 32,051 patients seen in Cardiology and Primary Care consultations. METHODS In the analysis we included prospectively demographic, clinical, blood pressure, and therapeutic data of all patients seen on a single day by 1,159 physicians (21% cardiologists; 79% Primary Care physicians). RESULTS 4% of the total sample of 32,051 patient had heart failure, representing 23% of the patients with heart disease. Median age was 70,8 6,7 years; 53% were women. Hypertension was the most frequent risk factor, appearing in 71% of the patients with heart failure. Hypertension was most frequent in Primary Care patients (76% versus 63%; p &lt; 0,01), while ischemic heart disease was most frequent in cardiology patients (38% versus 27%; p &lt; 0,01). Cardiology patients showed a trend for greater use of drugs in comparison with patients seen in primary care consultations but without significant differences (3,39 versus 3,35; p &gt; 0,05). Diuretics were the drugs with greater prescription (63%). 44% patients with heart failure were on an angiotensin-conversing enzyme inhibitor and 14% on beta-adrenergic blockers. Systolic blood pressure was well controlled in only 19% of hypertensive patients with heart failure, according to the international recommendations (&lt; 130 mmHg). The proportion of patients with blood pressure higher than 140 mmHg was superior among the patients seen by cardiologists than between those seen by Primary Care physicians (57% versus 47%; p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Heart failure is often associated with hypertension. Control of blood pressure is inadequate in the majority of patients with heart failure. Ischemic heart disease is a more frequent cause of in the patients seen by cardiologists than in those seen by Primary Care physicians, and hypertension is the leading cause of heart failure in these patients. Prescription of drugs recommended for the treatment of heart failure it is generally very scant.</dc:description>
