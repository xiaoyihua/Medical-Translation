<dc:description xml:lang="en">The term "conditionally essential" (or semi-essential), initially applied to amino acids, has been generalized to other nutrients. A conditionally essential nutrient is a compound usually produced in adequate amounts by endogenous synthesis but that is exogenously required under certain circumstances. Thus, arginine, glutamine, cysteine, glycine, carnitine, choline, and polyamines are conditionally essential compounds. In addition, dietary nucleotides are considered semi-essential since some rapidly growing tissues such as the gut, bone marrow, and lymphocytes, preferentially use preformed purine and pyrimidine bases for nucleic acid synthesis. This review discusses the study of conditionally essential nitrogenous nutrients of interest in clinical nutrition. Among them we highlight arginine, involved in endothelial, immune, gastrointestinal, and renal functions, in reproduction, neonatal development, wound healing, and tumorigenicity; glutamine, necessary for maintaining bowel integrity, and with beneficial effects on catabolic states such as sepsis, infection, trauma, and cancer; and nucleotides, implicated in cell growth and differentiation, and with various effects on lipid metabolism, intestinal microbiota, and immune system.</dc:description>
