<dc:description xml:lang="en">The advances in the field of molecular biology and genetics have widened the possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of hereditary diseases. At the same time research into this field has broken bounds of its legal and ethical regulation. The intention of this paper is not to analyze these advances from scientific and technical point of view which is the area of the specialist, but rather to review historical antecedents of genetic engineering; the legal and ethical repercussions of the human genome project (HGP); in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (FIVET); the embryo research which is being caused out and which may be possible; other fields of genetics and cloning especially germinal cells and human beings; genetic diagnosis and its family, social and work repercussions; treatment through genetic engineering, research into cloning in order to obtain organs and tissues for transplants; and the use of genetic engineering in the biomedical industry. To avoid these advances working against humans, the organization and participation of multidisciplinary bodies are required to provide legal and ethical supervision.</dc:description>
