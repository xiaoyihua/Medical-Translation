<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the last years we have experienced a remarkable growth of the Credited Educational Units in Pediatric Surgery. However any methodological system is not applied that evaluated qualitative and quantitatively the efficiency of these Units, neither the formative results of the residents. From the mark of the European Community a program is designed for the first time that includes, among other sections, the residents book ("log-book"). This initiative channeled through the National Commission of the specialty has allowed to know in a homogeneous and detailed way the activity of the residents in Pediatric Surgery. The objective of this work is to analyze the surgical activity developed by the Spanish residents of Pediatric Surgery through the book of residents. All the gathered data of the books of residents were reviewed differentiating the surgical activity in the following ones remote: total surgical activity, neonatal surgery, pediatric general surgery, urology, plastic surgery, tumors and thoracic surgery. This type of studies allows to guide to the National Commission and the Spanish Society of Pediatric Surgery about the quality of the formation of the residents, the national necessities, the appropriate number of the credited Units and on the selection-evaluation approaches.</dc:description>
