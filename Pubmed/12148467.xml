<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose was to determine the relation between functional ovary cysts (FOC) in patients with bilateral tubal occlusion (BTO) compared against a group of patients without the occlusion. Retrospective study, transversal and comparative in which 1,060 cases of patients that had pelvic ultrasounds were studied. 2 groups were formed: Group 1 with 356 patients with BTO, Group 2 without surgical sterilization history. In patients with BTO the FOC frequency was of 25.0% against a 15.7% detected in those without previous surgery. The frequency of FOC predominates in nulliparous patients without BTO (28.8%). On the age relation it is seen that en patients with BTO, the higher peak were functional cysts showed is on the 26 to 32 years old group. In patients without BTO the distribution is similar along the reproductive life with no domain of any age subgroup. The Xi'2 test showed that the difference of FOC in patients with BTO had a significant P &lt; 0.05. BTO as antecedent is a factor that favors FOC and a cause-effect correlation exists. In women without. BTO age doesn't influence the incidence of FOC, and regarding the parity, FOC were observed more often in nulliparous patients with less that 30 years old. FOC can be related to other symptoms like an ovulation menstrual disorders, and pelvic ache. After this finding we must think about long-term complications resulted from bilateral tubal occlusion brings. We should also re-assess the surgical technique used since it can modify the living quality of the operated patients. BTO as a chosen procedure through informed consent, 0 offers in most of the cases more benefits than risks, nonetheless, there is the chance of consequence and long term symptoms and this should be informed to the patient.</dc:description>
