PATIENTS Women and children using a programme for mothers and infants at greater social risk. Infant health (IH): immigrant children, low social and economic level and conflictual family relationships. Family planning (FP) and young adult (YA): previous abortion, low social and economic level, immigrants. Pregnancy monitoring (PM): pregnancies in women under 20, immigrants, unwanted pregnancy. Vaccinations: living in an area of social risk, child of immigrants. INTERVENTIONS 1) Preferential focus on risk groups, specific markers in records and archives. 2) Checking attendance at appointments and recouping. 3) Early referral to the social worker (and midwife in risk pregnancy). 4) Analysis of reasons for leaving programme and improving access.
