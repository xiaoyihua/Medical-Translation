<dc:description xml:lang="en">The pancreas divisum is the most frequent congenital anomaly of the pancreas. It is caused by the absence of fusion in the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds, so that most of the gland drains through the Santorini duct in the minor papilla. It has been suggested that the relative obstruction of the pancreatic pain and pancreatitis in these patients. According to this the treatment consists in facilitating the minor papilla drainage via surgery or endoscopy. Two endoscopic treatment cases are presented. In both pancreatic duct stent and further sphinterotomy were performed. This treatment and their follow-up are evaluated, coming to the conclusion that this method should be taken into account in the future, due to its viability and low morbimortality.</dc:description>
