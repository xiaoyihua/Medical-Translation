<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To know the availability of antidotes in hospital and extra-hospital emergency services in Catalonia (Spain), their real use, and the cost. PATIENTS AND METHODS Availability was studied by means of a transversal questionnaire carried out in 24 hospitals and 3 extra-hospital emergency services in Catalonia; the real use of antidotes was investigated using a prospective study carried out for one year in the same 24 hospitals, and the cost was determined using the data obtained over 12 months in one large hospital. RESULTS Average availability was 35 antidotes in hospital and 13 in extra-hospital emergency services. In no service did the availability coincide exactly with that of another service, nor with the recommendations made by international institutions (World Health Organization and International Programme for Chemical Safety) or the Government of Catalonia. The low incidence of availability of antidotes to cyanide was notable. Antidotes were used in 12.9% of acute intoxications. In 167 cases treated with these drugs, only 9 different antidotes were used. The consumption of these antidotes represents 0.1% of the budget of a pharmacy service in one large hospital. CONCLUSIONS The availability of antidotes in Catalonia is heterogeneous and some services lack antidotes whose use is considered essential. Antidotes are scarcely used in acute intoxications and their economic cost is low.</dc:description>
