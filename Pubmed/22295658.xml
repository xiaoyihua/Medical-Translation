<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION We present a retrospective study of our paediatric patients affected by pilonidal disease over the last 5 years. PATIENTS AND METHOD In all cases a broad excision of the pilonidal tissue was made, without colour signing the different incision sites and primary closure of the defect with no drainage. RESULTS Using this technique we treated 20 adolescents (15 girls and 5 boys) of ages between 12 and 15 years (average age 13.3 years) and body mass index between 17 and 33 (mean BMI 26.4 kg/m2). Mean hospitalisation time was 1.45 days. Preoperative antibiotherapy with Amoxicillin-clavulanic was administered to 55% of patients and continued over the first postoperative week. We had four cases with recurrence of the disease (25%) (two of these with two recurrences), which we treated with three primary closures on the midline and three by flattening the cleft. In 2 cases with dehiscence of the wound we allowed treatment by secondary intention. No flaps or marsupialisation were attempted in any case. In all cases the result was aesthetically satisfactory, with maintenance of the intergluteal fold. CONCLUSIONS In our series we have succeeded in undertaking primary closure of the defect after pilonidal resection without any excessive tension. This treatment enables a rapid return to a normal routine. We considered it important to undertake surgery that maintained the intergluteal fold, especially in patients with a short-term evolution of the disease, reserving flattening the cleft, closure by secondary intention, or primary closure by inserting flaps only for cases of recurrent disease; those with long-term evolution; or patients with complex lesions prior to surgery. Nutritional support to reduce overweight is very important in many patients.</dc:description>
