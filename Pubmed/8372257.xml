<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To evaluate the postoperative analgesic efficacy, side effects and acceptance by patients and nurses of intravenous "patient-controlled analgesia" (PCA) with morphine, metamizole and buprenorphine. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this randomized double blind prospective study of 150 patients in three groups receiving morphine (group A), metamizole (group B) or buprenorphine (group C), the patients had undergone low abdominal surgery with the same anesthetic protocol. Pain was recorded during the first 48 h after surgery on an orally-communicated scale of none or slight = 0, moderate = 1 and severe = 2. Upon the first report of moderate pain, patients were administered an intravenous bolus containing 5 mg morphine, 1 g metamizole or 0.15 mg buprenorphine. A perfusion pump was then connected and set with one bolus of 1.2 mg morphine, one of 333 mg metamizole or one of 0.04 buprenorphine. The maximum dose allowed in 24 h was 40 mg morphine, 8 g metamizole or 1.2 mg buprenorphine. The minimum interval between doses was 30 min for all three groups. Side effects reported were respiratory depression, sedation, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, perspiration and pain upon administration. Patients and nurses were asked to evaluate the system when the pump was disconnected and the results were then analyzed statistically. RESULTS The analgesic effect was satisfactory in all three groups, with no significant differences among them. The percentages of patients reaching the maximum allowed dose on the first day were 2% with morphine, 18% (p &lt; 0.05) with metamizole and 8% with buprenorphine. No respiratory depression was observed. Sedation was greater with morphine and buprenorphine than with metamizole (p = 0.0001). Pruritus was also greater with morphine and buprenorphine than with metamizole (p = 0.02) and pain upon infusion was greater with metamizole (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS Intravenous postoperative PCA was effective with all three drugs studied. Patient and nurse acceptance was good and side effects were few in the three groups. The lower rate of side effects for metamizole makes it the drug of choice.</dc:description>
