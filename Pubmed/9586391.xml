<dc:description xml:lang="en">The pregnancy increases the risk of cardiovascular ischemic events, The longitudinal sinus thrombosis is very rare, but the incidence increases during pregnancy and puerperium. The mortality rates range from 25% to 50%. This report consists of a case which was studied and managed at the Military Central Hospital. It occurred on the 12th day post C-S. The diagnostic was confirmed by MRI. The treatment consisted of rest and heparin with a successful development. Our findings agreed with the studies reported at the literature that suggested a beneficial effect with the heparin's use, lowering drastically the mortality rates. Some still oppose to its use because of the risk of an intracranial hemorrhage.</dc:description>
