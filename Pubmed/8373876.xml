<dc:description xml:lang="en">We examined the effect on platelet aggregation and activation and the production of eicosanoids in nonseptic critical patients of two lipidic emulsions administered with total parenteral nutrition. The two lipidic emulsions, Intralipid (20% of long chain triglycerides) and Lipofundina (10% each of long and medium-chain triglycerides), of differing essential fat acid content, provided 43% of the non-protein calorific requirements calculated for each patient. There were no other variables in the parenteral nutrition administered: the patients were distributed in two groups on a randomized basis according to the type of lipids received. We assessed the parameters demonstrating platelet function before parenteral nutrition, and after 4 and 7 days of such nutrition. Throughout the study, platelet aggregability was seen not to differ significantly from normal, even though the activation parameters controlled, beta TG and PF4, were from the outset significantly higher than normal; the thromboxane B2 averages calculated remained high, with wide individual variability, while averages for 6-keto-PGF1 alpha [correction of 0], which were initially high, showed a tendency (not statistically significant) to drop after 4 and 7 days nutrition. We did not observe that the administration of LCT or MTC/LCT led to changes in platelet aggregation and/or activation in the patients studied.</dc:description>
