<dc:description xml:lang="en">Clinic, epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of 128 episodes of cryptococcosis were retrospectively evaluated in 106 positive HIV patients hospitalized at the Paroissien Hospital on period 1996-2007. There were 75 male and 31 female patients, with a median age of 34 years, ranging from 20 to 68 years. Addiction to intravenous drugs was the main cause of HIV infection in 55 patients (51.9%). Cryptococcosis was detected as single episode in 85 patients (80.2%) and as relapse in 19 (17.9%). It appeared as the first marking disease in 36 patients (34.0%). Diagnosis was established in 116 episodes by CSF study (Indian ink, culture, antigen detection), in 9 cases by Cryptococcus sp. recovery from blood cultures, and in 3 cases by antigen detection in patient's serum with a latex reactive. Neurological symptomatology, with headache and fever as the most common signs, was presented by 89.6% of patients. Induction treatment was done in all cases with amphotericin B, and maintenance treatment was carried out with fluconazole. Mortality rate was 35.8%, being higher in those patients who had suffered relapses (41.3%) compared to those who presented a first episode of the mycosis (33.3%).</dc:description>
