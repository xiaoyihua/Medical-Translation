<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Although atrial pacing is a more physiological mode of stimulation in sinus node dysfunction, the pacing modes most often are used DDD and VVI. The aim of our study was to demonstrate that AAI/AAIR pacing is effective and safe by analyzing the complications and mortality of this pacing mode in a long-term follow-up study. PATIENTS AND METHOD Between 1982 and 2000 definitive AAI-mode pacemakers were implanted for sinus node dysfunction in mode AAI in 160 patients. We analyzed the clinical characteristics, evolution, and complications of the AAI pacing mode during a follow-up of 5.4 4.5 years. RESULTS The sample was made up of 104 women and 56 men with an average age of 72 12 years. During follow-up, it was necessary to change the pacing mode for symptomatic bradycardia in 11 patients (annual incidence 1.2%), which was caused by second or third-degree atrioventricular block in 7 patients (annual incidence 0.8%), and chronic atrial fibrillation with bradycardia in 4 patients (annual incidence 0.4%). During follow-up, atrial arrhythmias occurred in 32 patients (annual incidence 3.7%), stroke in 4 patients (annual incidence 0.4%), and 27 patients (annual incidence 3.1%) died. CONCLUSIONS The AAI/AAIR pacing mode was safe and effective in sinus node dysfunction, with a low percentage of pacing changes required for progression to atrioventricular block, low incidence of atrial arrhythmias, stroke and low mortality during long term follow-up.</dc:description>
