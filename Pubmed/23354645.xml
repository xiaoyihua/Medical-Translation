<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an effective therapy for hematological diseases such as lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In 2004, the Cancer Unit of the Ministry of Health incorporated the HSCT to the National Cancer Program in Adults. Until 2008 we purchased services to private institutions while implementing the national center for HSCT of adults in the Hospital del Salvador. AIM To report the first ten HSCT conducted in this center. MATERIAL AND METHODS All cases were approved by a national commission for adult HSCT. The entire process was carried out based on evidence-based protocols. RESULTS Six patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, three with multiple myeloma and one with a diffuse large B cell lymphoma were transplanted. Age range was 19 to 48 years and five patients were male. An average of 2.2 aphereses per patient was required. The CD 34 stem cell collection was 5.06 x 10(6) x Kg. The conditioning regimes were BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, melphalan) and melphalan 200 according to the underlying disease. Seventy percent of the patients developed mild to moderate mucositis and 50% had febrile neutropenia, with good response to treatment. In two cases there was an association with influenza. The engraftment of neutrophils and platelets was achieved on day +10 and +11 respectively. At follow-up until day +100, there was no morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSIONS These results confirm the quality standard that this intervention has achieved in our institution. The Chilean National Center for HSCT on Adults should be established as a public core care, teaching and research facility.</dc:description>
