<dc:description xml:lang="en">This article, of a conceptual nature, uses critical theory to discuss the programmatic logic within the sociosanitary field as a technical answer without any questions, provided to territories or spaces with questions awaiting translation. The purpose is to put programmatic logic, which is the legacy of public health planning and an expression of instrumental reason, into discussion, and in this way examine the temporal-spatial conception as an axis for thinking and acting within the complexity of the social world, recognizing other knowledge and practices. The questions, answers, knowledge and actions in the sociosanitary field constitute the focus of a reflection rooted in concepts that seek to deconstruct the ideological project represented by health programs through an analysis of their scientific basis (the epistemological component of the technical), which is antagonistic to any emancipatory project.</dc:description>
