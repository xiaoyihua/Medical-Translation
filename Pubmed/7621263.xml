<dc:description xml:lang="en">A group of patients with clinical manifestations suggesting biliary origin in whom diagnostic imaging techniques were negative were studied by duodenal biliary drainage with the aim of identifying whether microcalculi were present in the bilis being responsible for the symptomatology. The problem group was made up of 96 patients with the results being compared with those of a control group (without biliary disease) including 45 subjects. Duodenal biliary drainage was analyzed for the detection of microlithiasis in the biliary sediment in all the subjects. The analysis was positive in 46 (47.9%) of the patients with biliary clinical manifestations while analysis was positive in only 5 (11.2%) of the control group with the differences being statistically significant. Seventeen of the 46 positive patients underwent surgery demonstrating biliary disease in all (chronic cholecystitis). All these patients remained asymptomatic except one on follow up with 94.1% cure by cholecystectomy being achieved. The authors conclude that duodenal biliary drainage is a highly profitable, complication-free and easily performed diagnostic technique for the detection of microlithiasis which should be regularly used in patients with symptoms suggestive of biliary origin and complementary negative explorations.</dc:description>
