<dc:description xml:lang="en">Production of the components of the cellulase complex by Trametes trogii was investigated under different culture conditions. Endoglucanase, exoglucanase and beta-glucosidase were produced by Trametes trogii under shaken and stationary conditions using crystalline cellulose as the only carbon source. No marked differences were found for endo- and exoglucanase production between both culture conditions. In shaken cultures beta-glucosidase values doubled those obtained in stationary conditions. All maxima were reached approximately 10 days earlier in static cultures than in shaken ones. The addition of glucose to the culture medium improved growth but decreased abruptly the enzyme production. The optimal pH of the medium for the synthesis of the enzymes was 5.6, and the best incubation temperature was 25-28 degrees C. Enzyme activities were maximal at pH 3.1 and 45 degrees C (endoglucanase), pH 4.1 and 50 degrees C (exoglucanase) and pH 5.3 and 60 degrees C (beta-glucosidase).</dc:description>
