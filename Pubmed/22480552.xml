<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The use of supraglottic devices as a means of rescue in patients difficult to intubate or ventilate has increased in the field of anaesthetics and in emergency medicine. This study is designed to evaluate the success rate of blind intubations using two supraglottic devices, the Fastrach ILMA and the i-gel mask. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 80 patients (40 per group) were included. After positioning them a leak test was performed, the glottis view was checked with a fibrobronchoscope, and an attempt was made to introduce an endotracheal tube through the device, and the procedure was repeated. Adequate ventilation was evaluated, as well as the grade of fibrobronchoscope view, the success of the intubation, and the complications observed after their use. RESULTS There were no differences in the incidence of adequate ventilation with either device. The glottis view (Brimacombe scale) was better with i-gel (77.78% versus 68.42%) at the second attempt, but not on the first. A higher percentage of intubations were achieved with the Fastrach ILMA (70% versus 40%; P=.013). The incidence of throat pain was similar with both devices, but post-operative dysphonia was more frequent with i-gel (20% versus 0; P=.0053). CONCLUSIONS Both devices were equally effective in achieving adequate ventilation; however, the Fastrach ILMA enabled a higher number of intubations to be made than i-gel and with a lower incidence of post-operative dysphonia.</dc:description>
