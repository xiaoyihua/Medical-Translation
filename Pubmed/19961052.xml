<dc:description xml:lang="en">Prostate Cancer (CAP), is a complex disease with a multifactorial origin. It is characterized by heterogenous patterns of growth of neoplasic tissue, varying widely in its progression, age of beginning and therapy response. It is considered as the second most common cause of death by cancer in men and, it has been estimated, that one of five, suffers of CAP through the course of his life. The genetic etiology of neoplasic transformation of normal prostate cells is still not known; nevertheless, investigations in epidemiology have demonstrated a strong genetic component in its development, suggesting so much a pattern of mendelian inheritance as the presence of loci of susceptibility throughout the human genome. It has been described a cromosomic location related to the CAP in locus 1q24-25, denominated HPC1, where the gene RNASEL is located, and the seggregation of its alleles has been associated with the development of CAP in numerous familiar groups. The RNASEL gene codifies for a ribonuclease protein that degrades vi-ral and cellular ARN and takes part in the apoptosis. A decrease of the enzymatic activity up to three times in carriers of the G1385A polymorphism of this gene has been reported, and the same has been associated frequently with the development of CAP. Using a variant of the Polymerase Chain Reaction, Allele specific amplification, this investigation had as objective to determine the association between variant G1385A and CAP, in a sample of 103 masculine individuals with and without CAP, pertaining to the population of Maracaibo, Venezuela. An association between these variants and CAP could not be demonstrated.</dc:description>
