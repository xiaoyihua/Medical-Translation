<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The discovery and characterization of factors that induce and maintain specific neurotransmitter phenotypes has profound clinical implications, and continues to be one of the major objectives in the neurosciences. DEVELOPMENT Although much progress has been realized in this area, we still understand little of how cholinergic neurons acquire and maintain their neurotransmitter characteristics, nor do we fully comprehend why these neurons in some circumstances degenerate and loose their neurotransmitter specificity. There is evidence that some members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family have profound organizing and differentiating actions in the developing nervous system, and recent studies indicate an important role in determining the cholinergic neuronal phenotype. CONCLUSIONS BMP may act to differentiate neuronal precursor cells into cholinergic neurons and upregulate the cholinergic phenotype of already differentiated neurons in the central nervous system. This could suggest their potential use in the treatment of certain types of brain disorders.</dc:description>
