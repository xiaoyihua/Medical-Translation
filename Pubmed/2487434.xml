<dc:description xml:lang="en">The first case was a 2 year-old girl with Blackfan-Diamond anemia who developed the immune reaction two weeks after receiving two transfusions of sedimented erythrocytes. HLA typing of lymphocytes showed the presence of three HLA-A, two of which were present in the donors. The second was a newborn who initially received an exchange transfusion and three weeks later another transfusion of whole blood. Both cases exhibited a severe bone marrow involvement and a skin biopsy with the pattern of keratinocyte apoptosis and lymphocyte satellitosis. These histological findings although highly suggestive must be evaluated in the appropriate clinical setting.</dc:description>
