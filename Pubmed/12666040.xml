<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The search for variables that mediate in the shift from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia is currently a very active field of research. In this area, the term cognitive plasticity or modifiability can be of great interest. Proof of the existence of plasticity in the elderly with MCI and its possible value as an indicator of the shift from this condition to dementia have aroused an interest in investigating evaluation tools that enable the evaluation of plasticity in old age. AIMS. In this study we assess the validity of the position test (PT) as a measure of cognitive plasticity in the elderly and we examine its existence in people with MCI. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 117 elderly subjects were evaluated with the Spanish version of the MMSE (Minimental State Examination) as a screening test for cognitive impairment, the AVLT LP (Auditory Verbal Learning Test Learning Potential), a test that is frequently used to evaluate plasticity, and the PT. RESULTS Findings show that the PT evaluates cognitive plasticity in the elderly suffering from MCI, that it is possible to shorten the test without losing its evaluative properties and that performance in the test is not affected by educational level. Furthermore, it also reveals the fact that some elderly people with MCI show plasticity. CONCLUSION The data obtained allow us to state that the PT is ideal for evaluating plasticity in the elderly, and we also recommend further research into plasticity and its possible relation with the cognitive progress of people with MCI.</dc:description>
