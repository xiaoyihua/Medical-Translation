<dc:description xml:lang="en">Twenty three children aged 0.4 to 15 years, (x 7.5 years) with end-stage renal disease were treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) over 46 months. The mean time of treatment for the group was 13 months (range 1.0 to 31 months). Sixty five percent of the patients had readmission after catheter placement; 53% were for peritonitis. Nine out of 23 patients (39%), presented 20 episodes of peritonitis, an incidence of one episode per 15 patient months. Gram positive organisms were culture in 60% of these episodes. A total of 26 peritoneal catheters were placed in 23 patients. Of the five catheters that required replacement, three were for peritonitis. Seven out of 23 patients had nephrotic syndrome when admitted to CAPD, four of which develop peritonitis. Although no difference was seen between nephrotic and non nephrotic patients in relation to CAPD initiation and peritonitis development, nephrotic patients without peritonitis and non nephrotic had significantly higher initial growth index for height and iron binding capacity than those with nephrotic syndrome and peritonitis (-1.71 +/- 0.90 vs -2.29 +/- 0.27, P less than 0.05, and 265 +/- 50.5 vs 175 +/- 5.0 mg/dL, P less than 0.0005, respectively). No difference in mean plasma gamma globulin concentration was seen between patients with and without peritonitis. In 14 patients followed for a period greater than to 6 months, the delta growth index for weight and height and was: -0.13 +/- 0.31 and -0.31 +/- 0.46, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
