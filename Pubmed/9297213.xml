<dc:description xml:lang="en">Necrotizing soft tissue infection or necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive inflammation that leads to necrosis of subcutaneous tissues and fascia with secondary necrosis of skin. It is usually attributed to group AB hemolytic streptococci but may be caused by anaerobic bacteria. It occurs with higher frequency in elders, diabetics, alcoholics and patients with impaired immunity. Report mortality rates range from 14 to 80%. An early and timely surgical debridement with remotion of all necrotic tissue is mandatory. Wounds must be closed with splint skin grafts as soon as the local viability of tissues has been assured and the general conditions of the patients allow the procedure. Antibiotics nutritional and hemodynamic support are also necessary.</dc:description>
