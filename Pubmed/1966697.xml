<dc:description xml:lang="en">Oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) is a new lesion that appears specifically on the lateral borders of the tongue. It has basically been detected in immunosuppressed male homosexuals and it is associated with the later development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or HIV infection. Epstein-Barr virus has been suggested to be the possible etiological agent. A review of the existing literature pointing out definition, clinical, histopathologic and ultrastructural features, prognostic and treatment is made. Moreover the characteristics of the individuals suffering from it are equally studied. The role of the dentist at detecting the lesion, as well as the importance of its definitive diagnostic are emphasized, in virtue of the effects that may have a bearing on patients.</dc:description>
