<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the proportion of inappropriate days of hospitalization in the general surgery wards of three university hospitals, its causes, and associated factors. MATERIAL AND METHOD We concurrently reviewed 596 days of hospitalisation during a 1-week period in 2000, using the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP). The association among inappropriate days of hospital stay and independent variables was evaluated using bivariable and multivariable methods. Finally, the causes for inappropriate hospitalization use were analyzed. RESULTS The percentage of inappropriate days was 17.6%, with no significant differences among the hospitals (21.5%, 12.5% and 17.5%). Inappropriate days were associated with the weekend (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, scheduled admissions (OR = 2.9), hospital stay of more than 1 week (OR:2.3), the last third of the hospital stay (OR: 3.7), and inappropriate admission (OR: 2.1). The main causes of inappropriate hospital stays were organizational problems in the hospital or in the clinical management of discharge. CONCLUSIONS Inappropriate days of hospitalization represent a considerable percentage of hospitalization in surgery wards. The main reasons for inappropriate days are problems with surgical and discharge planning and factors that depend on the organization of the surgery departments and other related departments in the hospital.</dc:description>
