<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To analyze P53 mutations in a series of NHL and to determine its implication in the inactivation of the tumor suppressor function. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed 18 lymphomas by SSCP (exons 5 to 9) and subsequent sequencing technics to detect and characterize mutations on this gene. Loss of heterozigosity (LOH) was also studied with a VNTR near the p53 gene and with a intragenic microsatellite, comparing tumor and normal tissue. RESULTS We found altered bands by SSCP in 5 cases, 4 of them have been described by sequencing analysis. One case was a polymorphism and the others were missense mutations. All mutations appeared in high grade lymphomas. Only one case showed LOH in both VNTR and microsatellite. CONCLUSIONS This results suggest that p53 mutations may be associated with more malignant lymphomas.</dc:description>
