<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To review our experience in the diagnosis and management of ureteral injuries secondary to obstetric and gynecologic procedures. METHODS During the last 25 years, 42 patients were treated at our center for iatrogenic ureteral injuries (45 renal units) associated with obstetric and gynecologic procedures, principally hysterectomy via the abdominal approach (29 cases). The injury was diagnosed in the immediate postoperative period in 21 of the 42 cases. Surgical management was frequently by ureteroneocystostomy. Patient follow-up ranged from 3 months to 11 years. RESULTS Good results were obtained in 83.3% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS Ureteral injuries detected intraoperatively should be immediately repaired. For those diagnosed postoperatively, management by retrograde or antegrade catheterization and/or US or CT-guided percutaneous nephrostomy should be attempted before performing surgery.</dc:description>
