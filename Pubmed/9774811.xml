<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Epilepsy is a chronic disorder. The prognosis of one particular subtype, that of children with generalized spike and wave discharges (P-O) on the electroencephalogram (EEG), is unknown. OBJECTIVE To determine the prognosis of children with epilepsy with P-O on EEG and the factors which affect this. PATIENTS AND METHODS All EEGs done over ten years (39,322) were reviewed, and the epileptic patients under 14 years old identified. Absence and recurrence of crises were evaluated and the factors influencing them analyzed. Minimum significance was p &lt; 0.05. The chi square test, Student's t test and Kaplan-Meier method were used. Logistic regression models were devised. RESULTS Of the children studied, 78% became crisis-free. After monovariant and multivariant analysis the only conditions which fitted the regression models were: abnormal pregnancy; West syndrome or learning difficulties; having certain types of crises, myoclonic, clonic-tonic, partial simple or complex crises; a normal EEG with hypsarrhythmia, slow or fast P-O and requiring multiple medication. When medication ceased, 31.4% had recurrence of the episodes. On monovariant and multivariant analysis, protective factors were absence of attacks and risk factors were a family history of epilepsy or an EEG with rapid P-O. CONCLUSIONS The overall prognosis for epileptic children with P-O is good. There are factors which improve or worsen the pronosis, but these cannot be modified.</dc:description>
