<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED A clinical study of 111 newborns (NB) with prenatal diagnosis (PD) of urinary tract pathology was performed. The weight and size at birth, physical examination, incidence of uropathies, associated malformations and postnatal diagnostic studies were analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS All data corresponding to 111 neonates with PD of urinary tract pathology were submitted to the Student's t and Chi square tests and contingency tables. RESULTS Uropathies were more frequent in male NB (69%) and on the left side (2/1). Pyelocaliceal dilatation (PCD) was present in 46% of the patients. The mean weight and size was normal. However, NB with PCD had a mean weight of 249 grams below that observed in the remaining group (p = 0.016). Thirteen newborns (12%) had associated anomalies. An abdominal mass was present in 17 neonates with obstructive uropathies (15%). Serum urea and creatinine were normal in 101 neonates (91%). SUMMARY 1) PCD is the most frequent uropathy diagnosed prenatally. 2) The incidence of fetal uropathies, diagnosed prenatally, is higher in males. 3) The left side is more frequently involved. 4) The mean weight and size of NB with uropathies is normal. 5) The mean weight of NB with DCP is 249 grams lower than the rest of the group. 6) Serum urea and creatinine were found elevated only in severe bilateral obstructive uropathies.</dc:description>
