<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is caused by mutations in the genes that encode five of the subunits of the human NADPH oxidase. The most common form is caused by mutations in CYBB, the human gene encoding gp 91 phox. OBJECTIVE To identify the molecular defects causing CGD. CASE REPORT A male patient with a history of acute diarrhea and recurrent perianal abscess since two months old. At 6 months, the patient presented a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon and bacterial colitis. After three years, he developed infections in the lower and perianal respiratory tract. The cDNA analysis identified abnormal mRNA expression, which was confirmed by sequencing. Specifically the exclusion of exon 2 was observed. Additionally, gDNA sequencing identified an alteration in the acceptor splice site of intron 1, including a deletion followed by insertion of three nucleotides (c.46-14_-11delTTCT insGAA). CONCLUSIONS The first molecular study of a patient with CGD due to splicing pattern change, reported in Colombia, is presented. The definition of the mutation and its correlation with the phenotype is essential to provide appropriate genetic counseling to patients and their families.</dc:description>
