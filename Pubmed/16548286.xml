<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Preemptive analgesia, is obtained via aspartate antagonists and glutamate, neurotransmitters released during tissular injury. Objective Asses preemptive analgesia with dexmedetomidine and consumption of a postanesthesia analgesic. MATERIAL AND METHODS Male patients, 20-65 years ago were recruited after protocol review and informed consent was obtained. Patients were randomized in three groups, using dexmedetomidine as preemptive analgesia in inguinal hernioplasty. RESULTS Subjects had a mean age of 45.3 +/- 13.2 yrs. Among patients where dexmedetomidine was administered prior to anesthesia, three had, low heart frequency (60 bpm) and required that analgesia be given for 3.14 hrs. Among patients in whom dexmedetomidine was administered during transanesthesia, two registered low heart frequency (60 bpm.) and required analgesia for 2.27 hrs. In the control group, one patient had a heart frequency of 43 bpm; mean analgesic administration time was 39 minutes. There were no significant variations in arterial pressure. Statistical analysis included Anova, and Student's T-test to assess analgesia and initial time of analgesia consumption at p &lt; 0.001. CONCLUSION Intravenous dexmedetomidine administered prior to anesthesia decreases pain intensity and consumption of postoperative analgesia.</dc:description>
