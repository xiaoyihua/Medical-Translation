<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is the leading cause of infection in a hospital setting and is associated with a high mortality rate. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the pneumonia severity index (PSI) and confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age≥65 (CURB-65) systems in predicting 30-day mortality in HCAP in adult patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study took place and data from 109 non-immunocompromised individuals aged&gt;18 years were analyzed. The clinical diagnosis of HCAP included the presence of radiographic infiltrates in patients≥48hours after hospital admission. The PSI and CURB-65 scores were calculated and performance measures were estimated. Summary statistics were used to describe the study sample. The PSI and CURB-65 scores were calculated based on 20 and 5 criteria, respectively, and the performance indicators of the screening tools were estimated. RESULTS The overall 30-day mortality was 59.6%. At every given threshold, PSI sensitivity was higher, but showed a lower specificity than the CURB-65, and the highest Youden index (0.392) was observed at cut-off V in the PSI. The area under the ROC curve was 0.737 (95% CI: 0.646-0.827) and 0.698 (95% CI: 0.600-0.797) using the PSI and CURB-65 systems, respectively (P=.323). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that the performance of the PSI and CURB-65 is reasonable for predicting 30-day mortality in adult HCAP patients and may be used in healthcare settings.</dc:description>
