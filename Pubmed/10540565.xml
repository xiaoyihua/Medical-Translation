<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the obstruction of the air flow by flujimetry subsequent to the application of tests cutaneous specific (Dermatophagoides pteronisinnus) in sensitive children. MATERIAL AND METHODS They were studied 44 patient of one and other sex with diagnostic of asthma and antecedent of sensibility to the mite Dermatophagoides pteronisinnus through tests cutaneous for prick, with an average age of 6 to 16 years, captured of the external consult of the allergy service of the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gómez. It is a longitudinal study, prospective, blind, cross, in the one which previously was made a challenge test with antigen standardized of Dermatophagoides pteronisinnus or glycerine, previous reading of flujimetry. RESULTS Of the patients challenged with antigen in 23 there was decrease of the respiratory maximum flow, with a p &lt; 0.05, but without clinical meaning. When they were challenged with placebo only it reduced in patient seven the respiratory maximum flow, also significative statistically, but without clinic relevancy. CONCLUSION The cutaneous tests are a useful tool in allergy and sure, since almost they do not produce serious systemic reactions.</dc:description>
