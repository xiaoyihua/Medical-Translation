<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the level of knowledge of and capability for application of isolation precautions. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary-level pediatric hospital, and a questionnaire including structured questions and clinical scenarios was applied to healthcare personnel. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed with the chi-squared test and odds ratios were obtained. RESULTS A total of 131 healthcare workers participated in the study, including 34 (26%) attending physicians, 47 (36%) medical residents, 48 (37%) nurses, and 2 (1%) physicians who were heads of the department. According to our definition, 99 (75%) had poor, 22 (17%) had fair, and 10 (8%), good knowledge. With regard to the capability for application of isolation precautions, 66 (51%), 33 (25%), and 32 (24%) possessed poor, fair, and good levels, respectively. Association with poor knowledge was exhibited as follows: physicians, OR: 0.17 (0.005-0.54), p = 0.001; undergraduate degree in medicine, OR: 0.37 (0.16-0.83), p = 0.01; seniority &lt; 5 years, OR: 0.35 (0.14-0.86), p = 0.019, and training during previous year, OR: 0.09 (0.03-0.24), p = 0.005, while association with poor capability was the following; physician, OR: 0.25 (0.12-0.55), p = 0.005; undergraduate degree in medicine, OR: 0.38 (0.18-0.80), p = 0.009; seniority &lt; 5 years, OR: 0.90 (0.45-1.81), p = 0.78, and training during previous year, OR: 0.23 (0.10-0.51), p = 0.005. CONCLUSIONS Being a physician, having an undergraduate degree in medicine, &lt; 5 years working at the hospital, and having received training in the previous year were positively associated with knowledge and application of isolation precautions.</dc:description>
