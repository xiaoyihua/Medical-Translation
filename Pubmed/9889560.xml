<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The present case-control study was undertaken to elucidate the role of recent diet, specially in the influence of food groups, in the development of cancer of the breast. MATERIAL AND METHODS A case-control study of breast cancer (BC) was conducted between April to November 1997 in Valencia (Spain). Cases were 65 women aged 35-78 years. Controls included 78 women aged 34-82. Dietary habits were investigated through a validated food frequency consumption questionnaire (FFQ) included 100 foods. One summary questions were included, concerning all food items of a certain type or food frequently consumption. The difference between variables was tested by the chi-square method. For each food item, quintiles of consumption were calculated by dividing the frequency distribution of the entire study group into 20th, 40th, 60th and 80th percentiles and multiple linear regression analysis were fitted to the data. To assess the independent associations between selected BC risk factors and BC stage. RESULTS A significant trend of increasing risk with increasing intake emerged for the following food groups: Cereal dish (rice) (OR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.1-10.0), poultry (OR = 6.0; 95% CI: 0.9-43.9), beef meat (OR = 1.3: 95% CI: 0.5-3.6) and high intake of some food groups exerted a significant protection against development of BC: eggs (OR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.2-1.9), olive oil (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.1-2.0), tomatoes (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.1-1.8). When linear regression analyses was performed, consumption of tomatoes and parity showed an inverse association statistically significant with the stage of BC. CONCLUSIONS Consumption of tomatoes, mainly, consumption of eggs and olive oil, and parity exhibited a statistically significant relationship (p &lt; 0.05) with BC stage in Valencia (Spain).</dc:description>
