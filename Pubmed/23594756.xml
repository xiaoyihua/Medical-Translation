<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse the changes in synovial fluid (SF) in the most common knees joint diseases, and to establish a relationship according to its concentration. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 62 synovial fluids were analysed from knees with, meniscus disease (32), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) (17) and isolated chondral injury (13). A quantitative and quality study was performed on each sample, which included cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and growth factors, IGF-1 and TGF-ß). RESULTS The SF environment in the ACL injury was mainly anabolic and inflammatory, with increased levels of IL1, IL6, significant levels of TGF-ß (P=.02 and P=.004), IL-10 (P=.046 and P=.047) and significantly decreased levels of TNF-α (P=.02 and P=.004). There was mainly a catabolic environment in chondral and meniscal disease, with a significant increase in TNF-α and a significant decrease in TGF-ß (P=.02 and P=.004). The differences were greater in the case of isolated chondral injury. CONCLUSION The changes observed show that, as well as the biomechanical changes, the SF has a negative effect on joint homeostasis, it composition varying depending on the type of pathology.</dc:description>
