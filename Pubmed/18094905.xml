<dc:description xml:lang="en">Chronic low back pain and ciatica after surgery is one of the main reasons for referring patients to multidisciplinary pain units (MPU). The future expansions of MPU have promted neurosurgeons in Spain to re-enter the field of chronic pain management and to recover their enthusiam, that have been lost severel years ago for various reasons. We do not intend dealing with the new instrumented surgical options for the post-laminectoy pain, but rather into the indications and descriptions of the interventional techniques for lumbar and sciatic pain managemet. Currently there are a great number of percutaneous techniques to achieve pain control in the post-laminectomy syndrome. Traditional neuroablative techniques at the spinal cord or the cerebral levels are not any longer indicated. Nonetheless, lumbar sympathectomy and thermo-neurolisis either with chilling or heating, are back in favour, due to the development of new devices and applications. Neuromodulation techniques which are also applicable to this pathology will be the subjet of another article. Pulsed radio-frecuency apperars to favour the safe application of electricity to the dorsal root ganglion or to the root itself thus avoiding the fear of permanent root and/or ganglion thermal lesions that frecuently occurred with the older techniques. Several strategies for pain relief are described, step by step and real figures are depicted in order to make the procedures more understandable and for the easier transmission of knowledge.</dc:description>
