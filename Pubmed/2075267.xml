<dc:description xml:lang="en">A revision of one thousand cases of patients with jaws dysharmonies was made, through clinic cards and x-rays study, to evaluate its prevalence, classification according to angle, frequency in sex, age and teething stage. The results shows us that this dysharmonies are more prevalent in women than in men. At eight years old in both sexes we have the biggest percentage of abnormalities of the jaws, in mixed dentition stage. Angle's class I is present in much more patients than class II, and only a few of cases were class III. The most frequent dysharmonies are compression in male and those in anterior-posterior way in female, and the less one are vertical abnormalities in both sexes.</dc:description>
