<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Leprosy is a widespread infectious disease in humans that is endemic to regions with poor sanitary conditions, especially in cases of overcrowding, malnutrition and bad hygiene. The disease is characterised by dermopathy, which is quite typical, but above all by neuropathy, which often becomes the most important element. In most cases, alterations to nerves are defined by sensory deficits that are predominantly distal and multiple neuritis in areas where nerve entrapment has taken place. CASE REPORTS Two patients, both native Spaniards, presented largely overlapping clinical pictures, that is, a history of 'glove and stocking' type paresthesias and dysesthesias going back months or even years and functional impotence, which gave rise to a very pronounced gait disorder. In the two cases, the immunological situation was determined to be borderline lepromatous leprosy. The neurophysiological study revealed the presence of severe, diffuse sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy that was predominantly distal, and several entrapped nerves. The dermatological illness was greatly improved by the treatment. The same was partially true, although to a satisfactory extent, of the neurological disease. CONCLUSION We describe the cases of two Spaniards with borderline lepromatous leprosy with no past history of the disease, in whom neuropathy was the predominant symptom. We highlight the speed with which the neuropathies progressed, probably due to a change in 'polarity', and the severity of the neurological deficits in comparison with the dermopathy, in an unusual immunological situation. The growing number of native patients in the first world, even when there is no relevant history, suggests that we should not think of leprosy as something only occurring in immigrant patients from places where it is endemic, although the epidemiological relationship has still not been determined.</dc:description>
