<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent degenerative disorders in the population over 65 years. We believe that the prevalence in Spain is between 4-11% for the population over 65 years-old. Drugs are currently available to treat this disease in its different phases. MATERIAL AND METHODS We estimated the prevalence of AD by calculating the defined daily doses per 100 inhabitants over 65 years old and days of dementia drugs (therapeutic group N06DA and N06DX) for the years 2004-2008 for each of the provinces of Castile-La Mancha (Spain). We have provided the data requirements specified by the Regional Health Service of Castile-La Mancha. RESULTS The prevalence of AD is than 2.98 per 100-days for the whole region, there is variation in drug use and consumption, with a predominance of donepezil in all provinces except Guadalajara. On the whole, the consumption of these drugs has increased by 8% annually. CONCLUSIONS The consumption of dementia drugs is used to estimate the distribution of AD in Castile-La Mancha (Spain). These figures do not yet accurately estimate the prevalence of the disease, despite the increase in consumption. We can establish the variability in medical practice for this disease.</dc:description>
