<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To carry out a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of fortified rice consumption in terms of increasing levels of iron and other micro-nutrients in children aged 6-59 months, with a view to evaluating its usefulness as a public health intervention. METHODS A search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and LILACS databases. The review included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that assessed the consumption of fortified rice, compared with a placebo or other forms of intervention, in terms of enhanced levels of iron and other micronutrients. The CONSORT® checklist was used to assess methodological quality. The risk of bias in the studies was assessed using the Cochrane® Collaboration methodology. RESULTS Seven RCTs were included in the review. All the studies showed significant improvements in indicators of nutritional iron status in the intervention groups, without reporting adverse effects. There was no evidence of improvement in vitamin A levels or in anthropometric indicators of weight and height as a secondary result of the intervention. The included studies showed moderate methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS Rice fortification was an effective intervention strategy to correct iron deficiency in children under age 5. For implementation as a public health measure, local studies are needed to assess its effectiveness in long-term and large-scale interventions.</dc:description>
