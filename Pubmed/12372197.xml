<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the impact of admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Andalusia during 2000. METHODS All patients with DRG codes 088 and 541, which would receive ICD-9 codes 491, 492, 493.2, 494 and 496 in the cause of admission field, were extracted from the Minimum Basic Data Set for Andalusia. We compiled descriptive statistics from these data, calculated the cost per day of hospitalization for our own hospital, and then extrapolated to estimate the cost for Andalusia. RESULTS COPD exacerbations generated 10,386 admissions in 2000, leading to 117,011 days of hospitalization. Eighty-three percent of the patients were men and the mean age was 70 12 years. The average hospital stay was 11 10 days. Huelva was the province with the shortest hospital stay (9 days). Mortality was 6.7%. The minimum expenditure generated was E 27 million, not counting the cost of intensive care unit admissions. CONCLUSIONS Admissions due to COPD have great impact on the Andalusian health care system. Further studies are needed to evaluate alternatives to hospitalization.</dc:description>
