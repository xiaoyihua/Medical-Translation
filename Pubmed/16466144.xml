<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Gastroschisis (GS) is a congenital abdominal wall defect that permits bowel exposure to amniotic fluid (AF). Intestinal damage is related to the chemical action of AF and constriction. After birth at term, a thickened intestinal wall with inflammation and, in some cases, intestinal atresias were observed. Surgical repair and intestinal reubication may be difficult, and thus staged silo repair could be necessary. These patients require a long hospital stay owing to bowel damage causing severe intestinal hypoperistalsis and poor absorptive capacity. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is required for a long period. OBJECTIVE The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the benefits of a preterm delivery to avoid bowel damage and its post-natal consequences. PATIENTS AND METHODS Six cases of prenatally-diagnosed GS have been treated following a new strategy since July 2002. A preterm Cesarean section (c-section) delivery was programmed at 34-35 weeks of gestational age (GA). Some hours after birth, at bedside in the NICU, bowel reduction through the defect hole was performed under general anesthesia. This preterm group (PT) was compared the past 6 cases at term (AT) from January 1998 to July 2002. Macroscopic appearance, atresia existence, surgical technique, silo requirement, neonatal outcome, TPN and hospital stay were analyzed. RESULTS All six cases AT (mean GA: 36.3 weeks) presented bowel inflammation and thickened wall. Only 2/6 cases allowed the intestine to be housed in a primary closure after laparotomy. 4/6 cases required staged silo repair. 1 patient presented intestinal atresia and other had perforations who died at 17 days of life from intestinal sepsis. Mean postoperative intubation period was 16.2 days. Mean TPN was 41.2 days and mean hospital stay 69.8 days. PT group was monitored by prenatal sonography seeking bowel sonolucency. After programmed PT c-section delivery (mean GA: 34.8 weeks) in all 6 cases, bowel loops presented normal appearance and intestinal thickening was absent, except in one case. No prematurity-related respiratory complications were observed. Easy bowel reduction without abdominal compression was performed in all cases. 1/6 cases required surgical release of occlusive intestinal adherence. Mean postoperative intubation period was 0.4 days (9.6 hours). Oral feeding was started at 6 days. Mean TPN was 13.4 days and mean hospital stay 28.6 days. CONCLUSIONS The third trimester is a critical period for fetal bowel development. Intestinal damage rises with increasing exposure time to amniotic fluid. This strategy of preterm delivery for the treatment of GS avoids intestinal damage, prevents "peel" and intestinal atresia, renders surgical reduction easier, reduces the hypoperistalsis, need for TPN and hospital stay. Multidisciplinary coordination between obstetricians, neonatologists and pediatric surgeons is required.</dc:description>
