<dc:description xml:lang="en">Longitudinal distribution of Plecoptera species were examined along the Sierra Nevada National Park in the Andean region of Merida State, Venezuela. PNSN is one of the largest protected areas and consists of two major sub-basins. Quantitative samples were collected in 7 river tributaries along the PNSN from February to May of 2009, and a total of 135 individuals and 4 species of the genus Anacroneuria were collected. Only three rivers (Nuestra Señora, La Picón y Corcovada) found the presence of stoneflies, the principal component analysis show that the characterization of habitat, current velocity, dissolved oxygen and the absence of human disturbance sources of influence in a suitable habitat for populations. Stoneflies are endangered or have become extinct throughout much of its range due to human activities. Conservation plans must be implemented urgently, in order to avoid recreational areas and/or economic in vicinity thereof.</dc:description>
