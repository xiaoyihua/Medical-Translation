<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To analyse the results of the therapy administered to children with ALL in Cuba. PATIENTS AND METHODS Four-hundred and twenty-five children (aged below 15 years), diagnosed of ALL in 8 different Cuban hospitals between 1973 and 1991, were evaluated. Five different therapeutic regimes were used: three "classic" GLATHEM protocols in the first period (1973-1981) and two intensive BFM-like protocols in the second period (1982-1991). The Kaplan-Meier method was applied for survival analysis, and the differences were evaluated by the log-rank and Mantel-Cox methods. RESULTS Two-hundred and sixty-five patients were included in the first period, 81 with low-risk disease, 133 with standard risk and 51 with poor-risk leukaemia. The second period comprised 160 cases, 50 of low-risk, 83 with standard risk and 27 with poor-risk leukaemia. The disease-free survival probability at 60 months was 35% for the first group and 55% for the second (p &lt; 0.0001). The 60-month survival (SV) as a whole was 45% for the "classic" treatments and 60% for the BFM-like protocols (p &lt; 0.01). The disease-free survival (DFS) probability for each prognostic group was as follows: 50% for low-risk, 43% for standard risk, and 25% for poor-risk (p &lt; 0.001) and the probability of survival as a whole was, respectively, 65%, 49% and 28% (p &lt; 0.001). as for this compilation, 172 patients were out of any treatment for periods ranging between 14 and 168 months. CONCLUSIONS 1) The percentage of remissions was similar for both groups of treatments. 2) The results attained with BFM-like protocols were better than those of the "classic" therapy with regard to the SV and DFS differences. 3) Significant differences can be appreciated between good- and poor-prognosis groups for both types of treatment.</dc:description>
