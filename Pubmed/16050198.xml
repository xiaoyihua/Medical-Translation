<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To provide descriptive information on site-specific urological cancer occurrence we computed 10-year cancer incidence rates in the geographic area of Getafe (Madrid, Spain, 300,000 people). MATERIALS AND METHODS Only histologically confirmed genitourinary cancer (bladder, prostate, kidney, testicle and penis) throughout 1992-2001 was considered. Cancers were classified according to the international rules. 10 years age-standardized population-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 people (or per 100,000 men when appropriate) were calculated. Overall and cancer-specific yearly increments were also evaluated. The most recent release of National Statistics (2001) was used for population adjusting. RESULTS Prostate cancer (PC) accounted for the majority of diagnostics. A strong correlation was detected between the total number of new cancer diagnostics and the overall population. While the correlation was frail between the number of new cancer diagnostics in females and the female population, the association remained significant in males. Nevertheless, only the number of new prostate cancer diagnostics was firmly and significantly associated with the population. CONCLUSIONS Incidence rates of every cancer type increased throughout the last decade. Nevertheless, this increases didn't parallel the population increment perhaps translating environmental factors.</dc:description>
