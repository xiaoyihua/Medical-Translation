<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION One of the most frequent complications of vascular encephalopathies is the onset of cognitive disorders that lead the patient to a progressive decay of his abilities and useful life. Being high blood pressure (HBP) one of the most important causes of brain vascular disorders, we studied some aspects of cognition in HBP patients without neurological manifestations and with normal scores in Mini Mental State Examination. PATIENTS AND METHODS There were studied 84 uncomplicated hypertensive patients, with a normal neurological physical examination and a group of 35 functionally healthy subjects. The patients were divided into three groups: slight high blood pressure (SLHBP, n = 24 age, 49 +/- 4) with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 90 and 100 mmHg, moderate high blood pressure (MHBP, n = 40, age 51 +/- 6) with DBP between 101 and 114 mmHg, and severe high blood pressure (SHBP, n = 20, age 49 +/- 8) with DBP of 115 mmHg or higher. All subjects underwent visual and auditory P300 evoked potentials. RESULTS Visual and auditory P300 wave showed global latency delay, and amplitude decrease and absence of response in different leads, especially in frontal regions, higher in SHBP patients. This absence of response was more evident in auditory P300 in all patient groups. CONCLUSION It is remarkable that neurologically asymptomatic HBP patients have P300 alterations with regional focalization, possibly due to a functional disorder related to hemodynamic changes in the central nervous system.</dc:description>
