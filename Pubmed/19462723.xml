<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The standard treatment of small renal masses is partial nephrectomy, which has showed similar oncologic results when compared with radical nephrectomy. Recently, ablative techniques, including radiofrequency and cryotherapy ablation, has been developed, with the purpose of minimizing adverse effects of standard surgical excision. In this article we review the technique of radiofrequency ablation. MATERIAL AND METHODS For this review we conducted a search in the Medline database using the terms "renal radiofrequency ablation". RESULTS The different currently marketed systems for the delivery of radiofrequency energy are examined. The different techniques of delivery (open, laparoscopic and percutaneous) are described; we observe a trend towards the use of the percutaneous method. Among the published clinical studies there are series of patients with midterm follow-up (3 years) that show oncologic outcomes similar to traditional resection techniques, with fewer complications. CONCLUSIONS Renal tumor radiofrequency ablation has proved an effective therapy with minimal complications. However, it should be used only in selected patients until longer follow-up studies are available.</dc:description>
