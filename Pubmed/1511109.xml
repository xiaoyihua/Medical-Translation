<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the different "costings" of several different strategies for gathering a Minimum Set of Data (MSD) at the Primary Care level. DESIGN A simulation study using a hypothetical MSD with 16 items together with the findings on demand and interventions made by General Physicians in an observational study in Andorra. Different gathering strategies were applied using these data and with the MSD register covering visits as the starting-point. Measurement of the "costing" or work-load involved in the gathering and transmission of each of the items was carried out by means of a nominal group. SITE. General and paediatric consulting-rooms. PATIENTS OR OTHERS PARTICIPANTS The simulation was carried out among the catchment population of PAMEM and used data on what was done in 1988. MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Strategies based on sampling of visits or individuals are those which show a greater reduction in cost (99.3% and 98.1% respectively). Sampling individuals additionally allows for the MSD to be added to during periods of illness. Other options with their respective results are: "gathering information from alternative sources", with a reduction of 22%, "reduction of the number of data to record", with 20% reduction and "separation of stable information" with 18%. CONCLUSIONS The systematic collection of data on each visit has important and much more efficient alternatives. The choice of one of them will depend on how feasible it is to introduce, on the available resources and above all on objectives.</dc:description>
