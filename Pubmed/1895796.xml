<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In individuals with HIV infection, extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis are considered as opportunistic infections and are included in the diagnosis of AIDS. They often have atypical clinical features. Abdominal participation is uncommon and its diagnosis may be difficult. METHODS The clinical, radiological and pathological features of patients with a diagnosis of AIDS with abdominal tuberculosis in a series of 254 AIDS cases in a general hospital from 1984 to October 1990 were reviewed. RESULTS Tuberculosis developed in 104 (41%) of AIDS patients. In 25 (24%) the disease was exclusively pleuropulmonary and in 79 (76%) extrapulmonary tuberculosis was present, either alone or in association. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis was the first opportunistic infection in 66 AIDS cases (26%). The abdominal participation was demonstrated in 19 patients, with the following localizations: lymph nodes (9), liver (8), spleen (5), ileum (1) and peritoneum (1). Four patients with splenic tuberculosis also had multifocal nodular lesions. CONCLUSIONS Abdominal participation was found in 19 of the 104 AIDS patients with tuberculosis (18%). Lymph node involvement was the most common type. Hepatosplenic tuberculosis had a miliary form or showed multifocal images in echography or computed tomography.</dc:description>
