<dc:description xml:lang="en">Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most frequent neoplasm found in AIDS patients. The disease is often disseminated and preferentially involves the skin and the lymphatic and digestive systems. Hepatosplenic involvement which is considered as a frequent autopsy finding is rarely diagnosed at life. A 27-year-old male HIV positive patient with severe immunosuppression who developed a rapidly progressive laterocervical cutaneous KS confirmed by pathologic study is presented. Abdominal echography and thoracoabdominal CT scand demonstrated lesions highly suggestive of pulmonary, lymph node, hepatic, splenic and rectal involvement by KS. The administration of 2 chemotherapy cycles produced subjective improvement and remission of the cutaneous lesions. Severe pulmonary superinfection led to death. An autopsy study was not performed. Hepatosplenic involvement by KS, diagnosed while the patient is alive is rare. The imaging techniques are useful to diagnose with high probability visceral involvement of KS. Systemic searching for visceral involvement in KS patients would lead to a marked increase in the cases such as that herein described with evident therapeutic and prognostic implications.</dc:description>
