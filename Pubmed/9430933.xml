<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The adverse effects of cocaine use mainly occur in the heart and central nervous system. AIM To study the effects of cocaine base paste consumption on the cardiovascular system. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Thirty five chronic cocaine base paste consumers, 26 male, aged 15 to 43 years old, were studied. A clinical assessment and a resting EKG were performed. Results were compared with those of 82 healthy controls. RESULTS Sixty percent of cocaine consumers had EKG abnormalities, compared with 43% of controls. Forty one percent of cocaine users and 33% of controls had a prolonged QTc. Likewise, 36% of cocaine users and 46% of controls had an incomplete right bundle branch block. Among cocaine users, an active nodal rhythm, an ischemic and a QS anteroseptal image were observed. CONCLUSIONS A slightly higher frequency of EKG abnormalities were observed in chronic cocaine users, when compared with healthy controls.</dc:description>
