<dc:description xml:lang="en">Effective clinical teaching is an imperative of medical education. Clinical teachers and faculty development initiatives as well as Medical Schools, need to focus their efforts to pursue common outcomes: effective learning in students, future competent physicians and healthy patients. Excellence in quality of teaching needs scholars in education. To achieve this objective, institutions must recruit a core of medical faculty according to its mission, define the attributes and teaching competences, implement faculty development programs, and finally, support academic vitality. This article describes the three main issues of medical teaching: faculty, faculty development and its organization.</dc:description>
