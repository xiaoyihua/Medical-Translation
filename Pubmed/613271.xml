<dc:description xml:lang="en">Some of the personality traits characteristic of adolescents and addicts that influence the drawing up of an "ad hoc" program treatment are briefly established. The fact that organic physical-chemical therapies are almost useless in these cases is discussed, emphasizing good results obtained by psychotherapeutic methods, mainly group therapy; also mentioned are some changes to be considered in view of the drug addiction; these changes would include the use of paraprofessional personnel. Some of the outstanding characteristics of the addict-psychotherapy are established, mainly: the therapist's activity, emphasis on reparative action, the setting of limits and the patients' regressiveness. Also discussed are the basic points of resistance to change, grouped under the headings of "internal", "family" and "gang" saboteur, detailing each case.</dc:description>
