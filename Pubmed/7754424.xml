<dc:description xml:lang="en">A census of private health establishments was carried out by the Secretary of Health, in order to quantify its resources and to describe their geographical distribution. The census, conducted in 1994, was limited to private units which offered hospitalization services, and the reference period was the previous year. Results showed that there are 2,723 private hospitalization units in Mexico, and nearly a half of the units are concentrated in the Federal District, and the states of Mexico, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Baja California and Veracruz. The number of private hospitalization beds registered in the country are 33,937, these figures indicate that private medicine is the main hospital care provider in the national health system. Similar results were obtained regarding other material and human resources. It is important to stress the need for further research regarding the role of private medicine in Mexico, including aspects related to the quality of the services being provided.</dc:description>
