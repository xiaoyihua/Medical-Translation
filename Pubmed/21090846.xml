<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To ascertain medical criteria and their priority in the allocation of deceased patient kidneys in pediatrics among members of Internal Transplant Committees of six hospitals. To assess if, by using the Delphi method, it is possible to reach consensus to reduce heterogeneity of criteria in the allocation of renal transplant organs among physicians ascribed to Nephrology and Surgery services in six hospital centers in Mexico. METHODOLOGY A study was carried out by the Delphi method of independent experts panel, with three stages and two rounds. The method makes possible iteration and controlled feedback from experts to identify behaviors and trends with the synergy of the debate in a group. Kappa index was applied to assess results agreement. RESULTS Results of first round show the criteria heterogeneity for the allocation of cadaveric origin organs within each hospital, and among hospitals compared to each other. With the results of the second round, consensus increased in four hospitals for the selection of both first and second recipient. Kappa coefficient shows the reliability of results. CONCLUSION Our Country needs a point-score system to allocate deceased donor organs, ideally including HLA matching. Expecting that the Internal Transplant Committees throughout the Mexican territory may have available a useful tool as this, the Delphi method makes it possible to reach consensus in this task, in order to minimize subjectivity in the staff involved in the decision-making process.</dc:description>
