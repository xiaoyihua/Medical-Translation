<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse physicians', pharmacists' and nurses' perspectives on the importance of different antiretroviral treatment adherence support activities and identify the main obstacles to meeting established recommendations which health professionals encounter. METHOD Cross-sectional observational and analytical study. Three questionnaires were designed based on 2008 GESIDA/SEFH/PNS recommendations for improving treatment adherence: "ideal measures" (IM), "real measures" (RM) and "adherence support problems" (ASP). Cronbach's Alpha index was determined to analyse questionnaire reliability and correlation coefficients between the MI and MR scales. We applied the Chi-square test or Monte Carlo method to analyse the correlation between health providers and items on the three questionnaires. RESULTS Participants consisted of 58 health professionals. The response rate was 76%. The Cronbach Alpha indices for the IM, RM and ASP questionnaires were 0.852, 0.933 and 0.818 respectively. The resulting intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.280. Significant differences were found for multiple comparisons of IM and RM questionnaires among physicians and pharmacists. The analysis of relationships between providers also found significant differences for one of the answers on the IM questionnaire, three on the RM and five on the ASP. CONCLUSIONS We observed that several health professionals have different perspectives on measures of support for treatment adherence, with differences arising mainly due to lack of time and training.</dc:description>
