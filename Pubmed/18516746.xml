<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Pituitary apoplexy is a rare clinical entity. It is a rare cause of stroke, whose pathogenic mechanism has not been fully understood. Compression in intracavernous carotid artery and vasospastic mechanism have been described. It may initially begin as a meningeal syndrome, in which neuroimaging techniques may be fundamental, above all resonance magnetic imaging for a correct diagnosis of the disease and its complications. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 23 year-old male who suffered a massive stroke due to bilateral carotid compression in its intracavernous portion due to apoplexy of a previously unknown pituitary tumor. The diffusion sequences and acute angioresonance of the circle of Willis are presented. CONCLUSIONS This is a rare entity with controversial management. An exhaustive review of cases and series of patients with pituitary apoplexy related stroke is also presented.</dc:description>
