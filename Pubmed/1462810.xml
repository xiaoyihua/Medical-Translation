<dc:description xml:lang="en">The microscopic patterns adopted by prostate carcinomas are extraordinarily variable making its histopathological classification and grading extremely complicated. There are numerous systems for prostatic tumours' grading, but many of them lack a truly reproducible character and an acceptable degree of reliability; for this reason, we have studied a series of nuclear microscopic parameters, from a quantitative point of view, in a series of prostatic carcinomas with a minimum follow-up of five years. It was observed that of the morphometric values obtained--area, perimeter, projection on the X- and Y-axis as well as the nuclear roundness factor--the most useful and representative is the latter. Besides, this is an objective parameter to evaluate nuclear anaplasia and can also be considered as a prognostic factor since, in our series, those who died had a greater mean nuclear roundness factor than those who survived.</dc:description>
