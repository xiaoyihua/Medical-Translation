<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Chylopericardium is a rare occurrence in children. The most common causes are associated with cardiac surgery, malformations of the lymphatic system, idiopathic reasons, among others. OBJECTIVE The case is presented of a patient with traumatic chylopericardium, the diagnostic methodology, and in particular, its successful resolution by surgical means. CLINICAL CASE Male patient of 6 years old, previous accident of fall from patient's height. Chest x-ray showed evidence of cardiomegaly. An echocardiogram with pericardial effusion was performed. Pericardial puncture was performed with drainage of milky material, confirming chylous liquid. Treatment included pericardial catheterisation, total parenteral nutrition, octreotide, and diet with medium chain triglycerides, with persistent increased pericardial fluid. Lymphatic abnormalities were ruled out by MRI. He underwent surgical treatment due to failure of prior treatment. A thoracoscopic approach was adopted with a favourable outcome. CONCLUSIONS Chylopericardium occurs in children in most cases after cardiovascular surgery. The case presented here was classified as idiopathic. Patients with this condition may present with severe symptoms, such as tamponade, or can be asymptomatic as in the case presented. If medical treatment fails, it should be resolved by surgery; the best choice is minimally invasive treatment with its well-known advantages.</dc:description>
