<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To determine the safety and acceptance of outpatient liver biopsies. PATIENTS AND METHODS Data from all liver biopsies were collected in a prospective way over a period of 18 months. Information was gathered on complications, evolution of patients outside the hospital and opinion relating to the test. All patients were required to previously present: platelet count &gt; 60.000/mm3 prothrombin time within 4 seconds of control and absence of ascites or encephalopathy. Criteria for outpatient liver biopsy also included cooperative patient, a partner or friend who stayed with the patient during 12-24 hours following the test and easy access to the hospital. Out of a total of 378 biopsies, 264 (70%) were ambulatory. RESULTS Five of the 264 outpatients were hospitalized (1.9%), due to a subcapsular hematoma in one case, persistent pain in 3 cases and sever hypotension in the other; all of them evolved favorably in the first 24 hours. Among the inpatients, 2 had complications (1.7%): one subcapsular hematoma resolved without treatment and one abdominal hemorrhage requiring transfusion. Of the ambulatory patients, 46 (18%) presented pain whilst at home, being more frequent in females than in males (30% vs 15%, p = 0.004) and in those who needed more than one attempt to obtain histological material compared with those of a single attempt (33% vs 17%; p = 0.008). Twenty four hours after the test, 83% of the patients had returned to their normal activities. Ninety five percent of the patients questioned considered that the test was not traumatic, and 88% stated a preference for liver biopsy as a day case procedure. CONCLUSIONS Liver biopsy performed on an ambulatory basis is safe, well tolerated and acceptable by the majority of patients.</dc:description>
