<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES First, to assess knowledge and attitudes of people aged 65 and over to the Advance Directives Document (ADD) and know the role that, in their opinion, a family doctor should play in the early planning of death. Second, to assess the level of knowledge and attitude of primary care physicians to that document, as well as to know the role played by these professionals. DESIGN Qualitative, using discussion groups. Between March and May 2009 4 groups, 2 of physicians and 2 of older people, were formed. SETTING Castile-La Mancha Primary Care Setting, Albacete and Guadalajara health areas. SUBJECTS 15 people in the groups formed by older people and 13 in the groups of doctors. METHOD The Krueger recommendations (1991) were followed both for the selection of subjects, conducting of the discussion groups and analysis of data. RESULTS Doctors and patients have a positive attitude towards the ADD, but lack sufficient information to make more widespread use of it. Ignorance makes it impossible for patients to get information about the document and the lack of time makes it difficult for physicians to raise the issue in the consultation. CONCLUSIONS Neither physicians nor the elderly have enough information regarding ADD, allowing us to recommend carrying out information campaigns and/or specific educational activities. According to physicians, alternatives to primary care consultations should be sought for patients to be informed.</dc:description>
