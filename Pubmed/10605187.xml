<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The re-emergence of bacterial diseases and their negative consequences in terms of health and economic cost, have made this issue an important public health problem. The objective of this work is to review the economic literature about antibiotic resistance, and to suggest possible solutions in our health care context aimed to reduce their negative impact. METHODS We made a bibliographic search in the main biomedical databases. Economic assessment studies published in Spanish, English, French or Italian and related to the appearance of antibiotic resistance were selected. Their main methodological characteristics and results were analysed. RESULTS Two studies analysing the economic impact of the appearance of antibiotic resistance were identified. A minimum hospital cost of 1300 million dollars (in 1992), and a social cost between 100 and 30,000 million dollars (in 1989) were estimated. CONCLUSIONS Economic analysis allows to quantify and assess the impact of several management strategies in relation with antibiotic administration, in terms of health and costs, and to choose the most cost-effective strategies. The identification of inappropriate consumption of antibiotics as a cause of a negative externality upon the rest of the society is basic to make health care professionals and public opinion conscious about this problem, and to develop strategies to reduce its negative impact.</dc:description>
