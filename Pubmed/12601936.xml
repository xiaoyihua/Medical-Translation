<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Testicular cancer in adult and young patients with cryptorchidism (operated or not operated on) has been reported previously, but its epidemiological impact (as concept to profile cancer and/or therapeutical result of cryptorchidism based on quantitative dates) is not defined actually. OBJECTIVE Determination by quantitative meta-analysis of the strength of relation (relative risk = RR) cancer and cryptorchidism and by qualitative meta-analysis of factors of cryptorchidism (anatomical position of teste, age of intervention, testicular biopsy) associated to cancer. RESULTS Case-control and cohort studies of medical literature have been included in this report. Relative risk of develop cancer in the patient with cryptorchidism is 7.75 more than poblational control without cryptorchidism (interval of confiance: 5.2-10.3). Qualitative meta-analysis of factors concluded that there is a significative relation cancer and abdominal position of teste, and also age of intervention after 10 and testicular biopsy. CONCLUSIONS Significative relation between cancer and cryptorchidism with relative risk above control population is constated again, although with dates without epidemiological importance. But significative relation among cancer with abdominal testes and intervention after 10 years would recommend prospective studies, with strategy of multivariant analysis. Authors recommend not to make testicular biopsy, except if its indication is not questionable.</dc:description>
