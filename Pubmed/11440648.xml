<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify the areas of activity in which the Valencia Society of Family and Community Medicine (SVMFyC) should become involved over the next four years. DESIGN Qualitative research.Setting. SVMFyC members. PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS 27 experts belonging to the SVMFyC took part. INTERVENTIONS Qualitative consensus-seeking techniques. Reliability and validity of the technique were ensured through triangulation and the selection of experts from among the different professional groups within the SVMFyC. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS To determine the recommended lines of action, productivity, spontaneous representativity, intensity of recommendation and degree of agreement were analysed. The priority lines recommended were: defending the MIR path, proposing reforms in undergraduate study plans, watching over the transparency of job selection procedures and the annual OPE selection, promoting the professional degree course, creation of posts for teachers in family and community medicine, defining the size of the population registered with a doctor, proposing an incentives list and studying alternatives to uniform salaries in the form of target-linked remuneration. CONCLUSIONS The lines of action recommended by the experts were established.</dc:description>
