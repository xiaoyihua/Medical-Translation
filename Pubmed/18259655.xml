<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In pulmonary embolism, the computed tomography (CT) images can be used as a prognostic index measuring the embolic load, according to the location and size of thrombus and the right/left ventricular diameter ratio. AIM To assess the predictive value of embolic load and right/left ventricular diameter ratio for early and late mortality in acute pulmonary embolism (PTE). MATERIAL AND METHODS The pulmonary CT of 418 patients with suspected PTE was reviewed. Embolic load was assessed by three independent evaluators and the right/left ventricular diameter ratio was measured in those exams that were positive for PTE. A logistic regression analysis was done between these parameters and mortality. Reproducibility was calculated using Bland and Altman analysis. RESULTS There was a high concordance between raters to calculate embolic load (r =0,95, p &lt;0,001). Only the right/left ventricular diameter ratio and the presence were predictive of global mortality. The predictive value for embolic load was below the significance level, No parameter was predictive of early mortality. CONCLUSIONS The concordance between raters for the assessment of embolic load was high in this study. However no imaging parameter had a predictive value for early mortality. The right/left ventricular diameter ratio had a predictive value for global mortality at three months.</dc:description>
