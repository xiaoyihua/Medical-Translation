<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS To know the characteristics and prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection infection in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective descriptive study of NCFB adult patients whose disease had been followed-up for at least two years was performed. RESULTS A total of 68 subjects were included, 50 females (73.5%), with mean age of 63.31± 16.2 years. The most frequent etiology of the non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis was COPD in 28 cases (41.2%) with a light-moderate pulmonary involvement and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) colonization (70.6%). Seven patients (10.3%) had MNT infection, six of whom had Mycobacterium avium complex (7.35%). Four patients (57.14%) were treated. In the infected patients, P. aeruginosa and the use of inhaled steroids were observed with less frequency. There were no significant differences between the infected and non-infected patients in relation to spirometric values. CONCLUSIONS The non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis could be considered a risk factor for non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection.</dc:description>
