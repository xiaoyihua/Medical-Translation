<dc:description xml:lang="en">A prospective study was realized with the purpose of evaluating the efficiency of the excisional therapy of the electrosurgery in the treatment of the High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (H.G.S.L.I.) of the cervix. 149 patients who were attended at the colposcopy service with this diagnosis were selected during September 1990 to April 1993. The procedure was realized in 37 patients 24.8% in the operating room and in 112 patients (75.2% in the outpatient room with local anaesthesia. With this last mentioned method in 93.8% not one type of trouble was presented, referring only a slightly to moderate pain in 6.2%. The transoperatory complications were bleeding on the surgical site in 3.3% which was solved at the moment through local electrocoagulation, and late bleeding present in 4.2% of the patients. The lesion was completely eliminated when the deepness of the cone corresponded to 1.81 cm in 139 cases (93.29%). Through a colpo-cytologic follow-up in 24 months, a persistence of the virus of the human papilloma was shown in 5.5% during the first nine months and appearance of one case of H.G.S.I.L. after 18 months. Therefore, these results had a therapeutic efficiency of the global follow-up of 90.08%.</dc:description>
