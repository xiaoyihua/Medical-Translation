<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease is a major neuropsychiatric complication; it has been reported that 60% of patients will develop psychosis during the disease evolution. Its pathophysiology is multifactorial and clinically psychotic phenomena include minor hallucinations and confusional states. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study in patients with Parkinson's disease from a tertiary hospital using a thoughtful neurological and neuropsychiatric evaluation along with specific scales for non-motor symptoms, depression, cognition, and presence and severity of psychotic symptoms and hallucinations. RESULTS We included a total of 236 patients with Parkinson's disease, of which 33 (13.9%) patients met the criteria for psychosis at the time of the evaluation. Visual hallucinations were the most common symptom. Age (p = 0.004), age at onset of the disease (p = 0.007) and its duration (p = 0.004), use of levodopa (p = 0.02), and use of amantadine (p = 0.004) were the main factors associated with the presence of psychosis. CONCLUSION Psychosis in Parkinson's disease is a relatively common manifestation and is mainly associated with clinical and demographic factors. Early recognition will optimize management and improve the quality of life of patients and their caregivers.</dc:description>
