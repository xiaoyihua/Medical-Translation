<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to analyze the productivity and visibility of Spanish authors in gastroenterology and hepatology between 2000 and 2009 and to compare the results with those for other countries. METHODS The Web of Science database was used. The analysis (annual and 5-yearly) was restricted to citable documents. The bibliometric indicators used were the number of documents published, the total number of citations received, the median and interquartile range of the citations received and the Hirsch h index. RESULTS We identified 82,740 documents, with an increase of 18.2% between 5-year periods. Seventeen countries published more than 1,000 documents in the decade and received more than 20,000 citations. A total of 14.5% of the documents were international collaborations (20.6% of all citations) and 37.3% were published in journals in the first quartile (66.3% of all citations). The median number of citations received by all the publications was 9 (interquartile range: 3-21) and their h index was 246. Spain ranked ninth for the number of documents and eighth for citations received and for the h index. The countries showing the greatest increase in the percentage of citations contributing to the world total were Canada and Spain, with an increase between 5-yearly periods of 1.16% and 0.95%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS From 2000 to 2009, the production of Spanish authors in gastroenterology and hepatology was high, achieving a notable position in the total number of citations received.</dc:description>
