<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Despite the development of potent, new antiviral drugs, the percentage of HBeAg seroconversion is approximately 35%. Immunosuppression before antiviral administration has recently been investigated with contradictory results. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of lamivudine and interferon alfa-2b with prior immunosuppression with prednisone in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB). METHODS A randomized controlled study was conducted in a sample of 44 patients with HBeAg-positive CHB and persistently elevated alanine transferase (ALT) levels. The patients were distributed into two groups: 22 patients received prednisone 40 mg daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks without treatment, and lamivudine 150 mg daily for 4 weeks; lamivudine plus interferon alfa 2b (10 MIU every other day) was then administered for 24 weeks followed by continuous lamivudine 150 mg daily to complete 58 weeks. A further 22 patients received the same treatment regimen and duration, but without prednisone. RESULTS Virologic response defined as HBeAg seroconversion plus a decrease of serum HBV DNA &lt; 105 copies/ml 24 weeks after concluding the treatment was observed in 68% of the patients receiving previous immunosuppression compared with 54% of the control group (p = 0.26). Forty-five percent of patients with prednisone priming showed histologic improvement compared with 23% of the control group (p = 0.10). A significant proportion of patient with previous immunosuppression showed improvement in necroinflammatory activity (45% vs 23%) and fibrosis (50 vs 23%) compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS Virologic response was clinically, but not statistically, superior in the group with prednisone priming. Histologic improvement was notable in the group with previous immunosuppression.</dc:description>
