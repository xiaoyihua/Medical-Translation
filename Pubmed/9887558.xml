<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To review our series of urethral diverticulum in the male, an uncommon condition whose etiology continues to be a subject of discussion. The clinical features, diagnostic methods and treatment are analyzed. METHODS A 10-year retrospective study was conducted at our hospital. The etiopathogenic factors, risk factors, presenting features, methods of diagnosis, treatment, postoperative and non-surgical complications (lithiasis, intradiverticular tumors...) were analyzed. RESULTS Only six cases of diverticulum of the male urethra were found and were mainly of acquired origin. Recurrent infection was the most common clinical presentation. Patients were evaluated by voiding and retrograde cystourethrography. All patients underwent surgery. Postoperative control evaluation was performed by cystourethrography. The surgical complication rate was low. CONCLUSIONS Diverticulum of the male urethra is an uncommon urological disease whose etiopathogenesis has as yet to be established, although it is accepted to be predominantly of acquired origin. Its clinical features are unspecific, for which reason it should be considered when making a diagnosis. Although transrectal ultrasound appears to be useful, diverticulum of the male urethra is usually diagnosed by conventional cystourethrography. Treatment is by endoscopic or open surgery, which achieves good results.</dc:description>
