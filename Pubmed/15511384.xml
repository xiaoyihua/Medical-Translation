<dc:description xml:lang="en">The coagulation cascade leads, via thrombin activation, to the formation of fibrin (from its precursor fibrinogen) and platelet thrombus. Several drugs are able to interfere with some of the enzymatic factors involved in thrombin activation, but thrombin inhibitors (heparin, hirudin and hirulog [bivalirudin]) are of particular interest because they disrupt the coagulation cascade by acting upon one of its final steps. Among the thrombin inhibitors, oral antithrombins (ximelagatran) appear to hold great promise for the control of thrombogenicity in a number of clinical contexts. Oral antithrombins do not require the participation of cofactors to exert their action, and in contrast to thrombin inhibitors administered parenterally, they bind specifically to the active site of thrombin without interfering with other portions of the molecule. Their specificity makes these drugs safe and obviates the need to monitor coagulability. Moreover, they show a low rate of interaction with other drugs or with foods, and the response to fixed doses is predictable. A number of clinical studies have investigated antithrombins for prophylaxis prior to orthopedic surgery, in the prevention of cerebrovascular accidents associated with atrial fibrillation, and in the control of coronary artery disease. These studies have shown that antithrombins are superior to other habitually used treatment options. Surprisingly, their use in long-term studies has not been associated with an increased rate of bleeding events. Their interesting molecular characteristics and considerable therapeutic efficacy and safety suggest that oral antithrombins will in the near future become a valuable therapeutic option.</dc:description>
