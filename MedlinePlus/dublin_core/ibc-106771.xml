<dc:description xml:lang="es">Introduction: ATtention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral disorder in children and adolescents. However there are not studies about this condition from the standpoint of the primary care pediatrician. Material and methods: on July 2011 the patients with the diagnosis of AHDH and between 6 to 12 years of age were selected at the Catarroja Health Center (Valencia). Patient data from the clinical history were recorded and who was the professional that made the diagnosis, treatment and follow up. Results: forty-seven children were diagnosed of ADHD from a total of 2466 (prevalence rate 1.9%). Most of them were referred from the primary care pediatrician to the pediatric neurologist of psychiatrist. The most common treatment was methylphenidate followed by atomexetine. Complementary test were performed in 32% of the patients to rule out alternative causes for the symptoms. The coexisting conditions found were similar to other reports. The outcome of the patients, when reporte, was satisfactory in most of them (36%). Conclusion: the prevalence found in our area is low, probably due to the study design. PAtients are diagnosed and treated frequently by the pediatric neurologist or psychiatrist. Some of the cases are treated by the pediatrician, tendency that we hope to be increased(AU)</dc:description>
