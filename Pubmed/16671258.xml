<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Succinylcholine (SCH) may first be used and continue with mivacurium (MIV). MIV has been suggested as a pretreatment. Conflicting results arises from studies on SCH-MIV interaction. The following trial revisits this interaction. PATIENTS AND METHODS The patients were intubated after randomized administration of 100 microg x Kg(-1) of mivacurium (group 1) or 1 mg x Kg(-1) of succinylcholine and, after 50% recovery, 100 microg x Kg(-1) of mivacurium (group 2). A third group received the same regimen as group 2, preceded by pretreatment with 10 microg x Kg(-1) of mivacurium. Maximum effect (MAX), onset time, the 10%-25% recovery index, and duration of effect of mivacurium were determined by electromyography. In groups 2 and 3, the corrected MAX was defined as the difference between the actual MAX effect and the residual block after administration of succinylcholine, and speed of action was defined as the ratio between MAX or corrected MAX and onset time. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls and t tests for bivariate comparisons. A value of P less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Groups 2 and 3 had significantly greater MAX effects (97% and 98%, respectively) in comparison with group 1 (93%), shorter onset times (135 and 158 seconds in groups 2 and 3 vs 279 seconds in group 1), and greater speed of action without changes in duration of effect. MAX was halved when corrected (to 47% and 49% in groups 2 and 3, respectively), and speed of action was significantly reduced (from 1.34 and 1.62 seconds/% in groups 2 and 3 respectively, to 2.69 and 3.36 seconds/%). Mivacurium pretreatment did not produce relevant clinical changes. CONCLUSIONS When mivacurium is used before the effects of succinylcholine disappear, a residual effect is not usually taken into consideration. This study corrected MAX and calculated speed of action, demonstrating a reduction in net block and speed of action, consistent with an antagonistic action when the 2 blockers are administered sequentially.</dc:description>
