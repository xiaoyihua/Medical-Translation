<dc:description xml:lang="en">This quantitative, prospective study, aimed to characterize the profile of users and caregivers and to measure the incidence of gastric extubation, identifying the type and the reasons for the extubation of these users in a Home Care Program of a university hospital. The population consisted of 37 subjects and the data were collected from April to August 2010. For the analysis, descriptive statistics, test of significance of 5% and calculation of indicators were adopted. It was found that 51.4% of the users were female, 67.5% in the age group &gt;60 years and 67.6% presented neurological diseases. Regarding the caregivers 89.2% were female and their mean age was 50.6 years. The incidence of extubation, considering 100 days of intubation, corresponded to 1.08, with 0.26 planned and 0.82 unplanned (p=0.009). These results allowed the rates to be calculated of the extubation of patients with gastric intubation for nutritional support in domicile care, providing support in establishing care and management goals for the continuous improvement of quality.</dc:description>
