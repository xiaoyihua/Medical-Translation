<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to describe our experience in managing the new adult color model of the Lo-Pro GlideScope in a diverse group of patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective, descriptive study of 350 ASA 1-5 patients who underwent oral or nasal tracheal intubation with the Lo-Pro Adult Color GlideScope. Patients whose maximum mouth opening was inadequate were excluded. We recorded the following data: demographic variables, predictors of difficult direct laryngoscopy, Cormack-Lehane grade, presence of morbid obesity, adjusting maneuvers required, intubations in awake patients, intubations with a selective double lumen tube, rescues of failed intubations, oropharyngeal lesions, postoperative sore throat, and failed intubation. RESULTS Cormack-Lehane grade was 1 in 80.6% of the cases, 2 in 16.9%, and 3 in 2.6%. There were no Cormack-Lehane 4 patients. Rotation of the tube was necessary when entering the glottis in 38%. There were no significant differences in the incidence of oropharyngeal lesions between oral and nasal intubations. There were no abandoned attempts. CONCLUSIONS The rate of successful tracheal intubation is high with the new Lo-Pro Adult Color GlideScope when it is used by trained staff, even in patients with difficult airways. It is also a useful device for intubating awake patients.</dc:description>
