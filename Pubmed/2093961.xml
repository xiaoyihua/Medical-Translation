<dc:description xml:lang="en">Our series includes the first 19 consecutive patients with pulmonary valvar stenosis who underwent balloon valvuloplasty in our hospital. All of them have been evaluated by an echo-Doppler study at different follow-up times, and in 10 patients the study was also performed prior to the dilatation. The ages ranged between 0.4 and 10 years (mean 3.5 years; standard deviation [SD] 2.53 years). The prevalvuloplasty degree of pulmonic stenosis found at catheterization was quantified as severe in 8 cases (42.11%) with a right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) in excess of 90 mmHg, and moderate in 11 cases (57.89%) with an RVSP from 70 to 90 mmHg. Transvalvular gradients were registered between 38 and 110 mmHg (m: 69 mmHg and SD: 15 mmHg). According to catheterization data obtained at the time of valvuloplasty, the procedure was considered ineffective in 2 cases (10.52%), scarcely effective in four (21.05%), and successful in the remaining 13 cases (68.42%). Doppler follow-up was carried out between 1.6 and 31.9 months after valvuloplasty (mean 12.9 months and SD: 10 months). Residual stenoses were estimated by Doppler as mild in 13 cases (68.42%), moderate in four (21.05%) and severe in two (10.52%). Mild pulmonary regurgitation was detected in 10 patients (52%). The 13 patients with a satisfactory result had slight residual gradients at the valvular level that had not been modified with the course of time. Of the 4 cases with a poorly effective dilatation the gradients noted by Doppler increased in three of them, being valvular in all but one in whom the obstruction was catalogued as infundibular.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
