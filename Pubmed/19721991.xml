<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Evaluating the impact of educational intervention concerning knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) aimed at changing behaviour in how pesticides and organophosphates are applied in a sample of potato farmers from seven municipalities in the Boyacá department of Colombia in connection with occupational health and labour risks. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a nested, before-after, intervention study. A participative strategy-based occupational health and labour risk educational intervention was used with 659 potato farmers. Knowledge, attitudes and practice concerning these matters were evaluated prior to and following the intervention. RESULTS Statistically significant changes in knowledge were recorded; lesser significance was recorded regarding attitudes and practices. DISCUSSION Educational interventions in vulnerable, low scholastic level populations require ongoing accompaniment and support for achieving significant changes in health practice.</dc:description>
