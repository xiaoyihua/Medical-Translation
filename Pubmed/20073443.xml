<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the behaviour of mortality due to ischemic cardiopathy in Mexico during the years 2000 through 2007. METHODS The codes of the International Classification of Diseases 10 that correspond to the ischemic cardiopathy were identified. The rates of mortality nationwide, by federative entity, and by socioeconomic region as well as by degree of education, type of job, and public health services entitlement, were determined. Likewise, the strength of association by means of the regression of Poisson among federative entities, socioeconomic regions where individuals resided in, and mortality by ischemic cardiopathy were also determinated. RESULTS Of the studied population (397,934), the majority were retirees and pensioners 230,976 (58 %), had incomplete elementary education 167945 (42.2 %), and were not entitled to a public health institution 152787 (38.4 %). The federative entities and the socioeconomic region with the highest strength of association between mortality and ischemic cardiopathy were Chihuahua 2000 (RR = 2.6, CI 95 % = 2.4 - 2.8), 2007 (RR = 1.9, CI 95 % = 1.8 -2) and Region 7, 2000 (RR 2.6, CI 95 % = 2.5 - 2.7), 2007 (RR 2.3, CI 95 % = 95 % 2.2 - 2.4), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The mortality was higher among males. The majority were retirees and pensioners, had incomplete elementary school, and were not entitled to any public health institution. The entity and region that presented the highest strength of association between mortality and isquemic cardiopathy were Chihuahua and region 7.</dc:description>
