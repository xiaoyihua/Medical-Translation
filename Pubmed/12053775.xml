<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the incidence trends of hepatic tumors among children living in Mexico City. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional hospital survey was conducted to yield two databases. The first database contains the registry of all the cases of hepatic tumors occurring during the period 1982-1991, in public hospitals of Mexico City. The second database contains all hepatic tumor cases found between 1996 and 1999 in Hospital de Pediatría del Centro Médico Nacional "Siglo XXI" and in Hospital General del Centro Médico La Raza, both hospitals pertaining to Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Institute of Social Security). The average annual incidence rates (AAIR) were calculated for each type of hepatic tumor. The rates were standardized with the direct method, using as standard the world population under 15 years of age. The trends were evaluated with the annual incidence rates and the average rate of change assuming a Poisson distribution. RESULTS The AAIR for hepatoblastoma during the period 1982-1991 was three times higher for men than for women, with a value of 0.6 x 10(6). The group of 1-4 years of age was the most affected. For hepatocarcinomas the AAIR was two-fold for women (0.14) as compared to men. Between 1996-1999 the AAIR for hepatoblastoma was 5.11 in women and 1.85 in men. The age group with the highest rate was women under one year of age. The AAIR for hepatocarcinoma was 0.64 for males and 1.23 for females. The most affected age group was males aged 10 to 14 years. No significant upward or downward trend was found in the incidence of hepatoblastomas. A non-significant change rate of 10% was found for hepatocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS No significant trends were observed in the incidence of hepatic tumors in children of Mexico City aged under 15 years, during the periods 1982-1991 and 1996-1999.
