<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND/AIM Pneumonectomy is seldom indicated in children and its long-term effects are not well known. The aim of the present study was to examine retrospectively the indications and the long-term sequelae in a relatively large cohort of patients treated at our institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS We reviewed the charts of children undergoing pneumonectomy between 1969 and 2009 with particular attention to indications, techniques, complications, survival, pulmonary function and spine deformities RESULTS Ten patients (M:F=6/4) aged 102 +/- 66 months underwent pneumonectomy for bronchiectasis (4, one with cystic fibrosis), tumors (4, 1 myofibroblastic inflammatory pseudotumor, 1 bronchial carcinoid, 1 primary pulmonary PNET and 1 massive metastasis of osteosarcoma) and malformations (2, 1 pulmonary sequestration and 1 congenital bilobar emphysema). Overall survival was 90% at 5.6 (0.3-23) years. Patients with bronchiectasis improved markedly except the one with cystic fibrosis who died. All children with tumors cured. Four have some degree of scoliosis which is severe in one with malformative costal fusion. All survivors live unrestristricted normal lives. Postoperative respiratory function is well preserved with FVC of 58% (40-70%), FEV1 of 60% (47-84%) and FEV1/FVC of 92% (87-98%) of the theoretical value for their height and weight. CONCLUSIONS Pneumonectomy does not affect by itself to the overall survival, and the respiratory function is good and there is no impairment of the quality of life.</dc:description>
