<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Thyroid dysfunction is common among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It presents in different forms and has a multifactorial etiology. AIM To determine the prevalence and features of thyroid dysfunction among patients infected with HIV. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study of 127 patients infected with HIV aged 19 to 75 years (85% males). Patients with previous diagnoses of endocrine diseases and pregnant women were excluded. Participants responded a questionnaire about symptoms and the evolution of HIV infection. A blood sample was obtained to measure thyroid stimulating hormone, free thyroxin, viral load and CD4 count. RESULTS Hypothyroidism was found 13 cases, hyperthyroidism in one case and hypothyroxinemia in eight cases. No difference in symptoms was found between patients with or without thyroid dysfunction. No significant differences were observed in CD4 count or the prevalence of co-infection with Hepatitis B virus among patients with thyroid dysfunction. No association between antiretroviral agents and thyroid dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSIONS The thyroid abnormalities found in this group of HIV infected patients were usually asymptomatic. It may be advisable to systematically assess thyroid function in HIV infected patients.</dc:description>
