<dc:description xml:lang="en">Melorheostosis is a rare benign sclerosing bone dysplasia. Its etiology is unknown. Both sexes can be affected. Sites most frequently involved are the long bones of the lower limbs and the adjacent soft tissue structures. The disease is unusual in the upper limbs, and few cases have been reported in the hand. We report the case of a 7-year-old girl who had typical features of melorheostosis in the right hand. Diagnosis was made by conventional radiography and bone scintigraphy. Magnetic resonance contributed to the assessment of soft tissue lesions. Medical treatment allowed pain relief and range of motion improvement. Because melorheostosis has a variable tendency towards progression and association with tumors, a close follow-up of these patients is recommended.</dc:description>
