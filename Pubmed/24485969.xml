<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Exacerbations are a clinical characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of the study was to estimate the resource use and costs associated with COPD exacerbations PATIENTS AND METHODS Observational study performed by retrospective review of patient clinical charts of a Hospital and 6 associated Primary Care Centers. COPD patients &gt;40years old who were followed-up during 2010-2011, and who fulfilled inclusion/exclusion criteria were included in the study. Healthcare resource use and costs associated to COPD exacerbations (moderate/severe) were estimated. Healthcare resource use, loss of productivity and costs associated to the follow-up of COPD patients (with/without exacerbations) were also estimated. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS regression model and ANCOVA, P&lt;.05. RESULTS A total of 1,210patients were included in the study, of whom 51.2% experienced an exacerbation, and with an average of 4exacerbations/patient. Presence of exacerbations was associated with age, COPD severity, presence of comorbidities, and time from diagnosis. The average healthcare cost of an exacerbation was €481 (moderate: €375; severe: €863). Patients who experienced an exacerbation had a higher resource use and costs (P&lt;.001). Thus, the follow-up cost of patients without exacerbations was €1,392 versus €3,175 for patients with exacerbations. CONCLUSION The presence of exacerbations in COPD patients was associated with an increase in resource use and associated costs.</dc:description>
