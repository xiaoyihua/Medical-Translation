<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The objective of this research is to identify nursing diagnosis NANDA which is predominant within the immigrant community, linked to the migratory process and part of the framework of the Outcome Present State Test (OPT) of Pesut and Herman's critical awareness. METHODOLOGY Keeping in mind the objectives of this research, this approaches the quality-based paradigm and follows the proposals of phenomenology research. The study was carried out using an individual semi-structured interview of 30 immigrants. A categorization of the data has been applied in accordance with the domains of NANDA for the identification of nursing diagnosis and its analysis has been carried with computer support with Atlas-ti 6.0. RESULTS Twenty three diagnoses were identified in nine out of thirteen taxonomy NANDA domains. Analysis of their interrelationships according to the OPT model were carried out and a clinical reasoning net was created. The main diagnoses achieved in our study was: Readiness for Enhanced Coping. CONCLUSIONS NANDA taxonomy doesn't include the migratory process in the characteristics and related factors of this nursing diagnosis. We consider that nursing taxonomy should be reassessed in order to describe more in depth the specific responses derived from the migratory experience so it can lead to a high quality health care.</dc:description>
