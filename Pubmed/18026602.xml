<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Determining the oral health status (dental decay and gingivitis) of adolescents from Mexico City and affection pattern by tooth type and treatment needs. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was designed for 590 adolescents aged 13 to 16 from an urban area of Mexico City. Oral exploration formed part of the health diagnosis provided by the Schools Promoting Health Programme. The DMFT (decayed, missing and filled teeth) index was used for determining dental decay. Diagnosis with no probe was used for evaluating gingivitis. Chi2 tests were applied and risks were calculated for evaluating the association between dental decay, gingivitis and affection pattern by tooth type according to sex and age. RESULTS The prevalence of dental decay and gingivitis was 92,2 % and 13,7 %, respectively. DMFT index was 7,3. Being aged 14 and over represented a significant risk for dental decay (OR=3,1; CI95 %=1,5-6,4). The treatment needs index for dental decay was 95,7 %, representing an expenditure of 642 450 Mexican pesos (59 818,4 US dollars). DISCUSSION Regarding adolescents' oral health status, dental caries was the affection having the highest prevalence and its risk increased with age. The DMFT index was twice as high as WHO standards.</dc:description>
