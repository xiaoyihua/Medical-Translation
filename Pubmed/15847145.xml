<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To establish a correlation between intrafollicular superoxide dismutase enzyme concentrations, activity with oestradiol levels, and the effects on oocyte quality and maturity. STUDY Prospective, descriptive and observational. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-one patients underwent IVF-ET program. The ovarian stimulation protocol was made with recombinant FSH and GnRH antagonists. All follicles were aspirated one by one, and the follicular fluid was stored at a -20 degrees C room temperature. We retrieved 120 follicular fluids and performed the measurement of oestradiol and superoxide dismutase enzyme on each follicular fluid and its correlation with fertilization and cleavage rates. Statistical analysis was carried out with ANOVA, t Student, chi2 and P Pearson tests. RESULTS Patients' mean age was of 33.74 +/- 5.04 years, the mean of enzyme activity was of 76.89%, and the mean concentration of superoxide dismutase enzyme was of 68.71 UI/L. According to oocyte quality or maturity, no statistical differences were observed when comparing oestradiol levels with superoxide dismutase enzyme concentrations. But when we analized both variables, we observed a positive correlation in metaphase 2 oocytes (p = 0.236). When we correlated the superoxide dismutase enzyme activity with oestradiol concentrations in relation to oocyte quality, a positive correlation in good quality oocytes was observed too (p = 0.218). We perceived a strong correlation between SOD concentrations and oestradiol intrafollicular measurements in good quality oocytes. COMMENTS Oocyte maturity and development are conditionated by a close relationship between SOD and intrafollicular oestradiol.</dc:description>
