<dc:description xml:lang="en">Behavioral effects of monocularity were assessed in rats, by means of visual discrimination training in a jumping box. The results showed that the experimental subjects did not differ from controls in brightness discrimination, however, were significantly inferior on a conditional discrimination task. This particular test involves the association of present cues with previously learned ones. Since previous work proposes the consideration of the rat's brain as a functional split-brain, and in our condition the visual information was highly lateralized only to the contralateral hemisphere, we suggest that our results may be due to an impairment produced by the reduction of the brain mass available for the discrimination.</dc:description>
