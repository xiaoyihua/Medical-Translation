<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To study the interrelationship between serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum Interleukin-6 soluble Receptor (IL-6 sR), C-Reactive Protein (C-RP), plasmatic Zinc levels (PlZn) and their response in relation to Zn administered by TPN, in critical patients. METHODS 17 patients, receiving TPN as a consequence of acute pancreatitis (n = 4) or after a major abdominal surgery due to intestinal cancer (n = 7), intestinal fístula (n = 3), intestinal obstruction (n = 2) or intestinal íleus (n = 1) were studied. At the beginning (To) and at the end of the TPN administration (6-21 days) serum IL-6 and IL-6 sR were determined by ELISA; C-RP ultrasensitive (C-RP us) by inmunoturbidimetric method; Zn was determined in TPN and in plasma by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Characteristics of the patients were (mean +/- SD and ranges): age: 60.6 +/- 11.7 (37-77) years; BMI (kg/m(2)): 26.0 +/- 3.4 (19.9-34.0). RESULTS The results (mean +/- standard deviation and ranges) were: Zn provided by TPN (mg/d): 6.1 +/- 2.0 (range 2.8 to 10.8). Biochemical levels were, at To and Tf, respectively: (mean+/-SD and ranges) were at To y Tf, respectively: Zn Pl (microg/dl): 104 +/- 46 (35-177); 120 +/- 55 (52-229); IL-6 (pg/mL) 93 +/- 74 (10-262); 117 +/- 180 (7-761); IL6sR (pg/mL): 1,012 +/- 322 (589-1855); 1,269 +/- 451 (631-2195); C-RP us (mg/L): 71 +/- 63 (2-196); 65 +/- 43 (0-137). There was no correlation between variations of IL6, IL6sR, C-RP, PlZn levels and the daily amount of Zn administered in the TPN mixtures. Two patients presented a bad evolution; they received 4.2 and 5.2 md/d of Zn and showed an increase of IL6 levels, maintained high levels of IL6sR but C-RP levels decreased. CONCLUSIONS the range of 2.8 to 10.8 mg/d of Zn administered in TPN mixtures did not exacerbate the inflammatory response.</dc:description>
