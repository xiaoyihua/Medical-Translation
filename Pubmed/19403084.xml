<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this paper is to analyze the prevalence of mobbing in the workplace, as well as the main associated characteristics, in a multi-occupational sample of 2861 workers from diverse work sectors. For this purpose, a specific mobbing instrument, the "Negative Acts Questionnaire--Revised" (NAQ-R) and a questionnaire elaborated ad hoc about sociodemographic and work aspects considered of interest in this study were employed. The results of this study provide psychometric support for the use of the Spanish version of the NAQ-R as a reliable and valid instrument to assess diverse levels of workplace bullying. The results of the study indicate that 14% of the participants had suffered mobbing behaviors during the past six months. Likewise, the mobbing characteristics found were, in general, similar to those found in diverse studies, both at national and international levels.</dc:description>
