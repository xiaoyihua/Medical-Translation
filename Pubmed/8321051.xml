<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The recent introduction of new antimicrobials allows important changes in the controversial field of their prescription. Longitudinal analysis of the quality and tendencies of the use of antibiotics constitutes one of the basic tools for adapting antibiotic policy. METHODS This study was undertaken in a university hospital with antibiotic policy plans and institutional protocols of antibiotic prophylaxis. The use of antimicrobials with prophylactic and therapeutic aims has been analyzed by 12 prevalence studies over 6 years in a sample equivalent to 10.2% of the population admitted. A comparison between the first three counts (1986-1987) and the last three (1990-1991) was performed. RESULTS A mean of 26.6% of the patients admitted used antibiotics. Nonetheless, while its use as treatment grew with progressive deterioration in the quality of use, its use for prophylaxis decreased and improved. Parallel, the use of restricted antibiotics grew from 12 to 19%. The comparison of the habits of prescription between the onset and the end of the study showed the following important changes: decrease in the use of aminopenicillins and cotrimoxazole and increase in the use of first and third generation cephalosporins, antifungal drugs, tobramycin, vancomycin, the group of urinary antiseptics and quinolones and the miscellaneous group of antimicrobials of minor use. CONCLUSIONS Antibiotics for therapy have been used more and worse, despite the restrictive barriers. The control methods have been effective in prophylaxis with the exception of its excessive prolongation which remains the principal problem. Changes have been registered in the pattern of use of antibiotics in favor of new more effective drugs against multiresistant flora.</dc:description>
