<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Osteomuscular hydatidosis is an uncommon disease in which the spine is involved in 50% of the cases. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult in our setting because of its low incidence and the absence of specific radiological criteria. CLINICAL CASE We present the case of a 72 year-old woman who consulted for slowly progressive paraparesia and was diagnosed, using CT and MR, as having a vertebral lesion of T3. The patient was operated on and many vesicular lesions of hydatidosis were removed surgically. CONCLUSION We review the different forms of presentation of spinal hydatid cysts and the possible therapeutic options.</dc:description>
