<dc:description xml:lang="en">Resistant arterial hypertension is uncommon when there is good compliance to antihypertensive therapy and secondary causes have been ruled out. We report a 41 years old male that suffered hypertensive encephalopathy and received prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy showing progressive raise of arterial pressure levels. Renovascular hypertension, aldosteronism and pheochromocytoma were discarded and, in spite of combined use of antihypertensive drugs, he did not achieve normal blood pressure. When phenytoin was discontinued, blood pressure temporarily normalized. Carbamazepine was started and blood pressure raised again. It fell when this medication was discontinued. Antiepileptic agents could induce drug metabolizing system and thus reduce the effects of antihypertensive medications.</dc:description>
