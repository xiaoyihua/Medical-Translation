<dc:description xml:lang="en">Within the hospital setting, food, nutrition, and the composition of the diets, acquires special relevance, given the particular physiopathological characteristics of the recipients thereof. We intended to know the composition and adequacy of the diets, as well as determining the degree of utility given to the facilities used. This is a transversal study of a week's duration, on the diets of the basic menu of the Alto Deba Hospital, by means of a random selection of 20% of the daily occupancy of each floor (N = 140), marking the trays and weighing the respective remains. The economic calculation was conducted by direct and indirect cost evaluation. The theoretical caloric supply (2372-3375 kcal/day) turns out to be excessive, with it being adequate in proteins (11.5-14.5%), deficient in carbohydrates (33.3-44%), and excessive in fats (42.4-53.4%). 19.3% fo the patients made changes between the two free choice diets of the menu with there being a high acceptance of the vegetables, as well as a high index of remains of those foods rich in bony residues, such a chicken, rabbit, or trout. The choice of deserts is balanced. On the whole, excepting breakfast and mid-afternoon snacks, there is a high percentage of remains (33.7%). We deem neccessary to have the knowledge of personnel qualified in hospital food services, to make, control and adapt the diets to the needs and tastes of the patients, as well as to achieve efficient food services.</dc:description>
