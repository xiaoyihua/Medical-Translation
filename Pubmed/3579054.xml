<dc:description xml:lang="en">24 patients with diagnosed aortic stenosis are reported. Clinical symptoms started before 6 months of age (between 24 hours and 6 months, average 87 days). In all cases aortic stenosis was the only existing malformation, except in one patient who had a small muscular ventricular septal defect and in another case who had a patent ductus arteriosus. Clinical symptoms were early and notable. In nineteen there was congestive heart failure whose appearance in the first week of like was a bad prognosis. Relationship between severity of aortic stenosis and electrocardiographic findings was closer than in older patients. Death rate was very high in children who had not been operated (5 out of 12). Of children who received surgery only one died out of 12. Treatment, therefore, in this pathology must be aggressive.</dc:description>
