<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Stroke is the most frequent cause of epilepsy in adults, specially in those over 60 years old. Our aim was to analyze the etiologic relevance of stroke among the different etiologies of late onset seizures and to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the subgroup of patients with late onset seizures associated to stroke. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients aged over 20 who were admitted to the Neurology or Neurosurgery departments in our hospital for a first-ever seizure over a period of five years were identified retrospectively. The total number of patients included was 248. RESULTS The most frequent etiologies were stroke (26.2%), tumors (26.2%), unknown (24.6%) and chronic alcohol intake (18.5%). Stroke was the most frequent etiology in patients over 60 (50%). Five of the 65 patients with stroke related seizures had suffered an intracranial hemorrhage and the rest had ischemic lesions. Seven patients had clinically silent infarctions. Seizures were generalized in 60% of the cases. Nearly in all the patients lesions were placed close to the cortex and mainly in carotid artery territory. CONCLUSIONS Late onset seizures are due to a lesion in the brain in an important number of cases. Stroke is the most prevalent cause and this prevalence increases with age. A complete diagnostic procedures is warranted in this patients.</dc:description>
