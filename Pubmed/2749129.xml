<dc:description xml:lang="en">One hundred eighty one asthmatic patients were evaluated at the Allergy Consultation in Hermanos Ameijeiras Clinical Surgical Hospital. A case history was made for each of the patients, where the family background and personal history of allergy was collected; possible precipitating factors (such as inhalable, food, infectious, irritant, as well as climate factors) and physical and respiratory examinations. Serum immunoglobulin tests (by means of the ultramicroanalitic system (SUMA) and the rest of Igs: IgA, IgG, IgM by means of Mancini's simple radial immunodifusion method were made. Total eosinophil count was made to all of the patients in the study as well as serial studies of the faces. An increase in the IgE and IgM figures was found in asthmatic patients related to individual controls, and in relation to the normal figures for the adult population in our country. IgA and IgG determinations were normal both in the asthmatic and control groups, related to the standard figures.</dc:description>
