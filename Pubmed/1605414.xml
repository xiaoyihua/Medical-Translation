<dc:description xml:lang="en">A seroepidemiological study, including a interview-questionnaire, was carried out in a representative sample of children from Salamanca (Spain) between the ages of 15 months and 7 years. The objective of this study was to know the vaccination level and the immune status against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). The vaccination level with MMR-vaccine was 70%. The antibody prevalence was 84% against measles, 85.3%, against mumps and 76.7% against rubella. The number of children with antibodies against all three diseases was 66%. Nineteen percent of the children vaccinated with MMR-vaccine were susceptible to one or more of the three diseases. The administration of a second dose of MMR-vaccine may be considered necessary.</dc:description>
