<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of the study is to carry out a clinico-epidemiological study of the part of Barcelona's population over the age of 65 that suffers from cognitive deterioration, users of 'Casal d'Avis' (Old-folks centres). 369 users of 'Casals d'Avis' were studied. A specific questionnaire was used to collect the following data: personal details, social and family situation, health profile and a quantification of their degree of cognitive degeneration using Lobo's cognitive test. The quantitative and qualitative variables were studied statistically, and the arithmetical average and standard deviation were found, as well as which bivariant hypothesis tests and multivariant analyses, using the logistic regression method, were carried out. The degree of cognitive deterioration is 8.67%. Age, female sex, being widowed or single, and illiteracy are associated with low scoring in the MEC. It is also associated with subjective loss of memory and hearing difficulties. The multivariant analyses are influenced by length of schooling, age and sex. Early detection of cognitive deterioration and the supply of resources and services oriented towards cognitive stimulation and social integration would, if well-planned, do away with the need for their confinement.</dc:description>
