<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Intramuscular myxoma is a rare benign soft tissue tumour of mesenchymal origin, which appears as a painless mass of slow growth. Early diagnosis is important in order to differentiate it from other entities, especially soft tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL CASES Two cases, both women with a mean age of 52.5 years (range 40-65) are presented. The first was seen due to growth of a gluteal mass, and the second by coccydynia. Computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance were the diagnostic tests of choice. In one case, where there was a single but large lesion, radical extirpation of the gluteal muscle was chosen. In the other case, in which the lesions were multiple, individualised excision of cysts was performed. Postoperative functional limitation was low in both types of surgery, with good oncological results being obtained. CONCLUSION Intramuscular myxomas are benign lesions. There are no cases of malignancy or recurrence due to incomplete resection. It has to be determined whether they are single or multiple, since in the latter case, they could be due to syndromes such as Mazabraud syndrome, which is associated with bone fibrous dysplasia, or Albright syndrome that is also associated with pigmented skin spots.</dc:description>
