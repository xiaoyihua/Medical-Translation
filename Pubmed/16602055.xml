<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Temporal lobe and amygdala are structures that participate in emotional processing. The purpose of this study was to determine the differential effect of left (LTL) and right (RTL) temporal lobectomy on emotional recognition and experience as well as mood in treatment resistant epileptics who were evaluated pre and post-surgically. PATIENTS AND METHODS Five temporal lobe epileptic patients participated in the study (two from the right and three from the left hemisphere) who were evaluated before and after three months of the surgery. Emotional and prosodic recognition were evaluated, inside and outside of a social context, with and without time limit. Besides, subjective emotional experience while seeing movie fragments was evaluated as well as positive and negative emotional states, anxiety and depression. RESULTS After the surgery, patients with RTL had lower number of correct responses in fear facial and prosodic recognition, while patients with LTL did not show deterioration or they even improved. There were not differences as a function of the intervened hemisphere neither in the intensity of emotions perceived in the scenes, nor in the emotional experience, however, both groups experienced a decrease of negative emotions and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that RTL had a greater effect on emotional recognition outside of a context and with limited time than LTL, while in the emotional experience there were not differences between groups. Lobectomy induced an improvement on affective states.</dc:description>
