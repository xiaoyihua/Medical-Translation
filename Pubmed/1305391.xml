<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thirty very low birth weight newborns (less than 1,500 g) were evaluated at term from the neurological point of view, and were followed-up during the first 2 years of life by a multidisciplinary team, in order to detect long term sequelaes. There were 3 patients with major neurological disorders, and one third presented minor alterations. Neurological evaluation at term was a good sequelae predictor. No significative differences were found in perinatal variables: birthweight, gestational age, Apgar's score, ventilotherapy and with presence of intraventricular hemorrhage when normal outcome prematures were compared with those with neurological disorders. Blindness or deafness were not detected. It's important to continue the follow-up study up to the school age.</dc:description>
