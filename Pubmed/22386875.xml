<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the satisfaction of patients candidates for bariatric surgery with the performance of a group training program prior to surgery, identifying opportunities for improvement in the program and evaluating participants satisfaction following their implementation. METHOD An "ad hoc" designed survey was used, addressed to assess opinions on different aspects of the program, overall satisfaction and identification of areas for improvement. The survey was administered to two groups of patients: the first after one year of implementation of the program to identify suggestions for improvement, and the second after one year of the implementation of the improvement. A total of 112 patients were assessed, 66 in the first pass of the questionnaire and 46 in the second. Both groups were homogeneous in demographic variables RESULTS The main improvement detected was expert patients in the preparation of the program. After implantation, slight changes in the ratings of the questions were produced, that were not significant. Overall satisfaction rose from 9.5 to 9.74 out of 10. The other proposals for improvement were to improve audiovisuals and to fit the room furniture to the characteristics of the patients. CONCLUSIONS The very high satisfaction levels obtained are usual in studies on hospital satisfaction, our results still being above the studies consulted, as well as in levels of excellence. This prevents statistically significant differences being found. There were no significant differences in the results before and after implementation of improvement. Continuous assessment allows new possibilities for improvement.</dc:description>
