<dc:description xml:lang="en">Oral thyroid preparations, which were first administered in 1892 to treat myxedema, are the oldest effective endocrine medications. Since thyroxin became available, such drugs have been dispensed without a physician's prescription and have come to be mistakenly referred to as "diet pills". Self-prescription of such products can cause changes in thyroid function, with systemic repercussions. We report the case of a woman who took thyroid extracts, among other diet drugs to enhance weight loss without medical supervision. The patient failed to report taking such drugs during the preanesthetic visit. Interrupting therapy several days before surgery produced a state of hypothyroidism that led to marked postoperative hemodynamic changes necessitating transfer to the intensive care unit.</dc:description>
