<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present a retrospective study on 506 patients with acute pancreatitis (AP), admitted in our hospital in the last five years (1984-1988). The goal of the paper is to establish a possible correlation between the severity and the etiology of the AP. Depending on the severity of the acute attack, and according to the Ranson's prognostic signs and the findings of the abdominal CAT, we have classified AP in three grades: mild, moderate and severe. 52% of AP were of biliary etiology, 25.7% alcoholic, and in 17.0% of the cases the responsible agent was not demonstrated. In relation with severity, the distribution was as follows: mild, 184 (36.4%), moderate, 254 (50.2%) and severe, 68 (13.4%). Among the cases of biliary and alcoholic etiology, 14.7% and 9.2%, respectively, were severe. Postoperative AP were severe in 71.4% of the cases. Systemic complications were more frequent in the severe forms, particularly of biliary etiology. Pancreatic abscesses and fistulas were also more frequent in biliary pancreatitis; on the other hand, pseudocysts and ascites were more common in alcoholic pancreatitis. Overall mortality was 2.8% (14 patients). Mortality was 19.1% in the severe forms. In relation to etiology the mortality was as follows: 3.7% in biliary AP; 0.8% in alcoholic AP; 14.3% in postoperative AP; and 2.3% in the idiopathic AP.</dc:description>
