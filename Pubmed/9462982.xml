<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE A prospective study was carried out in order to determine the behaviour of the arterial blood pressure in patients with cerebrovascular disease admitted to our hospital. In this study, 365 case histories were reviewed. MATERIAL AND METHODS There was a higher percentage of previous clinical histories of hypertension, diastolic hypertension, systolic hypertension on admission and labile arterial pressure in patients with hemorrhagic disease. RESULTS Arterial pressure at the time of admission was higher in those patients who had a previous history of hypertension, had a haemorrhagic episode or in those who died. In patients with a past history of hypertension there were higher incidences of hypertension on admission, labile hypertension and death. CONCLUSION It is concluded that changes in arterial blood pressure are frequent in patients with cerebrovascular disease, particularly haemorrhagic disease. This would seem to have a direct effect on the neurological course.</dc:description>
