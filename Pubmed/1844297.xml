<dc:description xml:lang="en">A 25 year old woman developed severe episodes of hypoglycemia during the first weeks of pregnancy. Insulin blood levels of 53 uU/ml and Peptide C levels of 6.5 ng/dl were shown associated to a blood glucose level of 34 mg/dl. Echotomographic examination of the abdomen was unrewarding. Surgical exploration revealed a 1.5 cm tumor located at the junction of the body and tail of the pancreas, which was removed. Hypoglycemia disappeared and pregnancy continued uneventfully ending in a normal delivery at 40 weeks. The newborn was normal and no motor or psychologic abnormalities have been noted during follow up to 2 years of age.</dc:description>
