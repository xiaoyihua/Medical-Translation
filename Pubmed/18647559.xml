<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND We undertook this study to describe three cases of reconstruction of the floor of the mouth with two simultaneous free flaps. METHODS Three patients with cancer of the anterior floor of the mouth were subjected to segmental resection of the mandible and resection of the floor of the mouth with subsequent reconstruction using two simultaneous osseous and fasciocutaneous free flaps. RESULTS All patients had a satisfactory evolution. Two patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy, one due to the initial clinical stage and the other due to positive surgical margins. The third patient had neoadjuvant postoperative radiotherapy and concomitant chemoradiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS If a tumor involves osseous structures of the anterior floor of the mouth, it is best to perform surgery with wide margins with segmental resection of the mandible. Surgical technique is the decision of the surgeon: how many and which types of flaps will be used for reconstruction of the anterior floor of mouth. When there is necrosis of a free flap in the head and neck region, attempt with another free flap is recommended.</dc:description>
