<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Abnormal small bowel motility, observed in liver cirrhosis, can be reversed with cisapride. Since both cisapride and liver disease are associated with prolonged QT interval, the possibility of adverse cardiovascular effects might be expected with cisapride treatment in these patients. AIM To evaluate QT interval and other electrocardiographic changes during long term treatment with cisapride in cirrhotic patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty seven cirrhotic patients were studied. Electrocardiogram was recorded and the QT interval corrected according to Bazzett's formula was determined (normal value &lt; 0.44 s). Seventeen patients were treated with cisapride, 10 mg tid for seven months and electrocardiographic controls were performed at the end of the treatment. RESULTS The mean corrected QT interval was 0.46 +/- 0.03 s (range 0.4-0.53). 34 patients (64%) had QTc prolongation (0.47 +/- 0.02 s). Statistically significant higher values of QTc were observed in patients at Child Pugh stage B and C compared to stage A. No statistically significant difference according to the etiology of liver disease, were observed. No changes in mean QTc duration were observed during cisapride treatment. CONCLUSIONS In spite that a prolonged QTc was a frequent finding in our series of selected patients, no cardiovascular adverse effects were observed with long term cisapride treatment.</dc:description>
