<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The Nesbit technique is the reference technique for the surgical correction of the penile incurvation of Peyronie's disease. We report our experience at the Centro Urológico San Ignacio. METHODS 68 patients with stable penile incurvation who requested surgical correction. Correction of the curvature is defined as &gt; or = 80% rectification of the pathologic angle. Mean patient age was 44 years (31-77). 53% of the patients presented difficulties for penetration, 20% partner's discomfort on intercourse, and 27% requested surgery for aesthetic reasons. Penile deviation was dorsal in 42% of the patients, to the left in 46% and to the right in 12%. The curvature angle was less than 30 degrees in 28%, between 30 degrees-45 degrees in 36%, between 45 degrees-60 degrees in 37% and &gt; 60 degrees in 7%. RESULTS Mean follow-up of the series was 36 months. 20% of the patients had a penile shortening longer than 1.5 cm. 85% of the patients are satisfied with the results. The most frequent complaint was penile shortening. Correction was achieved in 92% of the patients. Four patients were reoperated: two of them for significant phimosis three months after surgery, and the other two for curvature recurrence. CONCLUSIONS The Nesbit technique is a simple technique, with a low complication rate, and good results both in curvature correction and patient satisfaction.</dc:description>
