<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Surfactant delivered using a minimally invasive technique, known as MIST (Minimally Invasive Surfactant Therapy) is a method which allows surfactant to be administered to a patient connected to non-invasive respiratory support. This is an increasingly used therapy in Neonatal Units that reduces the intubation rate and the pathology associated with intubation and allows the surfactant to be administered to the patients who clinically need it. PATIENTS AND METHODS In years 2013 and 2014 in the Hospital General Universitario de Elche surfactant was delivered using this method to 19 patients, five of whom were 28 or less weeks of gestation age at birth. A comparison is made with a historical cohort consisting of 28 patients with Respiratory Distress Syndrome treated initially with non-invasive respiratory support. RESULTS No incidents were recorded that caused the interruption of the administration. A reduction in the fraction of inspired oxygen was observed in all cases after surfactant administration. Fewer intubations in the first 72 hours of life were found in the treatment group compared to the control group (42% vs. 54%). DISCUSSION The experience recorded in the Hospital General Universitario de Elche shows that the administration of surfactant using a MIST technique is a reproducible method of treatment, which allows the surfactant distribution during spontaneous breathing with non invasive respiratory support.</dc:description>
