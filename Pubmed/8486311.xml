<dc:description xml:lang="en">Screening of donor blood for hepatitis B led to recognition that most cases of post-transfusion hepatitis were due to an agent known as non-A, non-B. Until recently the causative agent for non-A, non-B hepatitis was identified, being denominated hepatitis C virus. It is estimated that one-half of patient with hepatitis C develop chronic liver disease, and 20% of this will develop cirrhosis. We describe a patient who due to obstetric complications received blood transfusion and during puerperium developed an icteric syndrome which was identified as C hepatitis. We review the diagnostic methodology, clinical characteristics, evolution and preventive measures of the C hepatitis.</dc:description>
