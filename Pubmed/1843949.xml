<dc:description xml:lang="en">Non-ulcer dyspepsia is a frequent clinical entity characterized by chronic upper gastrointestinal symptoms without organic lesions by radiology, sonography or endoscopy. We studied simultaneously the rate of gastric emptying and gallbladder contraction in 10 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia and in 10 healthy controls after ingestion of 500 cc of isotonic saline, and 500 cc of a liquid mixed meal, hypercaloric and hyperosmotic. The measurements were done by direct real-time ultrasonic imaging in fasting and were repeated at regular intervals (15-30 minutes) after the liquid meal, until complete gastric emptying was established. We found with the liquid mixed meal, the patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia had a significant delay in gastric emptying and gallbladder hypokinesis with faulty contraction and slow refilling. Dynamic ultrasonographic studies are useful in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia.</dc:description>
