<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy involves foot deformities such as varus and cavus foot and claw toes. Several surgical techniques have been described to treat Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical and functional result of "V" basal osteotomy of the central metatarsals with elevation of the first metatarsal, dorsal osteotomy plus closing osteotomy, and elevation of the fifth metatarsal in Charcot-Marie-Tooth patients during a five-year period. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective, randomized, longitudinal, observational and descriptive study conducted during a five-year period. Twenty-four patients met the inclusion criteria: 16 males and 8 females. Seven underwent the surgical procedure in the right foot, seven in the left, and 10 in both feet, for a total of 34 feet treated. Results: The Pearson correlation coefficient was -0.1 and T = 1.71. A statistically significant difference was seen between the variables, which meant that, in the six-month follow-up, surgical treatment had representative benefits. CONCLUSIONS The study found a statistically significant value for function, pain and alignment in patients who underwent surgical treatment, compared with their status prior to surgery. It is therefore recommended to continue using this technique in all patients presenting with anterior cavus foot.</dc:description>
