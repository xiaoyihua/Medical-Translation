<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Prevalence of late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) both familial and sporadic is increasing with the raising proportion of third-age population. There are evidences either supporting or rejecting the existence of differences in the behavior of neuropsychological variables between familial and sporadic cases of LOAD. OBJECTIVE To identify neuropsychological variables discriminating between familial and sporadic cases of LOAD, in order to detect clinical manifestations that may provide information on the pathological process of the neurodegenerative process. PATIENTS AND METHODS Using sequential sampling, we selected individuals affected by LOAD according to the criteria of the DSM-IV and NINCS-ADRDA. The following neuropsychological protocol was used: CERAD, Wisconsin, Phonological Fluency, Rey's Figure, Raven, A Cancellation Test, WAIS (Arithmetic); also used were: Global Deterioration Scale, Functional Assessment Staging of Reisberg (FAST), Barthel and Yesavage. Parametrical and non-parametrical univariate, factorial (principal components) and discriminant analyses were performed. In total, 52 patients were analyzed (average age: 74.8 years; mean age at onset of the disease: 69 years; time of disease's evolution: 5.7 years; average of educational level: 6.4 years). RESULTS No significant statistical differences were found in clinical or neuropsychological variables between familial and sporadic cases of LOAD. Additionally, neither variables nor models were detected discriminating significantly between them. CONCLUSION Familial and sporadic cases of LOAD present the same clinical and neuropsychological phenotype which makes very probable that sporadic cases are low penetrance familial ones.</dc:description>
