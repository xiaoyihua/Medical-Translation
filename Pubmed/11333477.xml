<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To describe statural growth in a sample of both sexes using the Preece-Baines model 1 (PB1) in order to obtain smoothed percentiles for use in reference growth charts. To apply the PB1to several historical samples, with different age ranges, obtained from the literature (1896-1983) in order to study secular changes in stature. MATERIAL AND METHODS The sample consisted of 1,525 schoolchildren, aged 6-18 years. The PB1was fitted to the percentile curves, which were corrected for deviation from normal distribution by the LMS model. The PB1was applied to the historical samples and the variables describing growth spurt and adult height were compared. RESULTS The age of peak height velocity (PHV) was 13.73 years in males and 11.02 years in females. Estimated adult height, in this model, was 176.22 cm for males and 163.53 cm for females. Mean velocity of secular change in males was estimated as 1.2 cm/decade. The age at PHV increased by 0.2 years/decade. CONCLUSIONS The PB1did not achieve smoothed percentile curves for use in reference growth charts. Right skewness of the distribution was corrected by application of the LMS method. However, the PB1is useful for studying secular trends in statural growth.</dc:description>
