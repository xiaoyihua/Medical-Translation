<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To report one case of metachronous recurrence of idiopathic high flow priapism. METHODS. We describe the case of a 28-year-old male patient who presents with penile partial tumescence which started 10 hours before and history of a similar episode seven years before. Physical examination confirmed the clinical picture, with mild local discomfort on palpation. Blood tests were normal. Cavernous blood gases were compatible with arterial blood O2 saturation levels. The patient had a satisfactory progressive response to oral administration of diazepam. No pathologic findings were seen at the time of arteriography. RESULTS Complete resolution of the episode. Erectile function was satisfactorily preserved. There was no relapse after one year of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS We remark the validity of a deferred therapeutic attitude in front of pictures of high flow priapism, as well as the possibility of resolution with conservative measures. We emphasize the peculiarities of this case, mainly its idiopathic character and the metachronous recurrence.</dc:description>
