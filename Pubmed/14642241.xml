<dc:description xml:lang="en">Multiple hematological anomalies have been described in association with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of isolated thrombopenia with a normal or increased number of megakaryocytes in bone marrow and absence of splenomegaly. Several case reports of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, mostly ulcerative colitis, have been published in the literature. The pathogenic mechanism through which these entities are associated is unknown. Several treatments have been used, varying from short courses of steroids to the use of immunosuppressive agents and splenectomy, depending on the severity of the symptoms. We describe the case of a woman with ulcerative colitis and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, in which the latter first presented when the patient was undergoing treatment with corticosteroids and cyclosporin, one of the therapeutic options for controlling thrombopenic purpura. Platelet deficiency persisted despite treatment with azathioprine and colectomy, also described as a possible curative treatment.</dc:description>
