<dc:description xml:lang="en">Postintubation tracheal stenosis is a very important clinical situation. It is estimated to occur in approximately 5% to 20% of intubated or tracheostomized patients. However, 1% also suffers severe respiratory dysfunction. We report the case of a 45-year old patient who required surgery under general anesthesia (first intubation experience) after suffering severe coronary disease. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, connected to maintained mechanical ventilation for 9 days when he was weaned and extubated. He then suffered a picture of respiratory failure requiring reintubation (for a second time) and reconnection to the mechanical ventilator. He evolved favorably, and it was possible to wean him again with final extubation on the 12th day. At 28 days, he presented a picture of dyspnea, stridor, tachypnea and a bronchoscope examination show tracheal stenosis in the subglotic region. He was treated with laser and silicone tracheal stent, with good evolution.</dc:description>
