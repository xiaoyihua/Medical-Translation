<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF) generates a hypercoagulable state with an increased thrombin generation and raised levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes, which results in a high risk of stroke and thromboembolism. AIM To evaluate the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban by anti-Xa factor activity and its correlation with thrombin-antithrombin complexes, thrombin generation and prothrombin time in patients newly diagnosed with non-valvular AF. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospective study in patients with indication of anticoagulation. Demographic variables, cardiovascular risk factors, CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores were recorded. Blood samples were taken at baseline, at 3 and 24 hours after the administration of the drug and at 30 days. Rivaroxaban levels, anti-Xa activity, prothrombin time, thrombin generation and plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes were determined. RESULTS We studied 20 patients aged 76.3 ± 8.0 years (60% female) with a CHA2DS2-VASc score &gt; 2 points. The anti-Xa factor activity correlated with rivaroxaban plasma levels at 3 hours (r = 0.61, p &lt; 0.01), at 24 hours (r = 0.85, p &lt; 0.01) and at 30 days (r = 0.99, p &lt; 0.01), with prothrombin time at 3 hours (r = -0.86, p = 0.019) and at 30 days (r = -0.63, p = 0.02) and with a sustained decrease in thrombin generation at 30 days of follow-up (r = -0.74, p &lt; 0.01). There was no correlation with thrombin-antithrombin complexes (r = -0.02, p = 0.83). CONCLUSIONS Rivaroxaban consistently inhibited the mild pro-coagulant state found in newly diagnosed non-valvular AF patients through the first 24 hours and this effect was maintained at 30 days. Plasma levels of the drug correlated with anti-Xa factor activity, thrombin generation and prothrombin time.</dc:description>
