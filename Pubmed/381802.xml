<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since Zollinger and Ellison described two cases of this disease in 1955 which would later recieve their names (ZED), more than 1,000 cases have been published in the world literature up to date. In our area around 28 cases have been reported in a period of 14 years (1964--1976). The author reviews this disease, evaluating and comparing results obtained in this small series, with regard to prevalence, clinical manifestations and histopathologic lesions, against those obtained in series of large scope. Mean age was 46 years, ranging from 18 to 63 years, and the male-female ratio was 7:5. Ulcers and diarrhea were present in 100 percent and in 35 percent of the cases, respectively. The incidence of AEM-1 was 25 percent. In 85 percent of the cases the existence of a gastrinoma was demostrated, being pancreatic in 78 percent and extrapancreatic in 7 percent. In 10 percent of the cases there was a diffuse hyperplasia of the islet cells, and in one case, there was hyperplasia of the G-cells of the antrum. These results are very similar to those obtained by different authors.</dc:description>
