<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In adult patients, the diagnostic process for celiac disease (CD) is often very late and generates health complications that would be avoided by earlier diagnosis. The diseases of wich these patients were diagnosed before setting the diagnosis of CD were many and diverse. In addition, following a gluten-free diet (GFD) leads to a reduction in the quality of life for patients, who find it difficult to travel, to find accredited restaurants with menus without gluten, to interpretate food labels or to go to friends' houses. OBJECTIVE To determine the delay in diagnosis, the satisfaction of the information provided by different sources and circumstances related to the quality of life. METHOD A retrospective cross-sectional observational study in 98 adult celiac through a validated questionnaire for celiac patientes. RESULTS The average delay in diagnosis was 11 years and the average of doctors consulted prior to confirmation of the CD was 6. Osteoporosis or osteopenia were nearly twice as common among those who took more than five years to be diagnosed. Some 90% say they transgress the dietary pattern, however, 58% show clinical symptoms due to unnoticed consumption of gluten. The impact of GFD on the quality of life is very high. CONCLUSIONS Long delays in diagnosis suggest the need for greater awareness among physicians about the EC and the use of serological tests in potential patients or risk groups.</dc:description>
