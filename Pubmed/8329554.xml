<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To study the influence of gender on the immunogenic response to the hepatitis B vaccine in healthy persons. DESIGN Meta-analysis. SETTING Primary care: prevention. PARTICIPANTS The results published between 1983 and 1991 by several authors dealing with staff in Spanish hospitals were reviewed. MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS It was observed that the frequency of women's antibody response differed significantly from that of men (chi-squared = 23.35; p &lt; 0.001) with an odds ratio of 2 (95% confidence intervals: 1.64-2.46) and a risk difference of 7.69% (95% CI: 5.2-10.19%). CONCLUSIONS The response rate to the hepatitis B vaccine is significantly higher among women than men. However, several factors (e.g. age and weight) may affect these findings. These have not been examined because they were not described in the findings of the preliminary studies.</dc:description>
