<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in a pregnant population of Barcelona (Spain). MATERIAL AND METHODS 301 pregnant women controlled in the Hospital Clinic i Provincial (HCP) of Barcelona were enrolled in the study. Complete epidemiological information, and vaginal samples were available in 293 women. BV was diagnosed by Gram stain of vaginal smear (Nugent's criteria). RESULTS BV was detected in 22 pregnant women (7.5%; 95% CI: 4.6-10.5%). There was no association between race, parity, education, marital status, smoking and drug use, and the presence of BV. Non-use of birth control method (72.3% vs 34.4%; p &lt; 0.0001), presence of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) during pregnancy (22.7% vs 3.7%; p &lt; 0.0001), HIV seropositivity (13.6% vs 2.9%; p = 0.041) and presence of symptoms of vaginitis (40.9% vs 13.3%; p = 0.009) were significantly associated with the presence of BV. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of BV in a pregnant population of Barcelona (Spain) is 7.5%. Further work is needed to evaluate the usefulness of BV as a prescreening marker for STD and HIV infection. The Gram stain provides an inexpensive, fast and easy method to diagnose BV, and may allow us to screen, treat and prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with it.</dc:description>
