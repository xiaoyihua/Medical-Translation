<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Anthropometry is an effective method used in the evaluation of the state of nutrition. Anthropometric reference values obtained from the general population have frequently been used. The aim of this study was to determine the anthropometric parameters of the elderly in Manresa and demonstrate the different evolution of these values in both sexes between the ages of 65 and 85 or more. METHODS Following randomization a representative sample of 1,034 healthy elderly subjects living in Manresa was obtained with the following being determined: weight, height, tricipital, subscapular and abdominal fat folds, arm circumference, arm muscle perimeter, weight/height indexes, muscle and fat areas of the arm and percentage of fat. All the measurements were obtained by the same person with the use of a tallimeter scale with a flexible metric tape and a Holtain lipocalibrater. RESULTS The values are presented in percentiles by subgroups of age and sex. The weight, height and indexes of lean mass were greater in males while those determining fatty mass were greater in females. In females all the values decreased between 65 and 85 or more years of age (p &lt; 0.001), while in males all decreased (p &lt; 0.001) except; tricipital and abdominal skin folds. Upon comparison of these parameters with those obtained in other geographic areas, differences were observed between both. CONCLUSIONS By the characteristics of the population studied it was considered that the anthropometric parameters obtained are extensible to all the elderly population of Catalonia and may be used as reference values of the same.</dc:description>
