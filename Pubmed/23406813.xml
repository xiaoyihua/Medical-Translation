<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy is considered to be the technique of choice in the management of stage T1 and T2 renal cancer, through increased expertise in this alternative type of surgery has served to expand its indications. In any case, these procedures have a series of limitations which are tied to the intrinsic characteristics of laparoscopic surgery, and associated with patient and tumor characteristics, and surgeon's expertise. METHODS We performed a bibliographic review through Pub Med database. RESULTS The present study discusses the different indications and establishes the current limits of laparoscopic surgery applied to the management of renal tumors (including T3 and T4). Its role in cell reducing therapy for metastatic disease, and the available methods to reduce tumor implantation in the surgical ports are also commented. CONCLUSIONS Radical laparoscopic surgery is the technique of choice for the treatment of renal tumors in stage T1 and T2. There are not significant differences among the different approaches, and it has lower incision-related morbidity compared to traditional surgery, a shorter period of convalescence and the same oncological efficacy.</dc:description>
