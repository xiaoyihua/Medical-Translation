<dc:description xml:lang="en">Percutaneous esplenoportogammagraphy in 28 patients with portal hypertension, was carried out; in three patients studies were done before and after a derivative operation; in nine only after operation for portal hypertension and thirteen patients were not surgically treated. Hepatic maximal opacification was obtained in 4.35 seconds. In the operated patients the tecnesium reached right cardiac chambers in 2.91 seconds. In three of the thirteen patients with the test, there were intrahepatic circulatory pattern changes, average spleen-liver was 6 seconds and spleen-heart, 7 seconds, that is, esplenoportal perfussion was poor. In all the operated patients the decreased circulation time spleen-heart and the typical image showed anastomosis permeability.</dc:description>
