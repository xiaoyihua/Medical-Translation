<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Using a shortened rating scale, the prevalence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has been reported to be very higher in a Colombian population. However, these data require clinical confirmation. OBJECTIVE To confirm clinically the prevalence of ADHD in Colombian children and adolescents. PATIENTS AND METHODS A randomized sample of 4 to 17 year old children and adolescents--184 males and 157 females--was selected from the schools. Sample was stratified in two socioeconomic status: high (4, 5, 6) and low (1, 2, 3). Several parents' and teachers' rating scales for the diagnosis of ADHD, standardized and validated in the Colombian population, were applied to the sample. The diagnosis of ADHD was confirmed using a semi-structured psychiatric and neurological interview, and medical histories revisions. RESULTS Analysis found that prevalence of ADHD is 17.1%. Distribution for ADHD types was: combined 9.4%, inattentive 6.7% and hyperactive-impulsive 1%. Prevalence for boys was significant higher (21.8%) than for girls (10.9%) (chi 2 = 11.8, p &lt; 0.01). In male predominate combined type and in female inattentive. Higher prevalence was found in low socioeconomic strata. Preschool children have lower prevalence (6.2%) than school 6 to 11 year old children (22.6%) and adolescents (21.6%). CONCLUSION A higher prevalence of ADHD was confirmed in Colombian population.</dc:description>
