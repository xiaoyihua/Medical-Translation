<dc:description xml:lang="en">The morphopathology of tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia is detailed as a spectrum of variations which is the foundation to highlight the surgical anatomy of this cardiopathy and it is the embryological basis which determines its structure. Thirty five hearts were studied with the methodology of the segmental sequential system. The atrial situs, the connections between the cardiac chambers and between the right ventricle and the arterial pulmonary vasculature were determined. The atrial situs was solitus, the concordant atrioventricular connection was the most frequent (33), the ventriculoarterial connections were concordant (17), double outlet right ventricle (9) and single outlet (9). All hearts had atresia of the pulmonary valve; the pulmonary trunk was hypoplastic (20), atretic proximally (6) and completely absent (9), confluent and hypoplastic pulmonary branches (25), absence of confluence (5), complete absence of pulmonary branches and arterial ducts (5) and presence of aortopulmonary collaterals (10). The hearts show a morphopathologic spectrum of severity which documents the tendency in disappearing the connection between the right ventricle and the intrapulmonary arterial circulation. The determination of the arterial supply to the lungs is highlighted to unifocalize the blood flow toward the lungs. The usefulness of Barbero Marcial's surgical classification is emphasized. The embryologic knowledge is basic in understanding the vascular connections between right ventricle and the derivatives of embryonic sixths aortic arches, the intrapulmonary arterial vessels and the aortopulmonary collaterals."</dc:description>
