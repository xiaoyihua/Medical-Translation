<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since 1975, the authors have been working in immunochemotherapy in acute myeloblastic leukemic adult patients. Autologous leukemic leucocytoblasts have been cultured with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (NVC). Thereafter, neoplastic cells were radiated with cobalt bomb and frozen to--70degreesC and afterwards 5 X 10(6) of these leucoblasts were intradermally injected to each patients every eight days. All patients received between six to ten injections. So far, ten such patients have been followed during eight months and since two months after immunization no leukemic leucocytoblasts in bone marrow and blood have been detected. Hemoglobin and platelets have increased more rapidly than usual and no patient has developed side effects. Phagocytosis tests carried out in vitro during remission, have demonstrated that only in immunized patients neutrophils and monocytes were capable of phagocytosis of autologous cultured malignant leucocytoblasts. The nucleus of phagocytized malignant cells was small and basophylic. These so far undescribed phagocytic cells were named post-immunization cells.</dc:description>
