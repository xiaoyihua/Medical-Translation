<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To design a device that integrates a laser photocoagulator in a fundus camera so that the functions of both are incorporated for their simultaneous use. This system would allow the visualizacion of the fundus during photocoagulation, with a no-contact, no hand-helped lens technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS To test the device we used a fundus camera Fx500 (Kowa) and a diode laser Oculight SLx (Iris Medical). We analysed the physical and power laser parameters, performing a comprehensive control of the device's safety. In order to measure the error in the precision of the laser, we designed a micrometric test to evaluate the directionality of the beam and the focusing system. Finally, we test the size, time of exposure and intensity necessary to obtain an effective impact. RESULTS With our system, transpupilar photocoagulation fullfils the main safety requirements on laser radiation and illumination in retinoscopy. After diverse adjustments, the laser impacts were placed in the desired retinal areas. The lesions generated in the pig eyes were quite similar to those obtained by conventional techniques and they were time and intensity dependent. CONCLUSIONS Photocoagulation with our sytem is very simple and potentially safe and effective. It may facilitate the photocoagulation process inasmuch as it is more comfortable and user-friendly.</dc:description>
