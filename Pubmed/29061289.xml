<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is a rare entity that constitutes less than 5% of nasosinusal malignancies. Mainstream treatment consists in surgical resection+/-adjuvant radiotherapy. By exposing results observed with apparition of new therapeutic options as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the objective is to evaluate a series and a review of the current literature. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted including patients diagnosed and followed-up for ONB from 2008 to 2015 in our institution. RESULTS 9 patients were included. Mean follow-up of 52.5 months (range 10-107). Kadish stage: A, 1 patient (11.1%) treated with endoscopic surgery; B, 2 patients (22.2%) treated with endoscopic surgery (one of them received adjuvant radiotherapy); C, 6 patients (66.7%), 4 patients presented intracranial extension and were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy. The other 2 patients presented isolated orbital extension, treated with radical surgery (endoscopic or craniofacial resection) plus radiotherapy. The 5-year disease free and overall survival observed was 88.9%. CONCLUSION Neoadjuvant chemotherapy could be an effective treatment for tumor reduction, improving surgical resection and reducing its complications.</dc:description>
