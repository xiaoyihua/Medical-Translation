<dc:description xml:lang="en">Treatment of obesity continues to rely upon the classical triad of nutritional advise, increase of physical activity and use of drugs. However, in recent years, there have appeared novelties in both therapeutic targets and new molecules. With regard to therapeutic targets of obesity, success does not consist of losing much weight but attaining a moderate yet maintained weight lose (5-10% of initial weight) at the expense of visceral fat. In other words, instead of weight, what is needed is a waist reduction, mainly to improve or prevent obesity-related metabolic and vascular complications. Regarding drugs, a new molecules is about to appear in the international pharmaceutical market: rimonabant. A selective blocker of the endocannabinoid receptor CB1, it has proven to be effective and safe in treating obesity and its comorbidities. Another known agent, orlistat, has proven to be effective in the prevention of the development of type 2 diabetes in obese patients with or without glucose intolerance.</dc:description>
