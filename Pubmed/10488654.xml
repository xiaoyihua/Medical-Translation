<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the flowgram for the timely diagnosis of the immunodeficiencies congenital primary, based on the demonstrations otorrinolaringol recurrent chronicles to difficult control, with or without associated systemic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHOD Retrospective study, descriptive and observational that included patient with diagnostic of primary known immunodeficiency. They were checked the clinical files to know their evolution and medical treatment-surgical. RESULTS They were found 10 patient with diagnostic of some primary immunodeficiency; this was made based on the infectious symptoms otolaryngal chronic recurrent to difficult control; they were six men and four women between the four and 36 years old. They were found the following immunodeficiencies: one of hyper-IgM, three by IgG, variable common three, a deficit with C3 of the complement, two of IgA more atopia. CONCLUSIONS The chronicle sinusitis or recurrent and the otitis mean chronicle or recurrent can be the only demonstrations of a patient with primary immunodeficiency. The immunology evaluation must include, at least: hematic biometric completes with differential, seric levels of immunoglobulins, the same as subclass of IgG, C4 and C3 of the complement, response to immunization with proteins (diphtheria and tetanus), and polysaccharide antigens (pneumovax).</dc:description>
