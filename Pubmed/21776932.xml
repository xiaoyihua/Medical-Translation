<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hypoglycemia is the acute complications occur more often, people with diabetes mellitus, especially those treated with insulin and/or certain oral hypoglycemic agents. Studies such as The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in type 1 diabetes mellitus or the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) in type 2 have shown that improvement in metabolic control, expressed in the reduction of HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) decreases the risk of chronic complications associated with diabetes. However this reduction is associated with an increased incidence of hypoglycemia, especially in people with aggressive therapy Although in recent years the treatment of diabetes with new drugs (like insulin, new oral agents), it remains difficult to reproduce the endogenous insulin secretion and fear of patients have episodes of hypoglycemia is the strongest difficulty in optimizing the treatment of diabetes, and that adversely affects their quality of life.</dc:description>
