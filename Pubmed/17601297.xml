<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Despite the high incidence of inguinal hernias. In the general population, only a small percentage of them involve the bladder. Bladder wall weakness and bladder outlet obstruction are involved in its pathogenesis. We present our experience in the diagnosis and treatment of this rare disease. METHODS A total of eight patients have been diagnosed of inguinoscrotal bladder hernia and treated in our center over the last 18 years. In most cases, retrograde and voiding cystourethrograms, prostatic and bladder ultrasound, and uroflowmetry have been performed. The treatment varied depending on the characteristics of the herniated bladder tissues and bladder capacity. The treatment of bladder outlet obstruction varied depending on the etiology. RESULTS Two patients presented at the emergency room of our centre, the others were diagnosed at the outpatient clinics of our department. Resection of the herniated bladder tissue was carried out in four patients due to the quality of the tissue; bladder-pexy to the abdominis rectus muscles was performed in one patient; hernia repair with bladder reintroduction was the treatment in the other four cases. Bladder outlet obstruction was treated in six cases. Seven patients showed clinical improvement, showing normal bladder morphology on post operative cystogram. CONCLUSIONS Bladder hernia is a rare pathology often presenting in mid age males. It should be suspected in every male with lower urinary tract obstructive symptoms and associated inguinal hernia. Retrograde and voiding cystourethrogram are the radiological diagnostic tests of choice to evaluate this disease. The treatment of choice is that of the hernia and bladder outlet obstruction.</dc:description>
