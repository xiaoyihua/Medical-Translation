<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Inail data show that in the last years the complaints and acknowledgments of occupational diseases has been increasing, in contrast what happened previously. This growth is the expected and desired emergence of work- related diseases and it's also an alarm bell that the institutions can not ignore. In addition to the data provided by INAIL, the MalProf system gives an important contribution to tlhe understanding of occupational diseases. MalProf is a system for recording and analysis of reported occupational diseases using the source information provided by Service Prevention of ASL. The model used by the Surveillance System MALPROF, by combines the information in a consistent and standardized, assesses the relevance of a causal link between the disease and reports the activity carried out by the worker during his professional history. The two systems (INAIL database and MALPROF), although with some differences have largely confirmed the same data. The past decade has marked the final decline of the working traditional occupational diseases (respiratory toxic substance related diseases and by the accumulation of poisoning, skin, etc....); the hearing loss is still frequent but less important than it was in the past relevance. Tumors and, in particular, musculoskeletal disorders, have been emerging as one of the hidden problems before tumors but, above all, appeared on the scene and the group of musculoskeletal disorders. As indicated by the National Plan for the preventive actions should be directed in several directions: active surveillance, training of the subjects of prevention and other figures, the promotion of the quality of the risk assessment documents.</dc:description>
