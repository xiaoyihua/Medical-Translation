<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND An epidemiological study on intestinal parasites has been carried out in Northern Morocco (province of Tangier, Tetuan and Larache). A comparative Study has been made at a provincial, city and areas (urban and rural) level. Also the SPI (simple parasitism index) and the CPI (comparative parasitism index) distribution. METHODS The coprological method used were: direct, concentration (Fulleborn, Telemann and Kato) method and ye test technics (Ferric Hematoxylin and E. Chlorazol Black). RESULTS The number of faecal samples were 4643, parasitism people 2637 and the total number of parasites were 4816. SPI 56.79% and CPI 1.83. Among the Protozoa, Entamoeba coli, followed by Endolimax nana, Giardia lamblia and Iodamoeba buetschlii prevailed, the other species coming a lung distance behind. Among the Helminths, Trichuris trichiura prevailed much more than the others; Ascaris lumbricoides followed and on the third place were Enterobius vermicularis and Hymenolepis nana. The percentage found for E. vermicularis was very high, since an appropriate technique of diagnosis was not used. The data have been statistically tested. CONCLUSIONS We found a high rate of parasitism in the 3 provinces that have studied and an approximate number of two parasites per person. SPI and CPI are greater in Tetuan and Larache than in Tangier.</dc:description>
