<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the role of Helicobacter pylori infection in dental plaque from 53 children, between 3 and 17 years of age, with recurrent abdominal pain and/or upper gastrointestinal bleeding. PATIENTS AND METHODS Dental plaque was analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for a specific internal urease gene (as described by Clayton). Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy was performed after the dental plaque was obtained and biopsies were taken from the gastric antrium and fundus and analyzed by PCR. An individual interview was performed to know the customs and attitudes about bucodental hygiene. RESULTS None of the children were positive with the PCR test in dental plaque, while 35 children (66%) had a positive gastric PCR result. CONCLUSIONS This study does not confirm the hypothesis that dental plaque might act as a reservoir for this microorganism.</dc:description>
