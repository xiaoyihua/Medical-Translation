<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Spanish Society of Cardiovascular Surgery has sent a questionnaire to all 36 cardiovascular surgical groups to know the number and type of cardiovascular operations carried out in our country during 1988. The questionnaire was answered by 35 out of 36. In the year 1988, 21,438 cardiovascular patients have been operated upon and 9,053 interventions with extracorporeal circulation have been carried out: 46% in valvular disease, 36% in coronary, and 12% in congenital. The number of operations was 5,882 for vascular disease, 4,168 for valvular, 3,279 for coronary, 1,853 for congenital and 2,870 for pacemaker implantation. Comparing with other countries and specially with the Federal Republic of Germany few points in our country deserve a remarkable mention: 1) valvular pathology causes more operations than coronary one. 2) There is a low number of cardiovascular operations per million of inhabitants. 3) The cardiovascular surgical groups have a low yield. The first two points should be studied further by epidemiologists and cardiologists. To increase the yield of the cardiovascular groups it is necessary to have an adequate planning , outstanding increase of salaries and enough technological endowment.</dc:description>
