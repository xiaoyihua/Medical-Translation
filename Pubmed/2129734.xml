<dc:description xml:lang="en">The following were analysed with the object of evaluating a provincial diabetes programme (Institut Català de la Salut. Tarragona Management Areas): a) training activities for professionals in primary health care, and b) some indicators of effectiveness. Between 1987 and 1989, 192 professionals of the institution (89 doctors [46.3%], 85 nursing specialists [44.2%], and 18 members of other health care areas [9.5%]) took part in 8 basic courses on diabetes and diabetological education. A subjective (opinion questionnaires) and objective (written tests) increase in theoretic knowledge was recorded. Continuous counselling from the programme has encouraged the development of 11 initiatives in aiding diabetics (both care and education), in centres in 7 regions in the province of Tarragona, which are presently offered to a reference population of 188,000 inhabitants (30-35% of all users). A provincial census has been started up, with data at present on 2,052 diabetics (189, or 9.3%, type I and 1,863, or 90.7%, type II). A strong increase was recorded in provincial dispensing of insulins by pharmacies (50% higher than in 1985), as well as of material for glucoketonuric and glycemic self-analysis (7-8 times higher than in 1985). Requests for glycosylated hemoglobin from the primary sector rose from 53 in 1986 to 634 over the first six months of 1989. The programme has contributed to enhance the quality of primary aid to diabetics in our regions.</dc:description>
