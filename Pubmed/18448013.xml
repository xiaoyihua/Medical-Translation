<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Cardiovascular disease is a common cause of death in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not clear whether the high cardiovascular comorbidity is due to an increase in traditional risk factors or whether, in contrast, COPD can be considered an independent risk factor. The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of risk factors and cardiovascular comorbidity in a community-based population treated for COPD. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a concurrent multicenter, cross-sectional study that included 572 patients with confirmed diagnosis of COPD. Information on cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidity was collected by extracting data from the medical records of the participating center. RESULTS The mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 53.7% (16.85%) of predicted and the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity was 57.9% (10.9%). Hypertension was reported in 53%, obesity in 27%, dyslipidemia in 26%, and diabetes in 23% of the patients. The prevalence of risk factors was not related to disease severity, but there was a trend towards an association with age. In the study group, 16.4% had ischemic heart disease, 7% cerebrovascular disease, and 17% peripheral vascular disease. Cardiovascular disease was not associated with COPD severity, but such an association was reported for age and traditional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent in patients with COPD. The prevalence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease exceeds that reported in the general population. No relationship was found between the severity of airflow obstruction and the presence of cardiovascular comorbidity.</dc:description>
