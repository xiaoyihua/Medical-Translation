<dc:description xml:lang="en">50 low-birth-weight infants (1,000 g. or less) admitted to an Intensive Care Unit from January 1972 up to December 1974 are evaluated. Obstetrical data maturity and morbidity are compared in order to investigate factors that might predispose survival of these infants. Significant differences in gestational age, birth weight and maturity have been encountered. Mortality rate increases with a low Apgar score at one and five minutes, a low hematocrit an admission, early appearance of apnea, respiratory distress, when ressuscitation was required, need for assisted ventilation and septicemia. Among the factors that improve the rate of survival are: being small for gestational age, early rupture of membranes and temperature on admission above 35.5 degrees (axillary). Problems most frequently encountered were respiratory distress, apnea, infection and metabolic disturbances. Mortality rate was 76%, lowered to 50% among the small for gestational age group. The main causes of death were sepsis, severe hypoxia and intracraneal hemorrhage.</dc:description>
