<dc:description xml:lang="en">The clinical scales used to assess disease severity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients share a common feature: assessment is made and interpreted by neurologists, and, therefore, someone other than the patient. Furthermore, these scales do not assess the health factors that are important components of patient's experienced quality of life. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments include several domains, which are regarded by patients as being more important determinants of their overall health states. In fact, HRQoL measurements in MS are becoming important in assessing the effect of treatment and progression of the disease. This article will provide a review of the most significant studies on HRQoL in MS.</dc:description>
