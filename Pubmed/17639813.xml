<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In general, infection and chronic inflammation have been implied as etiologic agents for atheroesclerosis and in particular coronary illness (CI). Several studies have correlated the infection of Helicobacter pylori with CI, especially with virulent strains (lineage Cag A). OBJECTIVE Demonstrate the immunohistochemical presence of H. Pylori in atheroscletotic plaques obtained from endarterectomy of different vascular regions. MATERIAL AND METHODS 34 atherosclerotic plaques of different vascular areas were studied, (25 men and 9 women). The tissues were fixed with 10% neutral buffered-formalin and decalcifying in formic acid 5% was used when necessary. The tissue sections were included in paraffin, cut and colored with H&amp;E and subjected to Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of H. Pylori. Briefly, tissues were deparaffinized and thermally treated with a citrate-based solution of antigenic retrieval (ImmunoDNA Retriever with Citrate, BIO SB, Santa Barbara, CA) using a water bath at 95 degrees C for 1 hour. The IHC was conducted using a high sensitivity Biotin-Streptavidin-HRP-DAB IHC system (ImmunoDetector HRP/DAB, BIO SB). The microscopic observation evaluated the presence of mononuclear inflammatory cells and the identification of the bacteria in the wall or the vascular lumen. RESULTS Of the 34 cases studied 14 were positive, where one could identify the bacillus in their different forms (41,17%) associated with chronic inflammation.</dc:description>
