<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyze the urinary repercussions in patients with lipomyelomeningocele. METHODS From 1976 to 1993, 20 patients (11 males and 9 females), aged 12-17 years had been referred to our department. All patients were evaluated clinically and analytically, urodynamically and by imaging techniques (cystography, US or IVP). RESULTS Neurogenic bladder dysfunction was observed in 13 patients (65%); 4 of these patients had vesicoureteric reflux and 2 had residual pyelonephritic lesions. These 13 patients with neurogenic bladder were incontinent: 4 were on intermittent bladder catheterization, 2 patient were receiving oxybutinine, 3 were on intermittent catheterization+oxybutinine, and one patient has an artificial sphincter. Four male patients under 7 years will be starting intermittent catheterization. Of the patients with vesicoureteric reflux, 3 were treated with medication and one was submitted to surgery. CONCLUSIONS Urinary tract involvement is not uncommon in these patients. However, it is not inevitable and the degree of severity is variable. Early diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is fundamental for management.</dc:description>
