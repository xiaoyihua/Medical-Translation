<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Describing the bacteriological map of the urinary tract infections (UTI) in our area including intra and extrahospitalized patients during 1997. MATERIAL AND METHODS Descriptive-retrospective study, 12,937 urocultives were carried out in our laboratory: 847 from hospitalized patients and 12,090 from 15 Health Centres. RESULTS 1,527 positive cultures (12.6%) were obteined from Health Centre patients and 215 (25.3%) from hospitalized patients. Bacterial distribution was similar between them, except enterocci and negative coagulase estafilococci which were more frequent in hospitalized patients. We have observed a high prevalence of Enterobacter sp. (4%) and Pseudomonas sp. (4%) which disagrees with other studies. E.coli (presents in 69% of the positive urocultives) was widespread resistant to quinolones, pipemidic acid and nitrofuration, while it had high sensitivity to fosfomicin, cephuroxim and amoxicilin-clavulanic acid. CONCLUSIONS The level of resistance to the quinolones is considerable in our area, so clinicians should give them up in empirical treatment and use fosfomicine, cephuroxime or amoxicilin-clavulanic acid.</dc:description>
