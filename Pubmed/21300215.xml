<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to analyze chest wall invasion, the indication and multidisciplinary nature of treatment, the methods used for parietal reconstruction and the technical problems posed by this procedure in patients with lung cancer and chest wall invasion. Chest wall invasion from adjacent malignancies affects 5% of patients with a bronchogenic carcinoma. Preoperative determination of parietal invasion aids the planning of an appropriate therapeutic approach. Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) improves the study of T-factor and metastatic nodal involvement and distant metastases. As a rule, surgical treatment should attempt complete tumoral resection: lobectomy, resection of the parietal pleura and/or of the chest wall--ensuring tumor-free margins--and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenectomy. We also analyzed the distinct prognostic factors for survival, as well as the indication for induction or adjuvant therapy. Chest wall reconstruction involves recreating the most anatomical and physiological conditions possible in the chest cavity and surrounding muscles. The ideal reconstruction would achieve adequate parietal stability and coverage to preserve functionality, with the cosmetic result being an important, but secondary, consideration. Many materials are available for reconstruction and the choice of material should be individualized in each patient. A multidisciplinary team able to plan and perform the resection and subsequent reconstruction, oversee postoperative management and treat complications early is essential.</dc:description>
