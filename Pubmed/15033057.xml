<dc:description xml:lang="en">It is well-known that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe and effective treatment for some mental disorders in adults. However, its use in children and adolescents is still the cause of some fears which may not be justified. The aim of this article is to clarify and to present the state of this question by reviewing the literature about ECT in children and adolescents, with emphasis on efficacy, indications, adverse effects and limitations. Results from studies in this population group show similar safety and efficacy data as those observed in adults. There exists a misinformation about the ECT technique among child psychologists and psychiatrists. Large follow-up studies are needed.</dc:description>
