<dc:description xml:lang="en">One hundred and twenty five consecutive patients discharged from a chest pain unit (group I, 32 with the diagnosis of probable ischemic heart disease and group II, 93 with the diagnosis of non-vascular pain) were prospectively followed up for one year. In group I (treadmill exercise testing were positive at a high workload in 15, negative in 9 and inconclusive in 4), one patient had non-ST elevation acute coronary event 15 days after discharge and two patients had unstable angina at 3 and 5 months. There were no events among the patients who had positive or inconclusive exercise testing. In group II (treadmill exercise testing were negative in 85 and inconclusive in 5) one patient had non-ST elevation acute coronary event at 7 months and one had unstable angina at 11 months. In conclusion, patients discharged from a chest pain unit, including those patients with positive treadmill exercise at a high workload, have a favorable mid-term outcome.</dc:description>
