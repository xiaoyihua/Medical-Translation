<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to investigate the medical treatment of anal canal carcinoma (ACC), 27 patients (pts) were treated with cisplatin, fluorouracil and radiotherapy, in an alternating schedule. Eleven pts received mitomycin C, fluorouracil and radiotherapy, in a concurrent scheme. Finally, six pts were included in a new outpatient scheme with cisplatin, fluorouracil, leucovorin, mitomycin C and concurrent radiotherapy. Within the first schedule, 25 pts were evaluable and 18 achieved complete response. All of them are disease free until now. With the second scheme, 7/10 pts had a complete response and 5 of them are alive and disease free. All the pts included in the last schedule (6/6) achieved complete remission. There were no deaths related to toxicity. Our experience is one of the earliest in oncology using cisplatin as a first line drug, in the non-surgical treatment of ACC. We think that the use of cisplatin is feasible, its toxicity is manageable, and its effectivity is similar to other schedules, as observed in our last scheme.</dc:description>
