<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted disease. AIM To determine prevalence of HPV genital infection in voluntary asymptomatic male university students. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study in 62 asymptomatic, sexually active male students. Exfoliated cells were obtained from the penile shaft and coronal sulcus. Samples were analyzed for HPV DNA detection and genotyping by polymerase chain reaction and Reverse Line Blot. RESULTS The prevalence of HPV infection was 84%. HPV detection was 77% in penile shaft and 66% in coronal sulcus. The most commonly detected types were HPV-16 (45%), HPV-11 (19%), HPV-6 (10%) and HPV-18 (9%). Multiple infection was found in 54%. The most frequent combinations were VPH11/16 (18%) and VPH16/18 (5%). CONCLUSIONS HPV infection is highly frequent in asymptomatic male university students, high risk HPV types were greatly predominant.</dc:description>
