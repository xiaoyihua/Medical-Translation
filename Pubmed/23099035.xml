<dc:description xml:lang="en">The knowledge of the influence of anesthetic techniques in postoperative outcomes has opened a large field of research in recent years. In this second part, we review some of the major controversies arising from the literature on the impact of anesthetic techniques on postoperative outcomes in 6 areas: postoperative cognitive dysfunction, chronic postoperative pain, cancer recurrence, postoperative nausea/vomiting, surgical outcomes, and resources utilization. The development of protective and preventive anesthetic strategies against short and long-term postoperative complications will probably occupy an important role in our daily anesthetic practice. Dynamic postoperative pain control has been confirmed as one of the basic requirements of accelerated postoperative recovery programs ("fast-track surgery"), and it is also a preventive factor for development of chronic postoperative pain. The weight of anesthetic technique on postoperative immunosuppression is to be defined. The potential influence of anesthesia on cancer recurrence, is a highly controversial area of research. The classic pattern of perioperative fluid therapy may increase postoperative complications. On the other hand, the maintenance of normoglycemia and normothermia was associated with a decreased postoperative morbidity. The high volume of surgical procedures means that the adequacy of human, organizational and technological resources have a major impact on overall costs.</dc:description>
