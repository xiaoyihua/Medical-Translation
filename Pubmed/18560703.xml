<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Malnutrition is frequently found in hospitals, where is related to poor outcomes. There are contradictory data about if prevalence of malnutrition is greater in surgical or medical patients. The aim of this study is to know the prevalence of malnutrition in both groups of patients. METHODS The nutritional status of 189 patients from medical and surgical wards was assessed with Subjective Global Assessment, and data about sex, age, length of hospital stay, mortality, diseases, and wards of admission were collected. Qualitative variables were compared with chi-square test, and independent quantitative variables with Student's t test. P &lt; 0.05 was accepted as significative. RESULTS The prevalence of malnutrition was 40.2%. Malnourished patients have lost 7.3% of their weight, 67.1% referred a diminished oral intake, and 53.9% anorexia. Malnutrition was significatively associated to male sex, greater length of stay, and cancer. Prevalence and severity of malnutrition were similar in medical and surgical wards, and malnourished patients just differed in diseases (chronic diseases in medical; surgical procedures and cancer in surgery). CONCLUSIONS Malnutrition is equally prevalent in medical and surgical wards, probably due to different but highly frequent risk factors, and is related to a longer hospital stay.</dc:description>
