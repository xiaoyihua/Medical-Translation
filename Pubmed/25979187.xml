<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The consortium for the study of thyroid cancer (CECaT), including 20 hospitals and one research institute, was recently created in Catalonia (Spain). One of the first initiatives of the group was to perform a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). PATIENTS AND METHODS The cohort included 1,855 patients from 11 hospitals treated over a period of 15 years (1998-2012). RESULTS In this series, 1.470 (79.2%) patients were women. Mean age was 47.7 (15.7) years old. Age was significantly higher in male than in female patients, 49.3 (15) versus 47.3 (15.8); p=0.02. Papillary thyroid carcinoma accounted for 88.9% of cases. Mean tumor size was 21.5 (16) mm, and was significantly lower in females than in males, 20.1 (14.5) mm and 26.6 (20.3) mm respectively (p&lt;0.001). After a follow-up period of 5.5 (3.7) years, information was available for 1,355 patient, of whom 1065 (78.6%) were free of disease, 239 (17.6%) had no tumor persistence, and 51 (3.8) % had died. The risk of persistent or recurrent disease was significantly associated to older age at diagnosis, male gender, larger tumor size, lymph node metastases at surgery, no signs of thyroiditis in the remaining thyroid tissue, and presence of vascular and/or extraglandular invasion. CONCLUSIONS Patient characteristics analyzed are similar to those reported in other parts of the world.</dc:description>
