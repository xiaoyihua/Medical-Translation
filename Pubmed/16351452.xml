<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To reflect the activity of the pharmacy department within the nursing home s multidisciplinary team, and to assess care improvements received by residents, including a better use of drugs. METHOD In addition to pharmacotherapeutical guidelines and a standardized work procedure listing generic and therapeutic replacements to be implemented, selected procedures were specified in order to ensure a rational use of drugs and to increase the quality of care received by residents in our center. Such procedures will be performed by the center s multidisciplinary team and will focus on caring the caring for so-called geriatric syndromes. RESULTS After an assessment of treatments for 125 patients and a 3-month follow-up, 10 interventions per patient were performed, out of which 4.74 were pharmacist interventions and 5.26 were to increase quality of care. CONCLUSIONS The presence of the pharmacy department within the multidisciplinary team ensures a better use of drugs and a safe delivery system. Its activity contributes to improve quality of care, most notably procedures regarding nutritional status, and the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers.</dc:description>
