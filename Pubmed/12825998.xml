<dc:description xml:lang="en">Population density (number of propagules/l) of Pythium in the irrigation water has been studied in the reservoirs of the Poniente Almeriense (Almería, Spain). These reservoirs are habitually used in the watering of the greenhouse crops of the district. From October 1994 to August 1997, 17 sampling campaigns were carried out, 23 reservoirs were visited and three of them were sampled during three years. 300 ml of superficial water were sampled and analyzed in the laboratory by means of filtration with paper Whatman number 1, placed on Ponchet selective medium and incubated at 20 degrees C. Data of the physical-chemical characteristics of the water (temperature, pH, CE, anions and cations) were taken. The geographical and seasonal distributions of the population were correlated with the analyzed characteristics. The more frequent densities were among 0-100 propagules/l. A population's seasonality was observed, with a maximum in winter and a minimum in summer. When Cl- concentration was higher, the number of propagules/l was smaller.</dc:description>
