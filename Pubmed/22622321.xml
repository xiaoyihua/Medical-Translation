<dc:description xml:lang="en">Systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma) is a generalized disease of the connective tissue, whose etiology is unknown, and which produces fibrosis and degenerative changes in the skin (scleroderma), synovial membrane, arterial vessels, skeletal muscle, and certain internal organs, especially the gastrointestinal tract, lung, heart, and kidney. Patients with cutaneous alterations, which could have been scleroderma cases, have been described since the most distant ancient times, and since the end of XIX century its recognition has been accurate. In the past century more precise diagnoses and treatments were possible because of the knowledge of its pathogenesis and its classification into clinic-serologic subgroups. We intend to recall the names and contributions of the doctors who collaborated with the advances throughout history.</dc:description>
