<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding, is the main route of HIV infection in children. Strategies aimed at promoting the health of HIV infected pregnant women and MTCT prevention have reduced transmission to below 2%. This paper presents the clinical and epidemiological features of a cohort from Madrid and compares foreign-born with Spanish-born women. METHOD Retrospective, observational and descriptive study on HIV infected pregnant women from South Madrid (n=70) and their offspring (n=78) who were born during the study period from August 1992 to January 2010. RESULTS Most pregnant women were infected by heterosexual transmission (51%). Most Spanish-born women (66%) were diagnosed before pregnancy (81%), while foreign-born women (34%) were diagnosed during pregnancy (70%). Foreign-born women had less obstetric check-ups (67%) than Spanish-born women (97%). The MTCT rate was 1.3% during the last ten years. CONCLUSIONS Heterosexual transmission is the primary mode of acquisition of HIV infection both for Spanish-born and foreign-born pregnant women. However, the HIV infection was diagnosed earlier in Spanish-born women. There were no differences in the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy as a preventive measure against MTCT when it is started at an early stage.</dc:description>
