<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Mental health needs of children and adolescents show epidemiological changes and sometimes require psychiatric hospitalization. OBJECTIVE to perform an epidemiological characterization of children and adolescents hospitalized for mental disorders in Hospital de Niños of Córdoba. MATERIALS AND METHODS observational retrospective study, based on clinical reports on 144 cases hospitalized during years 2009-2010. Data was processed using frequency analysis with a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS 54.86% of cases corresponded to women and 45.14% to men. They were aged between 6 and 16 years, showing a higher media in women 12.87. Most frequent causes for hospitalization were: suicide attempt (25%), psychomotor agitation episodes (21.53%) and psychotic episodes (15.97%). Cases admitted for suicide attempt were not frequently treated. Most relevant psychopathological diagnoses were: behavior disorder of childhood in male, and personality disorders in women. Average stay was 21.9 days, cases that needed re-admission showed a longer time. CONCLUSIONS most frequent causes for hospitalization were related to impulsivity-aggression symptoms showing different distributions according to gender. Pathologies must be recognized, diagnosed and treated more promptly.</dc:description>
