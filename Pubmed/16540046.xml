<dc:description xml:lang="en">Psoriasis is a common, persistent, inflammatory skin disorder that can have a major effect on patient quality of life. Conventional psoriasis treatment fail to meet the clinical needs for a save and remittive therapy. The implication of an immunological lymphocyte T phenomena in the pathogenesis of psoriasis has led to research for new treatment options over the past few years. With advances in molecular research and technology, several biological therapies may be employed in the treatment of psoriasis. Biological treatments are designed to modulate key steps in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. They act by: inhibition of activation of antigen-presenting cells, inhibition of activation and proliferation of lymphocytes, immune deviation (from a T1 immune response to a T2 immune response) and reduction of pathogenic T cells and blocking the activity of inflammatory cytokines. Different biological treatments are discussed in this article.</dc:description>
