<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Varicose vein surgery of the lower extremities is accomplished by new noninvasive modalities. In this study we evaluated the safety, efficacy, and recuperation time of radiofrequency associated with miniphlebectomies and foam sclerotherapy to treat primary varicose veins of the lower extremities. METHODS From November 6, 2006 to December 15, 2009, 204 legs in 102 patients with symptomatic primary varicose veins were treated by radiofrequency. There were 74 females and 28 males. Average age was 38 ± 6 years. Preoperatively, each patient had a duplex ultrasound to evaluate permeability, competency of the deep venous system, localization of the reflux areas and diameter of the saphenous veins. Postoperatively, a duplex ultrasound was done at 72 h and at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS At 12 months, radiofrequency was effective in 98% of the patients. In two cases (1.98%) there were recurrent varicose veins. There were no systemic complications. In one case there was burn damage of the skin requiring surgical treatment, due to perforation of the vein by the catheter tip. The mean recovery time was 1.14 days. CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency associated with miniphlebectomies and foam sclerotherapy represents a safe and effective option to treat primary variceal disease in the lower extremities with less postoperative recovery time.</dc:description>
