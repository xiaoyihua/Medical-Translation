<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE If we are capable of 1) determining the correlation, in young smokers, between carbon-monoxide levels in exhaled air (CO) and carboxihemoblobine (COHb) (cooximetrically determined) and 2) adapting the versions of the nosologic criteria DSM-IV for nicotine-depencence (DSM-IVa), Fagerström Test (FTNDa), and ARU-SMQ-9a Test to adolescents, then we may be able to establish how useful such tests are to measure nicotine-ependences in adolescents. SUBJECTS AND MEHTOD: Cross-sectional, observation-based study carried out in 41 schools. 2,647 students aged 10 to 17 years were surveyed. The size of the sample was calculated for eacha nd using the equation of finite population. For each age, the sample was stratified according to sex and type of school. Schools and students were chosen by using the table of random numbers. Teenagers filled up a questionnaire which included DSM-IVa, FTNDa, and ARU-SMQ-9a and were subsequently given a cooximery. RESULTS 23.1% were smokers. The correlation between the levels of CO and the nicotine-dependence tests was: DSM-IVa rho o = 0.3390 (p = 0.0000); FTNDa rho o = 0.5853 (p 0 0.000); ARU-SMQ-9a rho o = 0.4670 (p = 0.000). The correlation with the levels of carboxihemoglobine was: DSM-IVa rho o = 0.3369 (p = 0.000); FTNDa *o = 0.5498 (p = 0-000); ARU-SMQ-9a rho o = 0.4460 (p 0 0-000). The study was based on 583 smoking scholars who underwent the cooximetry. CONCLUSIONS The correlation between DSM-IVa, FTNDa, and ARU-SMQ-9a and the levels of CO and COHb in young smokers is low but meaninful. In our opinion, research to find new, simple, cheap, and easily-accessible tools allowing the correct diagnosis and follow-up of young smokers must continue.</dc:description>
