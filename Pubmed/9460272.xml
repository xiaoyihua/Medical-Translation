<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report a 55 years old married woman without history of drug dependence. Due to a severe marital conflict she developed a chronic adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Zopiclone, 7.5 mg at night was prescribed for her insomnia and she rapidly became tolerant and dependent to the hypnotic. She was admitted to a psychiatric clinic, slowly detoxified and treated with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Six months later, she has resumed her housekeeping and professional activities and is maintained with a benzodiazepine at night for insomnia.</dc:description>
