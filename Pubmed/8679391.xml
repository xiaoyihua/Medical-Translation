<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since Gross established the basic rules for nephrectomy in Wilms' tumour (WT) in 1953, the management of nephroblastoma has been more straightforward; however, some cases with intravascular involvement, currently detected by ultrasound (US), may represent a daunting challenge for the surgeon. Inferior vena cava with tumour thrombus induced by WT can be asymptomatic, and if undetected, contribute to poorer prognosis for two main reasons: possible neoplastic cells inside the thrombus and higher morbidity risk of surgery. From 1979 to 1993, 81 WT were studied by routine US. Intracaval thrombosis was diagnosed in four (5%), in one of which the thrombus extended to the right atrium. In our experience, the surgical strategy in each of the four cases (100% survival), depended on the length of the thrombus and whether or not it infiltrated the vena cava wall. If the thrombus can be easily removed: complete resection. However in cases of atrial thrombus and more particularly if the thrombus involves the intima, we suggest the thrombus not be touched since the problem may be solved by preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy. Thus, the favourable prognosis would be maintained and superfluous risky surgery avoided.</dc:description>
