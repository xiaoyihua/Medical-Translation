<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Teachers may have an essential role in basic life support (BLS) training in schoolchildren. However, few data are available about their BLS learning abilities. AIM To quantitatively assess the quality of BLS when performed by school teachers after a brief and simple training program. MATERIALS AND METHODS A quasi-experimental study with no control group, and involving primary and secondary education teachers from four privately managed and public funded schools was conducted in 3 stages: 1st. A knowledge test, 2nd: BLS training, and 3rd: Performance test. Training included a 40minutes lecture and 80minutes hands-on session with the help feedback on the quality of the chest compressions. RESULTS A total of 81 teachers were included, of which 60.5% were women. After training, the percentage of subjects able to perform the BLS sequence rose from 1.2% to 46% (P&lt;.001). Chest compression quality also improved significantly in terms of: correct hands position (97.6 vs. 72.3%; P&lt;.001), mean depth (48.1 vs. 38.8mm; P&lt;.001), percentage that reached recommended depth (46.5 vs. 21.5%; P&lt;.001), percentage of adequate decompression (78.7 vs. 61.2%; P&lt;.05), and percentage of compressions delivered at recommended rate (64.2 vs. 26.9%; P&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS After and brief and simple training program, teachers of privately managed public funded schools were able to perform the BLS sequence and to produce chest compressions with a quality similar to that obtained by staff with a duty to assist cardiac arrest victims. The ability of schoolteachers to deliver good-quality BLS is a pre-requisite to be engaged in BLS training for schoolchildren.</dc:description>
