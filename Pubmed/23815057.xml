<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Effective communication between professionals is crucial to ensure patient safety. OBJECTIVES 1) Explore the intraprofessional communication process during nurse shift change; 2) identify improvement strategies to facilitate optimal communication process. METHODS Exploratory study conducted from January to May 2011 in an intermediate unit. There were performed 16 structured observations of the communication process and 4 semistructured interviews and 16 anonymous surveys (designed by the evidence, interviews and observations) to the nurses who agreed to participate in the study. RESULTS Strengths: complete process and the usefulness of the computer record. LIMITATIONS lack of common structure, repetition and forgetfulness of information, numerous interruptions during the process and noise. The 68.75% of nurses said that part of the transmitted information was irrelevant and too long. All of them perceived the need for changes in the existing process. Some strategies were identified to improve the development of a guide based on the mnemonic SBAR. It was adapted to the structure of the software as well as a change in location for the transmission of information. CONCLUSION We propose to have an effective intraprofessional communication in order to ensure patient safety. In addition the transmission of information during the shift change should be done through a systematic process in a quiet place without interruptions.</dc:description>
