<dc:description xml:lang="en">Acacia farnesiana, L. Willd (huizache) is a leguminous plant that, because of its abundance, represents a forage resource for ruminant animals which up to this moment has not been effectively utilized. Bearing this fact in mind, the present research was focussed on investigating the silage method efficiency for conservation and improvement of its nutritive value. Considering the high protein content and low carbohydrate availability which characterize legumes in general, the following chemical additives were submitted to trial: formaldehyde, sodium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide (3 ml/100 g dry matter); another variable was also introduced: the addition or lack of addition of molasses to the different treatments, both of the silaged and not ensiled forage. The resulting silages were then submitted to proximate chemical analysis, determination of neutral detergent fiber, pH, ammonium, and acetic, propionic, butyric and lactic acids. The dry matter disappearance percentage in situ, as well as nitrogen protein, cell walls and cellular matter contents were also calculated. For the dry matter disappearance trials, four female goats with permanent ruminal fistulas were distributed in four 4 X 4 latin squares. Findings revealed that the high dry matter content of the ensiled forage (73.6%) markedly restricted fermentation. Nevertheless, the silage proved to be of good quality; as expected, a high lactic acid concentration was detected in silages to which molasses were added. In regard to the dry matter disappearance percentage and nitrogen protein, no differences of statistical importance were found among treatments. However, significant results were obtained in regard to disappearance of cell walls and cellular contents. It was concluded that no chemical additives are required to ensile huizache, as the plant by itself makes a good quality forage.</dc:description>
