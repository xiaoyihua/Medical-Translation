<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The Group on Nutrition of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy (SEFH) recently published the practice standards for the pharmacist regarding specialized nutritional support. One of these standards includes the parameters that should be monitored for a correct follow-up of the adult patient on parenteral nutrition (PN.) OBJECTIVES to assess the level of monitoring of PN patients according to the practices recommended by SEFH. MATERIALS AND METHOD a prospective observational study was designed. Data were gathered from all adult patients with PN admitted to the Xeral-Calde Hospital Complex (Lugo) for a 3-month period. The standards were applied and their implementation was assessed by means of a numerical scale with values ranging 1 to 5. RESULTS Of the 171 episodes of PN, the monitoring level is higher among critically ill patients (3.5) than among stable patients (2.7-2.8). CONCLUSIONS The use of standards is a useful tool to objectively assess the items to be improved in order to provide a quality, safe, and efficient nutritional support. Although the monitoring level is higher in critically ill patients than in stable ones, according to the standards, in both cases it may be improved.</dc:description>
