<dc:description xml:lang="en">This review of literature identifies different ergometers used for the assessment of the physiological and metabolic responses observed during exercise in air (treadmill, cycle ergometer, arm ergometer, bench step, swim bench, and simulated swimming) and water (tethered or stationary swimming, swimming flume, and free swimming) environments. In addition, this review describes the maximal oxygen uptake, respiratory exchange ratio, percent of oxygen extraction, oxygen arterio-venous difference, pulmonary ventilation, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, levels of lactic acid, thermoregulatory responses, and sweating secretion of the competitive swimmer during exercise in air and water environments. Also, comparisons between competitive swimmers, recreational swimmers and runners in the above mentioned variables are discussed.</dc:description>
