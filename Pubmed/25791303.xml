<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Evaluating the applicability of the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) on 22 obese adults (12 women and 10 men) engaged in a physical activity program lasting 6 months. METHODOLOGY This longitudinal study involved using the 6MWT for evaluating cardiorespiratory capacity in people having different levels of obesity who were engaged in a physical activity program. RESULTS The first set of 6MWT results revealed that the intervals having the highest frequency were 439.7-468.7=27.3 % (6) and 468.71-487.71=27.3 % (6). The 6MWT result at the end of the evaluation showed that the interval having the highest frequency was 463.01-501.01=45.5 % (10), without presenting clinical and/or physical signs which could have interrupted the test on the people being evaluated. CONCLUSIONS This study showed the 6MWT to be applicable as an evaluation and tracking tool for obese people engaged in a physical activity program. It should be stressed that the 6MWT protocol must be closely followed when evaluating physical endurance.</dc:description>
