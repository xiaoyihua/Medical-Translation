<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To explore some relationships among immunity, nutrition, and malaria in a group of children from a population with a high endemic incidence of malaria. METHODS This pilot descriptive prospective cross-sectional study was carried out in 1998 in the municipality of El Bagre, Antioquia, Colombia. Both boys and girls were studied in two groups: one group of 51 children had malaria and another group of 49 did not have malaria. The children with malaria had symptoms or signs of malaria and a positive thick blood film. The comparison group of 49 children without malaria (no signs or symptoms of malaria and a negative thick blood film) were chosen at random at government schools or children's centers. For the study the following indices were calculated: weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height. Also measured were the blood-serum concentrations of: albumin, prealbumin, apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), transferrin, zinc, vitamin A, immunoglobulins G and M, interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and lymphocyte populations. RESULTS Of the children studied, 69% presented some risk of malnutrition, and 63% had some risk of chronic malnutrition. With regard to the immunity and biochemical variables, the children with malaria had less apoA1 and albumin and more IL-10 than did the children without malaria. All the biochemical variables showed lower averages in the group with malaria, risk of malnutrition, and immune or biochemical changes, while all the immunity variables had higher averages in that same group of children. CONCLUSIONS 1) The high frequency of chronic malnutrition found clearly indicates the need for food supplementation measures. 2) The low values of prealbumin found could be due to the frequent bacterial or viral infections reported. 3) The serious vitamin A deficiency found calls for a supplementation program. 4) An association was found between low apoA1 values and the presence of malaria, but which one follows from the other is not known. 5) No relationship was observed between the anthropometric indicators of risk of malnutrition and the possible biochemical markers of malnutrition. 6) We found high levels of IL-10 in the children with malaria; this is the first time that this has been reported for Plasmodium vivax.</dc:description>
