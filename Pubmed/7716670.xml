<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To evaluate and establish a relationship between serum ferritin value and haemoglobin level, serum iron or transferrin in volunteer blood donors. MATERIAL AND METHODS We have studied a group of 479 blood donors from Navarra's Health Area V, whose blood cell examination, iron, ferritin and transferrin values were determined. We classified these donors in 4 groups according to their ferritin concentration (ng/mL): f1 (0-12), f2 (13-20), f3 (21-400) and f4 (more than 400). The results were analyzed by the statistical program SPSS/PC+. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and predictive value of the positive test, for the determination of haemoglobin level as an indicator of iron deposits were calculated. RESULTS The comparative statistical study of all these groups indicated that there were significant differences in the ferritin and the haemoglobin values (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively), except between f1 and f2, which only presented and intergroup difference in the ferritin values. In blood donors, the estimation of iron deposits from the hemoglobin level showed a diagnostic sensitivity greater than 90%. CONCLUSIONS Haemoglobin values would allow the selection of those donors that could have an iron deficiency, or a borderline concentration; nevertheless, it would not allow the distinction between these two groups. This last observation is not important because donors that show a ferritin value lower than 20 ng/mL should not give blood. When the ferritin is greater than 20 ng/mL in men, the iron deposits will be adequate in 97% of them. This percentage is about 90 in women whose haemoglobin level is greater than 12.5 g/dL. Therefore, we consider that haemoglobin values present a good cost/benefit ratio for donor selection.</dc:description>
