<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to stress the problems of our hospital, the experience of the Pneumology Service during August 1975 through July 1976 was reviewed. This practice was deemed necessary considering that tuberculosis disease is still important in children but specially in those under two years of age. It is necessary that every child be vaccinated during its first year of life and if this takes place there will be a wider protection against the disease, but specially, complications to the central nervous system will be avoided which are main causes of death in these children. When the parameters to reach a diagnosis of the disease are negative, but still there is a clinical suspicion, one must take advantage of experienced technicians to deliver whether or not it is convenient to initiate a therapeutic test. Finally, we consider that the solution to this problem lies chiefly on preventive procedures including good nutrition, B.C.G. vaccination, improvement of social and economic conditions of the family and hygienic measures.</dc:description>
