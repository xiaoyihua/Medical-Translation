<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Outpatient surgery is currently the standard procedure in 60-70% of the most prevalent surgical procedures. Minimally invasive models in health care have improved basic aspects such as postoperative pain and hospital stay, but there are few publications related to perceived quality shown by patients, such as the need for informal care at home or delay before surgery. The aim of the study was to determine the global satisfaction perceived by patients undergoing abdominal wall hernia repair. METHODS An ad hoc split questionnaire has been completed on satisfaction after a week and postoperative quality a month after intervention by 203 patients operated on for abdominal hernia in a year. Variables included postoperative pain, need for informal care, surgical delay, information supplied, professional management and overall satisfaction. RESULTS A total of 48.28% of patients needed informal care at home. They were largely attended by women, wives or daughters, for a few days. In 45.81% they were discharged on the same day, and 53.2% in less than 72 h. Overall satisfaction in the program of day surgery and short hospital stay was 94.6%. CONCLUSIONS The overall process of satisfaction was not related to age, sex or educational level of patients, while there was an inverse relationship between satisfaction and days of hospitalization and days of pain that required analgesia at home.</dc:description>
