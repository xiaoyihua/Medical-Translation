<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the third most common cause of neurological disability in adults, and 75-95% of subjects suffer from fatigue, which is the symptom that interferes most with activities of daily living and is the most frequent reason why patients have to stop working. AIM To evaluate the adherence to and effectiveness of a course on energy-saving as a way to diminish fatigue and to increase the quality of life in people with MS. PATIENTS AND METHODS This pilot study was almost random (although allocation to the control and intervention groups was randomised, the researchers chose the number of patients assigned to each group), with a control group of 14 patients with MS who showed signs of fatigue. Two 2-hour sessions of the course on energy-saving techniques were given by an occupational therapist in a group of nine patients. Measures were made of the self-efficiency to perform the energy-saving strategies assessment, the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), the Short-Form health questionnaire (SF-36) and the open questionnaire on improvements in the course. RESULTS Adherence to treatment by participants was high (with a mean increase of 2.17) and improvements were obtained on the FIS and SF-36 scales, although they were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The degree of adherence to a course on energy-saving strategies by patients with MS is high. Although no statistically significant improvements were found, patients did report clinical improvements in both fatigue and quality of life.</dc:description>
