<dc:description xml:lang="en">Soluble and membrane-bound aminopeptidase activities in eleven regions of the rat brain were assayed using L-leucine-2-naphthylamide as a substrate. In addition, two metabolic enzymatic activities were compared: lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase. All enzymatic activities showed significant regional differences when the data were analyzed statistically. Soluble aminopeptidase and aspartate aminotransferase activities were significantly lower in cortical than in subcortical areas. Membrane-bound aminopeptidase activity levels were higher in cortical areas. Lactate dehydrogenase activities did no differ between cortical areas and the rest of the zones studied. However, while no wide regional differences were found for the other enzymatic activities, membrane-bound aminopeptidase varied markedly across brain regions: a 5-fold difference was observed between zones. The differential distribution of this enzymatic activity is consistent with the hypothesis that it is responsible for the enzymatic inactivation of some neuroactive peptides.</dc:description>
