<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the pediatric population. PATIENTS AND METHODS All patients seen at the University Hospital Sant Joan de Déu in Barcelona during the year of 1995 in which there was a clinical suspicion of or an interest in discarding tuberculosis were studied. Two types of diagnoses were considered: 1) Diagnosis from clinical evidence without microbiological confirmation, 2) A certain diagnosis including microbiological confirmation. All samples received at the microbiology laboratory were processed by baciloscopy, culture and PCR, Amplicor PCR M. tuberculosis was used as the PCR method. RESULTS Sixty-four samples (most of them gastric juices) from 41 children were processed during the study period. Fourteen patients, between 8 months and 17 years of age, were diagnosed of tuberculosis, Microbiological confirmation by culture and/or PCR was obtained in four patients (31%). PCR was the only positive technique in one child (staining and culture negative) with clinical evidence of tuberculosis. All samples from the other three patients that had positive cultures also had positive PCR results. False positives were not detected. CONCLUSIONS PCR improves the diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis. It stands out because of its quickness (possibility of a 9 hour turn-around time), sensitivity (slightly higher than cultures in our series) and specificity.</dc:description>
