<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze the clinical features, yield of the diagnostic techniques, and therapeutic response of HIV-associated visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and compare the initial episodes to the relapses. METHODS Forty-one episodes of leishmaniasis visceral, diagnosed in 31 HIV-positive patients between 1st February 1992 and 31st January 1996 were reviewed. RESULTS The prevalence of VL in HIV-positive patients in our center was 4.2%. Fifty-eight percent of the patients had AIDS prior to the diagnosis of VL. Fever was more frequent in the initial episodes than in the relapses (90.3% versus 60%; p &lt; 0.05; OR: 6.2; IC 95%: 0.8-51.5), splenomegaly was more frequent in the relapses (100% versus 71%; p = 0.05). The diagnostic delay was longer in the initial episodes (27.2 +/- 22.7 versus 5 +/- 4.8 days; p &lt; 0.05). The diagnostic yield of bone marrow biopsy was 82.1%, of liver biopsy 72.7% and of splenic fine-needle aspiration 87.5%. The indirect immunofluorescence test for Leishmania antibodies was positive in 5.9% of cases. Therapeutic failure occurred in 47.6% of patients treated with antimonials and 3.3% of patients treated with amphotericin B. Those patients who received secondary prophylaxis had less relapses than those who did not (17.6% versus 66.7%; p &lt; 0.05; OR: 0.11; IC 95%: 0.01-1.28). Of the 31 patients, twenty-six (83.8%) died, and in none of them was the cause of the death directly related to LV. CONCLUSION HIV-associated VL manifests clinically in a similar fashion to the immunocompetent's disease. It appears in advanced immunosuppression phases, behaving like other AIDS-defining illnesses. In spite of a good therapeutic response the relapse rate is high.</dc:description>
