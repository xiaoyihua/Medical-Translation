<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Continuous use of oral anticontraceptive agents has been related to adverse vascular changes in the form of venous or arterial thromboses and cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). In our case, we describe a CVA due to occlusion of the common carotid artery after an acute massive overdose of estrogens due to error of dosage when using Yuzpe's system or emergency post-coital therapy. CLINICAL CASE We describe a 26 year old woman with no previous clinical history, who smoked 20 cigarettes per day, did not take oral contraceptive pills and suffered an acute left facial-brachial-crural hemiplegia together with reduced level of consciousness. Imaging tests showed acute occlusion of the right common carotid artery. Etiological study of the patient's cerebral vascular accident was negative. The only etiopathogenic factor to be related was having taken oral contraceptive agents for three days after coitus as emergency post-coital treatment. This treatment was incorrect, since the dose of estrogens was four times that recommended. CONCLUSIONS The continued use of estrogens, especially at doses over 30 micrograms per day, was considered responsible for approximately 10% of CVAs in young people. The risk of cerebral vascular accident is greater when there is associated migraine and/or smoking. We describe a patient who showed that the acute use of high doses of estrogens may also cause arterial occlusion, in this case in the common carotid artery.</dc:description>
