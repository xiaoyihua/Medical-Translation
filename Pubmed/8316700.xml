<dc:description xml:lang="en">Between 1983-1991 we have studied 5,221 two-dimensional echocardiography in patients suffering cardiopathies. Twelve (0.22%) had an aneurysm of the atrial septum associated with atrial septal defect. Eight patients had other cardiac anomalies. The criteria used to diagnosis the aneurysm were: 1) The atrial septum central part protrudes in the atrium. 2) 6 mm aneurysm base. 3) Minimum distance from the base to the protrusion top 6 mm. The aneurysm was located in the oval fossa in 6 patients (50%) and in the other 6 patients the aneurysm was situated in the ostium secundum. The aneurysm base measured 7.79 +/- 1 mm and the left or right septum displacement was of 7.37 +/- 1.82 mm. The left displacement was observed in 10 patients (83.3%) and the right in 2 patients (16.6%). The spontaneous closure of atrial septal defect by the aneurysm was showed in 2 (16.6%) patients and in one (8%) was necessary the surgical closure. The other 9 patients: five rested along the follow-up without any change and other 4 patients died because of cardiac malformation. To conclude the atrial septal aneurysm associated with atrial septal defect in an unusual cardiopathy. Two dimensional echocardiography and Doppler color was diagnostic in all infants.</dc:description>
