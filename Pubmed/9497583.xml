<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The number of foreign or Chilean physicians with pre or postgraduate studies abroad, seems to be increasing. AIM To report the experience of CONACEM in the certification of specialties for Chilean or foreign physicians that studied abroad. MATERIALS AND METHODS The certification process for 90 physicians (38 Chilean and 52 foreign) with studies abroad is reported. Criteria for certification of specialties were the same used for physicians with studies in Chile and results were compared with those obtained by the latter. RESULTS Physicians with studies abroad required additional evaluations with a greater frequency than local physicians, due to the fact that foreign training programs are not well known by CONACEM members. Eighty five percent of foreign physicians required those further evaluations, compared with 66.6% of all physicians certified by the commission. Fifty five percent of Chilean physicians with studies abroad did not accept this additional assessment. Applications for specialties of physicians with studies abroad, were rejected with a greater frequency than those of Chilean physicians (31% and 13%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Physicians with studies abroad applying for certification of medical specialties required more evaluations and were rejected with a greater frequency than Chilean physicians.</dc:description>
