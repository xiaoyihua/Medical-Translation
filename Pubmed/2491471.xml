<dc:description xml:lang="en">552 diabetic patients were studied in order to establish the prevalence of hypertension and its repercussion in angiography. 32% of the diabetic patients studied had hypertension, the rate increasing with age, rising to 37.5% in diabetic patients older than 70 years of age (p = 0.002). It was found that females suffered more frequently from hypertension than males (38.8% and 9.2% respectively, P less than 10(-4)) and diabetic type II more frequently than type I (34.3%) and 9.1% respectively, P = 0.0006). Vascular disease was more frequent in hypertensive patients (42.7%) than those with normal blood pressure (23.5%), (P less than 10(-4)). Vascular brain disease and ischemic cardiopathy were the most frequent afflictions in hypertensive patients (25.1% and 24% respectively); and in patients with normal blood pressure 10% and 14% respectively (P less than 10(-4) and P = 0.005). These results confirm that HTA and DM are usually both present in patients, multiplying the risk of angiopathy.</dc:description>
