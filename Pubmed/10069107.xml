<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Disease by cat scratch (CSD) is a syndrome characterized by regional adenopathies following cat scratch or bite. Despite knowing the etiologic agent of the same, there is still controversy in the diagnosis of the syndrome in daily clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS The cases of CSD diagnosed from 1990 to 1997 with positive serology for Bartonella henselae performed by indirect immunofluorescence were reviewed. RESULTS In 13 out of the 14 patients studied direct contact with cats was reported. Lymph node involvement corresponded to the following regions: axillary (57%), inguinal (28%), epitroclear (21%), cervical (14%), and periauricular (7%). In 35% of the cases, several territories were involved. In 3 patients the adenopathies were fluctuating. Eleven anatomopathologic studies were performed with 6 diagnoses of granulomatous adenitis, 3 reactive adenitis and 2 purulent adenitis. The serology for Bartonella henselae was positive in all the patients with a range of 1/64-1/256. The evolution was favorable in all the patients. DISCUSSION Interpretation of the results of serology should be cautions and always related to the clinical and epidemiological picture of the patient. This technique should be considered as another criteria in the diagnosis of cat scratch disease to the detriment of the cutaneous test.</dc:description>
