<dc:description xml:lang="en">General anesthesia is defined by reversible unconsciousness, lack of response to noxious stimuli, and amnesia, induced by chemical agents. Mechanisms underlying the anesthetic effect are not known. The most prevalent belief was that anesthetic drugs acted on the lipid cell membranes, based on the correlation between oil solubility and anesthetic potency. Later, it has been proposed that anesthetic agents act on specific proteins of the cellular membrane of neurons. Voltage-gated ionic channels are inhibited by anesthetic agents, being some subtypes more sensitive. Clinical concentration of anesthetic agents inhibit or stimulate excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, respectively. Specific receptor agonists and antagonists modify this effect. Intercellular channels (gap junctions) are also affected by anesthetic agents through direct interaction with some of their protein subunits. Thus, anesthesia would result from combined effects on specific proteins acting on neural cell excitability as well as transmission and propagation of nerve impulses.</dc:description>
