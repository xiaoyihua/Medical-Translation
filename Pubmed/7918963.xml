<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the scheduled Paediatrics programme through the health problems cared for and the characteristics of care, evolution and follow-up. DESIGN Descriptive study of a crossover type. SETTING Two Paediatrics clinics in the "Soria Norte" Health Centre. PATIENTS A non-probabilistic consecutive sample of 143 children under 10 during 1992. MAIN RESULTS Average age was 3.69 +/- 2.97 years old. The commonest diagnostic groups were: Groups XVI (26.9%), III (18%), IX (9.6%), V and X (both 8.4%). 83% of the children were not following a procedure, 23% were being monitored by a specialist at the same time and 8% were referred. 36% of those with problems were following a treatment and 51% evolved for the better. CONCLUSIONS The commonest problems are those which are badly defined and endocrine-metabolic ones. The problems where procedures were observed and the patients who followed through some treatment both made up low percentages. It is therefore important both to watch out for problems and to follow procedures more strictly.</dc:description>
