<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyze surgery for renal cancer with venous thrombus at different levels, perioperative complications and prognostic factors associated to overall, cancer-specific and disease-free survival. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of 42 cases of renal cancer with venous thrombus performed between 2005 and 2015. The level reached by the thrombus was established according to the Mayo Clinic classification. Postoperative complications were staged according to Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS Most frequent in males. Mean age 65.7 years. 16.6% were tumors with level II thrombus. Subcostal approach was performed in 58.9%. Extracorporeal circulation with cardiac arrest and hypothermia was established in 2 patients. Resection of metastatic disease was performed in 3 patients during radical nephrectomy. Reoperation was 2.3% while, perioperative mortality was 4.7%. 30% presented with metastases at diagnosis. Twenty patients progressed at 15.5 months (3-55). Overall survival was 60 months. The cancer-specific mortality was 75%. Disease-free survival was 30% at 55 months. CONCLUSIONS Surgical treatment of renal cancer with venous thrombus requires a multidisciplinary management. The surgical technique varies according to the level reached by the venous thrombus. Tumor stage is the most important prognostic factor. Thrombus level influences prognosis, with longer survival for patients with tumor thrombus confined to the renal vein (pT3a) in comparison to tumors with thrombus in the atrium (pT3c).</dc:description>
