<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) is the most used database in the National Health System. The objective of this study is to evaluate the quality, in terms of coding errors of the administrative variables of the MBDS in the Basque Country Health Service. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective, descriptive study by means of reviewing 768 clinical histories from 11 hospitals. STUDY PERIOD the year 2005. The data obtained in the clinical histories were considered comparison standard and the level of discrepancy with the MBDS was established. The administrative variable measured were: sex, dates of birth, admission, discharge and of the first intervention, admission type and circumstances at discharge, department and physician responsible at discharge. The χ(2) was used to measure the between-hospital variability of the percentage discrepancy between the clinical histories and the MBDS records. RESULTS There were 213,091 discharge reports analysed. The percentage errors in the MBDS varied between 0.7% in the sex variable and 24.9% in the physician responsible variable. The variability between hospitals was statistically significant (p=0.001). Good quality was observed in the records of the six variables: sex, date of birth, admission date, discharge date, admission type and medical department responsible. The records were lacking in the date of first intervention and the physician responsible variables.</dc:description>
