<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Mobile health or mHealth, defined as the provision of health information or healthcare by means of mobile devices or tablets, is emerging as a major game-changer for patients, care providers, and investors. An app is a program with special characteristics installed on a small mobile device, either a tablet or smartphone, with which the user interacts via a touch-based interface. The purpose of the app is to facilitate completion of a certain task or assist with daily activities. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of published information on apps directed at the field of neurorehabilitation, in order to classify them and describe their main characteristics. MATERIAL AND METHODS A systematic review was carried out by means of a literature search in biomedical databases and other information sources related to mobile applications. Apps were classified into five categories: health habits, information, assessment, treatment, and specific uses. CONCLUSIONS There are numerous applications with potential for use in the field of neurorehabilitation, so it is important that developers and designers understand the needs of people with neurological disorders so that their products will be valid and effective in light of those needs. Similarly, professionals, patients, families, and caregivers should have clear criteria and indicators to help them select the best applications for their specific situations.</dc:description>
