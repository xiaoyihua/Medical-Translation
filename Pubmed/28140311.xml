<dc:description xml:lang="en">Wandering spleen syndrome is a rare condition in which absence or laxity of splenic fixing elements predisposes to an unusual location in the abdomen and an increasing risk of twisting and infarction. Its etiology may be congenital or acquired and clinical presentation is variable. Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, laboratory and imaging. Surgery is the only definitive treatment for this pathology. We report the case of a 23 year old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant since childhood. On physical examination she was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, with marked abdominal tenderness in the left upper quadrant. Ultrasonography showed homogeneous splenomegaly. Abdominal CT-scan presented an enlarged, eutopic spleen, with swirling and congestion of hilum vessels. Splenic ischemia due to organ torsion was suspected. Exploratory laparoscopy was performed showing an 18 cm in diameter spleen free in left upper quadrant, with varicose veins in the periphery and without fixing ligaments. Laparoscopic splenectomy was completed. The pathology report showed ischemic necrosis of the organ. The patient progressed favorably and was discharged on the third postoperative day.</dc:description>
