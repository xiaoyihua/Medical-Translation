<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe a case of staged conservative treatment of a synchronic bilateral renal tumor, a real surgical challenge. METHODS 46-year old obese female who consulted for fever; bilateral solid masses &gt; 70 mm were detected and surgical treatment was offered. RESULTS Staged conservative treatment consisting in selective embolization of both lesions and subsequent surgery was performed. Right partial nephrectomy with ipsilateral adrenalectomy was done first, and 90 days later left partial nephrectomy. Pathology revealed, clear cell carcinomas with negative surgical margins in both cases in addition to a right adrenal adenoma. After 48 months of follow up, the patient remains free of local or systemic disease with normal renal function. CONCLUSIONS The objective for these patients is a complete resection of the tumors and preservation of as much renal tissue as possible. Conservative surgery has proven to be an effective therapy to achieve both goals in cases of bilateral synchronic renal tumors.</dc:description>
