<dc:description xml:lang="en">To improve the procedures for cardiovascular health care in Mexico it is necessary to be able to perform accurate measurements of the cardiovascular parameters with appropriate equipment and to count with standard values for the Mexican population at the primary health level. Cardiac frequency (CF), systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were analyzed in O2 consenting volunteers under resting (seated) and standing conditions as well as during exercise (30 sitting), and again after exercise under resurge conditions. A direct relation was found between CF, SAP and DAP with body surface and age. The orthostatic reflex (OR) diminished with age. Exercise increased FC, PAS and PAD, which decreased four-eight minutes after completing the exercise in those subjects under 30 years of age, where as in those aged 30 to 50 years these parameters did not return to their previous values. The RO decrement is more pronounced in men, although arterial pressure values are higher in women aged 30 to 50 years. Data followed a normal distribution curve, agreeing with the data reported for altitudes lower than that of Mexico City. Implementing the measurement systems described in this paper will allow early detection of pathology that might affect cardiac activity and arterial pressure that could be related to environmental pollution at the first level of medical attention.</dc:description>
