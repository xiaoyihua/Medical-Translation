<dc:description xml:lang="en">Twenty six patients at different stages of pregnancy and diagnosis of rubella were studied prospectively in order to evaluate the perinatal outcome. Diagnosis was based in the detection of specific IgM or on a four-fold rise in antibody titre (IHA) with an interval of three weeks between one and other specimen blood. The stage of pregnancy was defined as the interval between the last menstrual period and onset of the rash. The pregnancies surveillance was performed with biophysics test periodically. The pregnancies were terminated in base of the obstetrical conditions. The analyzed variables were: Maternal age, stage of pregnancy at the attack, duration of the rash, parity, clinical diagnosis of the newborn. Pregnancy continued in 16 patients and were followed up to the birth of the infants. The frequency of congenital infection after maternal rubella was more than 80% during the 4-8 weeks. Congenital rubella syndrome occurred in 2 newborn infected at the organogenesis period (4-8 weeks). Nevertheless there are 12 children identified serologically which do it interesting the following of these infants for to identify in an opportune form possible structural alterations as late manifestations of rubella.</dc:description>
