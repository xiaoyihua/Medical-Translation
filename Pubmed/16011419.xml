<dc:description xml:lang="en">Radiation enteritis is a complex clinical entity secondary to the affectation of intestinal epithelial cells as a result of radiation in the management of pelvic malignancies that may occasionally cause intestinal strictures. We present the case of a 60 year-old woman who had been diagnosed ten years before with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and who underwent hysterectomy with double adnexectomy and subsequent radiation therapy. The patient consulted for abdominal pain and ferropenic anemia of several years standing, and had negative results following radiographic and endoscopic conventional techniques, reason why she was subjected to a capsule endoscopy study that revealed the presence of an ulcerated ileal stricture, which caused the asymptomatic retention of the capsule within the ileum. A laparotomy was subsequently performed--the strictured segment was resected and the capsule retrieved. The histologic examination of the resected segment confirmed the capsule endoscopy-raised suspicion of radiation enteritis. This case shows the role capsule endoscopy may play in the diagnosis of this condition.</dc:description>
