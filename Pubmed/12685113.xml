<dc:description xml:lang="en">We evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of the long-term administration of levofloxacin in osteoarticular infections. For this purpose, 50 patients were included during the years 1999 to 2001 on an initial estimation to be under treatment with this antibiotic for at least 4 weeks. Forty six percent (46%) of patients were male and received treatment during a mean-time of 122.8 days. In forty one of a total of forty nine evaluable patients (83.7%) outcome was considered satisfactory with a total recovery or improvement of disease. Clinical and analytical series of examinations were performed, with no significant abnormalities being observed. Five (5) patients presented a total of 7 adverse events: gastrointestinal intolerance (3), oral mycosis (1), petechia (1), parestesia (1) and pruriginous rash(1). Only in three cases interruption of therapy was considered necessary. In conclusion, levofloxacin presents an adequate efficacy and is a well-tolerated therapy; both characteristics make it an appropriate treatment for those infections that require long-term therapy.</dc:description>
