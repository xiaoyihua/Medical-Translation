<dc:description xml:lang="en">Complete removal of metastatic lesions can contribute to improve clinical prognosis of renal cancer. Nowadays, it is accepted that surgical extirpation of solitary metastases for patients with renal cancer is the only potential for long-term survival. Provided that the metastases could be technical and functionally resected. This review addresses the current evidence about resecable renal cancer metastases at lung, liver, bone, kidney and other organs. The criteria to consider a patient as candidate for resection of metastases are: control of primary tumor, surgical extirpation feasibility and lack of systemic disease. In patients with synchronous metastases, the surgical extirpation should be performed at the same time than nephrectomy. The clinical prognosis is worse when metastases are asynchronous. After the introduction of novel anti-angiogenic agents, surgery is also justified in patients with good responses. Although, this approach remains in the field of investigation.</dc:description>
