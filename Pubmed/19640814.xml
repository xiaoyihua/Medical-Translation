<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The migration causes the emergence of new diseases in our environment. One of them is the filariosis which, due to the biologic cycle peculiarity, it's weird its appearance in pediatrics. This studio accomplishes a review of all the filariosis cases diagnosed the last years in an Unit specialized in Tropical Pediatrics Diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective analysis comprising 14 patients than were diagnosed with filariosis from 1995 to 2007 in the Pediatrics Unit of Carlos III Hospital (Madrid). They have been analyzed several variables to cope with clinic-epidemiological, therapeutics and evolutional characteristics. RESULTS All patients in the study came from Equatorial Guinea, their ages were between 3 and 15 years old. The isolated species were: 6 cases with O. volvulus, 8 with M. perstans and 2 with Loa-loa. The pruritus was the main symptom in the 71% of the cases. The eosinophilia was detected in the 78% of the patients, and the Loa-loa was the specie with higher figures. The 85% of the patients showed co-parasitation, being the intestinal the most frequent. The diagnostics was established by epidermic biopsy, microfilaremia detection, direct visualization and serology. The utilized drugs were: Mebendazole for the cases with M. perstans and Ivermectin or Dietylcarbamazine for the rest of the species. One child showed mixed filariosis. The cure was successful in the 8 cases that could be followed up. CONCLUSIONS We consider essential to execute a filariosis screening to every patient emanating from endemic area, especially to those with eosinophilia. The diagnostic in the childhood, even though it's difficult, it allows the prevention of the disease development, serious complications as blindness and break the parasite life cycle.</dc:description>
