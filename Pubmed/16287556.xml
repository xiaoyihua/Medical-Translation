DESIGN Descriptive cross-sectional study. LOCATION Area Sanitaria 9's Health Centers, in Madrid, Spain. PARTICIPANTS 480 HPs, including primary care doctors, pediatricians, primary care residents, and nursery staff. MEASUREMENTS Using a self-filled and anonymous questionnaire, we will gather sociodemographic variables and from the HP's office, regarding the attitudes towards tobacco, efficiency beliefs and use of strategies in the advice, and the perceived barriers to give it, as well as the state of change. RESULTS 75.2% of the HPs filled the questionnaire (94.2%, 61.1%, 51.6%, and 88% by doctors, nurses, pediatricians, and residents respectively). 72% ask regularly, this rate increasing to 92.4% over tobacco-related diseases. No differences were made between sexes, professional types, tobacco habits, or previous attendance to courses. 85.8% offers tracing and 63.5% give written advices. Nearly 75% of non-smokers are considered social role models, that against only 40% of smokers. The main barriers found were lack of time and low motivation from the patients. 93.5% consider an specific education necessary to give efficient SCA. CONCLUSIONS Inquiries are made and SCA is given, independently of the smoking habits of the SCA. Likewise, there is a good state of change by the HPs to optimize the treatment of tobacco dependency.</dc:description>
