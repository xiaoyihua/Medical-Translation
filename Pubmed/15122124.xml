<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dental malformations relating to bigeminism, fused teeth, etc., have a prevalence of 0.5-5%, depending on geographic, racial or genetic factors. This in turn may influence the treatment to be provided in each case. Anomalies in the shape, size and number of teeth are more common in the so-called pediatric genetic syndromes, many of which are associated to mental retardation. The present study describes two clinical cases of similar dental fusion involving a central incisor and comprising different and individualized treatment plans due to the important differences in the characteristics of each patient. The first case corresponded to a healthy 9-year-old boy with a fused upper central incisor and a supernumerary incisor in the second quadrant. The fused tooth presented two independent and converging roots with a single pulp chamber. Endodontic treatment was provided, with dental sectioning and composite reconstruction of the crown. Orthodontic management was reserved for a second stage. The second patient was a 27-year-old male with severe mental retardation of uncertain origin, gingival hyperplasia, a large bilobular upper central incisor, and a total lack of oral hygiene. Treatment in this case was limited to surgical resolution of the periodontal problem and the introduction of an exhaustive prevention program involving instructions for oral hygiene (with implication of the parents and care takers). In conclusion, the development of a management plan in these two cases of fused teeth required due consideration of the degree of patient cooperation, which was severely limited in one case -- thereby causing treatment to differ greatly from one individual to another.</dc:description>
