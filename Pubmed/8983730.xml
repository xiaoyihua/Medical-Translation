<dc:description xml:lang="en">The appearance of involuntary movements in the clinical course of reflex sympathetic dystrophy (DSR) constitutes a rare clinical entity. In this context, the most frequent changes in movements are muscle spasms and focal dystonia, although postural tremor, muscle weakness and rhythmic myoclonus have also been described. The disorder is more frequent in young women and in the lower limbs. It may have a focal, segmental, multifocal, hemicorporal or symmetrical distribution. It is almost always secondary to local trauma. The pathogenesis and most effective treatment are unknown. We present the case of a 62 year old woman with muscle spasms of both legs and feet as a complication of spontaneously appearing DSR. The electromyogram showed continuous non-rhythmic discharges with morphologically normal motor unit potentials in both anterior tibial muscles. The clinical course and symptomatic improvement following treatment with benzodiazepine seems to suggest that the disorder is of central origin.</dc:description>
