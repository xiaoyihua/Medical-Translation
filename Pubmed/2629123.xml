<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to assess the alterations mediated by oxidative agents in physiological and pathological conditions, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with dodecyl sodium sulphate of red cell membranes previously subjected to oxidative stress with malonyl dialdehyde generation. The alterations of the normal proteic profile observed were related to the concentration and time of exposure to hydrogen peroxide. The red cell membranes were also treated with the following: (1) increasing doses of hydrogen peroxide with and without peroxidase, and (2) supernatant of neutrophils stimulated with digitonin or activated zymosan. No alterations of the membrane skeleton were appreciated under H2O2 treatment; on the contrary, severe alterations appeared after incubation with H2O2 + peroxidase, giving rise to several peptides with different molecular weight. Striking derangement of the proteic structure was induced by activated neutrophils, which was ascribed to release of proteolytic enzymes and activated oxygen compounds.</dc:description>
