<dc:description xml:lang="en">Using a national curve of fetal growth development, clinical and laboratory characteristics of 100 term neonates small for dates and 130 term adequate for gestational age newborns are studied. A 91% of the small for dates were classified by the ponderal index as having symmetrical growth retardation. At the same time in the 230 mothers we look for clinical features that have been mentioned to produce intrauterine growth retardation. Results showed marked differences (with statistic significance) between both groups of women in relation to: nutritional factors, maternal height, labor activity and presence of oligoamnios. The newborns of both groups didn't show differences, with exception of congenital malformation. The incidence of the classical morbidity of small for dates (asphyxia, hypoglycemia, polycythemia) was no different in both groups. We believe the explanation is that the national curve is more exigent and neonates with higher weight fall under the 10th percentile. We think that in the study group a high percentage of small for dates, are constitutional small and not really growth retarded. We suggest the possibility to use the 5th percentile for better sensibility.</dc:description>
