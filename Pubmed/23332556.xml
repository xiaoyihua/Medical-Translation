<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs) has been extensively studied in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but not in those with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). We determined the prevalence of APLAs among our patients with CLE, and analyzed their clinical and serologic characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study analyzed 182 patients with subacute or chronic CLE who had been in follow-up for 5 years. We selected those positive for 1 or more of the following APLAs in 2 measurements at least 12 weeks apart: lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin antibodies (ACAs), and anti-β2-glycoprotein i (anti-β2-GPI) antibodies. In the case of ACAs and anti-β2-GPI antibodies, only patients with titers greater than or equal to 40 U/mL were selected. RESULTS We obtained a series of 13 patients (4 with subacute disease and 9 with chronic disease). Seven met the diagnostic criteria for SLE and only 1 met the diagnostic criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The prevalence of APLAs was 38% among patients with SLE and 3.65% among those without SLE. The most prevalent APLA was LA, present in 10 patients. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) were detected in 12 patients and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies in 11. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of APLAs among our patients with CLE who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for SLE was similar to that reported in the general population. This, along with the strong assocation between the presence of ANAs and the presence of APLAs, would bring into question the value of determining APLAs in patients with CLE who are negative for ANAs. We also note that there was a high prevalence of discoid lesions but a low prevalence of APS among our patients with CLE who were positive for APLAs.</dc:description>
