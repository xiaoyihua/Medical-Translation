<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Since there is no effective treatment for idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) the determination of possible factors which are involved in the appearance of anemia in this disease may be important from a practical point of view. METHODS The results of the initial ferrokinetic study analyzed in 18 patients with IM included plasma clearance (T1/2) and globular incorporation (U max) of 59Fe in addition to the uptake of 59Fe in the sacrum, spleen and liver in 16 patients. The clinical-hematologic and histologic data of the different groups of patients identified according to the results of the study were compared. RESULTS Three ferrokinetic patterns were observed: 1) normal or increased erythropoiesis (8 patient), 2) inefficient erythropoiesis (7 patients), and 3) aplastic pattern (3 patients). The only difference observed between the three groups was the existence of lower levels of Hb and reticulocytes in the subjects with aplastic type pattern. In contrast, although there was an inverse correlation between the medullar and extramedullar uptake of iron (p = 0.018) no relation was observed between the latter and the size of the spleen or liver. CONCLUSIONS The results obtained in this study indicate that IM behaves heterogeneously from a ferrokinetic point of view.</dc:description>
