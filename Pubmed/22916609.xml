<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In April 1991 was performed the first kidney transplant at the Hospital Central Dr. Ignacio Morones Prieto. In August 1999, formally started the kidney transplant program. OBJECTIVE To describe the experience in kidney transplant at HCIMP. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective cohort study, which includes all kidney transplants performed during the period August 1999 to June 2011. We excluded patients whose medical record was eliminated or with incomplete data for analysis. It describes the general characteristics of kidney transplant recipients, transplant-related variables, initial immunosuppression and complications. The survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The curves were compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS From August 1999 to June 2011 were performed 517 kidney transplants at Central Hospital, of which 411 patients were analyzed. Ten years overall graft-survival was 73%. Both, the history of infection or acute rejection were associated with lower graft survival. The main cause of death, in our population, was infectious processes. CONCLUSION Graft survival at 10 years was 73%, which is similar to that reported in the literature. A history of acute rejection and infection are factors associated with lower survival.</dc:description>
