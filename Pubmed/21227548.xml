<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Rivastigmine transdermal patches for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have potential benefits compared to capsules because of their sustained absorption through the skin, good local tolerability and reduction of gastrointestinal problems. PURPOSE To assess gastrointestinal and skin tolerability and the need for optimal dose titration of rivastigmine transdermal patches in Alzheimer's disease patients previously treated with oral rivastigmine. PATIENTS AND METHODS A multicenter, randomized, open-label study including patients with mild to moderate AD (DSM-IV) previously treated with rivastigmine capsules (6-12 mg/day) was conducted. Patients were randomized to: continue with capsules for 3 months (n=49) or switch to rivastigmine patch without titration (9.5mg/day for 3 months; n=48), or switch to rivastigmine patch with titration (4.6 mg/day for 1 month followed by 9.5mg/day for 2 months, n=43). RESULTS Incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events was 6.1% in the group treated orally and 4.2% in the group treated with non-titrated patches (P=.908). Skin tolerability was good (n=15, 16.7%) without any serious adverse events registered. Patch treatment was considered very easy to use by 72% of patients compared with 30% in the group with oral treatment (P=.0005). 60% of patients were satisfied with the patch, while only 14% were satisfied with capsules (P&lt;.0001). CONCLUSIONS Rivastigmine patches have a tolerability profile similar to that shown by capsules, but are associated with greater patient satisfaction.</dc:description>
