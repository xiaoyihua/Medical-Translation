<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of 100% autologous serum eye drops for the treatment of various ocular surface disorders. METHODS A descriptive prospective observational study carried out from May 2005 to February 2009 which included patients with ocular surface disorders treated with single-dose autologous serum eye drops. Treatment effectiveness was evaluated by using a clinical questionnaire in order to assess symptoms experienced by patients at the beginning and end of treatment. RESULTS A total of 15 patients (24 eyes) were evaluated. Clinical symptoms such as redness, burning, sharp pain and tired eyes improved in 100% of the patients, whereas dryness and sandy/gritty sensation improved in 92% of the patients. The overall improvement of clinical symptoms was worth the inconvenience of venipuncture according to 66.7% of the patients. Regarding tolerance for autologous serum eye drops, only one patient experienced some discomfort when using the single-dose eye drops. CONCLUSION The treatment with 100% autologous serum eye drops improved ocular symptoms for most patients.</dc:description>
