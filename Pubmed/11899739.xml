<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE Bcl-2 is a proto-oncogene known to be a negative regulator of apoptosis, whose expression conferring prolonged cell survival and contributing to tumorigenesis. Inconsistent results concerning bcl-2 expression and the frequency of apoptosis were noted in renal cell carcinoma. To investigate a possible role of bcl-2 protein in renal cell carcinomas, we analyzed its expression and relationship with clinical and pathological parameters, including prognostic impact. METHODS 58 patients diagnosed of renal cell carcinoma stage pT1, pT2 and pT3a N0 M0 (TNM 1997) were treated by radical or partial nephrectomy. We analyzed clinical and pathological parameters including bcl-2 expression in paraffin-embedded tumor samples using immunohistochemical technique. RESULTS Bcl-2 immunopositivity was detected in 44/58 of the samples in different grades of intensity. There was no correlation of nuclear grade, tumoral size, stage or recurrency with bcl-2 immunopositivity. Bcl-2 expression was not related to prognosis if we divided all cases into subgroups according of stain intensity. CONCLUSIONS Bcl-2 expression was not related with any pathological parameters; size, nuclear grade and stage or prognostic.</dc:description>
