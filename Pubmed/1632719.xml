<dc:description xml:lang="en">A cross-sectional study was conducted in order to know the prevalence of hypertension and some characteristics related as age, sex, obesity, smoking, heredity and exercise, in a mexican population; their possible causal role is discussed. Other variables related with the treatment and control of hypertension were explored as the awareness of personal blood pressure figures and regularity of treatment among hypertensives. The global hypertension prevalence was 26.9% (CI 95% 24.0-29.0), male's prevalence was 33.7% (CI 95% 29.0-38.0) and female's prevalence was 24.3% (CI 95% 22.0-27.0). Age, sex, obesity and heredity were the most associated characteristics on systolic and diastolic mean figures. The Prevalence Odds Ratios (POR) were 1.79 (CI 95% 1.4, 2.29) for obesity; for smoking 1.41 (CI 95% 1.1, 1.82), heredity 1.23 (CI 95% 0.92, 1.64), and sport practice 0.95 (CI 95% 0.64, 1.39). Among population studied only 61.1% knew their habitual blood pressure figures, and among known hypertensives only 27.1% were on regular anti-hypertensive treatment.</dc:description>
