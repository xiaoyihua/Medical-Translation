<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The overall mortality associated with epilepsy has been estimated to be two or three times that of the general population. Data from contemporary studies show excess mortality in the first decade of life and the first few years after diagnosis. DEVELOPMENT The underlying disease of which epilepsy is a symptom is the main cause of death in new cases, while the epilepsy itself is a major cause in chronic epilepsy. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is probably the most common category of epilepsy-related deaths and is likely to be seizure-related in the great majority of cases. The mechanisms involved in sudden unexpected death in epileptics may include autonomically mediated cardiac arrhythmia and neurogenic pulmonary edema. Other causes of death are status epilepticus, trauma, burns or drowning secondary to a seizure, severe aspiration, food bolus, and the presence of significant cardiorespiratory disease.</dc:description>
