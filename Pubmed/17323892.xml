<dc:description xml:lang="en">Magnetic resonance (MR) is the most effective imaging technique in the diagnosis of articular pathology. MR arthrography (MRA), with intra-articular injection of diluted gadolinium or physiological saline solution has become more common in recent years. The intra-articular fluid facilitates the detection of articular pathology by delineating the articular structures, separating adjacent anatomic structures, and filling potential spaces that originate in or communicate with the joint. MRA provides additional information about the integrity of the articular structures, especially cartilage, fibrocartilage, and ligaments. MRA has proven especially useful in the shoulder, where most of the studies have been centered. The detection of subtle lesions of the capsule/labrum complex is fundamental for presurgical evaluation. MRA can be used to complement conventional MR imaging in some cases and in others it is the initial technique of choice. Indirect MRA with intravenous gadolinium administration is based on the enhancement of articular fluid caused by diffusion from the synovial space to the articular space. This technique offers better results in articulations with less capacity for distension, such as the wrist, ankle, hand, and foot. This first part of two-part article reviews the current role of MRA in the upper limb. Special emphasis is placed on the shoulder joint, where its usefulness has been most clearly established. The usefulness of this technique in other joints is also described, reviewing the most important anatomic aspects, techniques and applications.</dc:description>
