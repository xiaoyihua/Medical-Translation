<dc:description xml:lang="en">The general situation of pediatric care in Asturias is characterized by the imbalance between the two levels of care, with a high number of hospital beds and staff members, requiring a redistribution in number and functions, and a deficit in staff and material resources at the primary care level, with massified practices and overburdened care activities. The reform of the primary care generates an imbalance between health centers and outpatients clinics owing to the strategic situation of the former and the fact that care is given up to age 14. This problem should be carefully considered. These imbalances between the levels of care are not homogeneous, and they are more or less marked depending on the different health areas; there are wide geographical differences. Therefore, an increase in resources as well as redistribution depending on the attention levels and health areas are required.</dc:description>
