<dc:description xml:lang="en">Laser treatment of vascular skin lesions is rapidly improving. Port wine stain (PWS) is one of the first lesions successfully treated with laser. The pulsed dye laser (PDL) has been developed on the concept of selective photothermolysis and has revolutionized PWS treatment. Even though the response is variable, substantial blanching can be obtained after several sessions. Greater selectivity and better response have been achieved by modifying PDL parameters such as longer pulse width, longer wavelength, or higher energy fluencies with cooling skin devices. It is known that thick, deep or raised lesions present poor response to conventional treatments. The aim of this study is to review the different lasers and other light sources which are developing for the treatment of PWS and other vascular lesions.</dc:description>
