<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED There are many surface treatments applied to dental implants. The aim of the present investigation is to compare the physicochemical characteristics of titanium dental implant surfaces with different surface treatments. 9 dental implants from the same batch were divided in 3 groups and received 3 different surface treatments: machined, acid etched and a new chemical surface treatment called Avantblast. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy were used to image the treated surfaces, and energy-dispersive spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry to provide a chemical characterization of the surfaces. RESULTS The acid etched and chemical etched surfaces had an increased roughness over the machined one. Surface chemical composition had differences between processes, as the surface with the new treatment presented a reduced level of impurities and increased thickness of the titanium oxide layer. CONCLUSIONS Surface roughness of titanium dental implants and thickness of the titanium oxide layer can be increased with a suitable surface treatment.</dc:description>
