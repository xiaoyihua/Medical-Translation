<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To typify the episodes of early detection of cardiovascular risk factors (CRF) and to calculate their frequency by age and sex groups. DESIGN An observational, prospective and multi-centred study. SETTING Twenty health centres distributed in the three provinces of the Community of Valencia. PATIENTS Episodes of prevention of CRF in users of both sexes aged between 18 and 64 who, in the three years prior to the study, had undergone no CRF early diagnosis protocol. They were included by means of consecutive proposal with informed consent. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS The diagnostic protocol of the Plan for Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases (PPCVD) was applied. The variables analysed were: age, sex, number and duration of consultations, CRF diagnosed previously, and CRF diagnosed at the intervention. 632 episodes were analysed, with a mean 1.44 (CI: 1.39-1.49) consultations per episode and a mean duration of 10 minutes 53 seconds. At the start of the study 60.3% of the population did not have CRF, but after the intervention only 17.2% had no CRF diagnosed. CRF frequency after the intervention was: diabetes 4.5% (CI: 3.2-12.2), alcohol consumption 5.5% (CI: 2.2-13.1), hypertension 14.9% (CI: 7.7-22.2), obesity 30.8% (CI: 24.3-37.3), tobacco habit 33.2% (CI: 26.8-39.6), lipaemia 42.5% (CI: 36.6-48.5), and sedentary life-style 54.9% (CI: 49.6-60.2). CONCLUSIONS CRF diagnosed most often after the intervention were: sedentary life-style, tobacco habit and obesity; and the least commonly diagnosed was alcohol consumption. The application of the PPCVD protocol was most effective in the youngest age-groups and women. The "episode" as a unit of analysis is a useful and feasible instrument for investigating the procedures and results of primary care preventive activities.</dc:description>
