<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present a young, female patient with clinical and biochemical manifestations of acute cholestasis who had undergone a 10-day course of 1,500 mg/day amoxicillin 3 weeks before the consultation. Diagnosis was based on the absence of alcohol consumption, negative viral markers and antibodies, normal biliary tract, clinical and biochemical improvement when amoxicillin was withdrawn and liver biopsy with histological changes compatible with amoxicillin-induced acute cholestasis. Because hepatotoxicity induced by amoxicillin alone is rare, we believe it important to communicate this new case and to warn of this possible complication. We also stress that simple cholestasis induced by amoxicillin alone, as presented in this case, has been described in only one report, published 10 years ago.</dc:description>
