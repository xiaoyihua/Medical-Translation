<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Determining the association between the degree of urbanisation and excessive television-viewing and video-game use amongst children aged 5 to 12 years old. METHODS Data from the Colombian National Nutritional Survey 2005 was used in the analysis. Television viewing and video-game use was determined through parental reports for 13,090 children and classified as being excessive (e' 2 hours/day) or suitable (&lt;2 hours/day). Five levels of urbanisation were determined using criteria from the National Planning Department and the population size of the rural or urban settings included in the survey. Multiple logistical regression analysis was conducted while taking potential confounders into account. RESULTS There was a gradual increase in the probability of TV or videogames being used for 2 hours or more as the degree of urbanisation increased. This association was statistically significant for urbanisation level 3 and higher (urbanisation level 2, OR=1,33: 0,89-1,99 95 %CI; urbanisation level 3, 1,35=OR: 1,00-1,80 95 %CI; urbanisation level 4, 1,61=OR: 1,16-2,23 95 %CI and urbanisation level 5, 1,7=OR: 1,17-2,46 95 %CI). CONCLUSION Colombian children living in areas of high-to-moderate urbanisation and population density are at a higher risk of excessive exposure to electronic media entertainment. Due to its multiple health implications (in particular obesity and cardio-metabolic health), such sedentary behaviour should be monitored and its determinants in the Colombian paediatric population must be understand for making effective public health interventions.</dc:description>
