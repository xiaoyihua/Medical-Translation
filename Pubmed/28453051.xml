<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective To identify the awareness, attitudes and practices related to dengue in owners and workers of tire ships, as well as the levels of mosquito infestation in tire shops in Atlántico department - Colombia. Methods We conducted a descriptive study. The variables were described as percentages and measures of central tendency and dispersion. Index of larval infestation and containers were calculated in each of the municipalities studied. We visited and inspected 111 tire shops. 26.1 % (29/111) of these were found positive for Ae. aegypti larvae. The municipalities of Piojó, Santo Tomás, Santa Lucia, Sabanagrande and Luruaco were characterized by a higher larval infestation index. Results Regarding dengue, 90.9 % of respondents considered it a problem for them and their families. 94.6 % know that is transmitted by mosquitoes. 91.1 % know the vector larvae under the name "sarapico", 3.6 % as "gusarapo". 98.2 % felt that there is a relationship between the larva and Ae. aegypti mosquito. 100 % of participantes recognized tires to be a breeding for mosquitoes. 85.7% believed fever to be the most common symptom. 83 % reported accessing the health post to cure the disease. 90.8 % throw out unusable tires as if they were garbage. Conclusion In the population studied, there is good awareness of dengue and its vector. Nevertheless, there are problems related to attitudes and prevention practices.</dc:description>
