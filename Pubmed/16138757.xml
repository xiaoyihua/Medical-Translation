<dc:description xml:lang="en">The first successful kidney transplant in Spain was performed in 1965. It's been forty years already and currently Spain is the country with the highest cadaver donation rates worldwide. The so-called Spanish model of transplantation is well known for its organization and excellent results. These results are the consequence of a perfect network organization. Furthermore, the organ procurement organization--Organización Nacional de Trasplantes--, regional coordinators, national health system hospital network, hospital transplant coordinators, and all professionals involved in the process of donation and transplantation have perfectly well defined functions and work with the common objective of optimizing resources and making the most of the opportunities. Provided that one of the main characteristics of the Spanish model is the possibility of adaptation to the moments necessities, we proceed to review and evaluate it from its beginning to current days.</dc:description>
