<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Atopic dermatitis is favored by exogenous factors, such as air pollution interacting with a genetic predisposition. OBJECTIVE The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of sex and air pollution in the city of Cartagena on the prevalence of atopic dermatitis. DESIGN AND METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study using the ISAAC questionnaire in schoolchildren aged 13 and 14 years old from Cartagena (Murcia). The influence of sex and the schools' location in two distinct areas (polluted and unpolluted) on the prevalence of atopic dermatitis and its severity (described as being awakened by nocturnal itching) was analyzed. RESULTS The prevalence of atopic eczema was 6.3 %. Atopic eczema was severe in 19 % of the cases. Risk factors for atopic eczema were female sex (OR 2.19 95 % CI: 1.59-3. 02) and attending school in a polluted area (OR: 1.83, 95 % CI 1.01-1.87) but these factors were not associated with greater severity. CONCLUSIONS Air pollution is associated with a higher prevalence of atopic eczema and there is a trend that this eczema is more severe. The condition was more prevalent among girls.</dc:description>
