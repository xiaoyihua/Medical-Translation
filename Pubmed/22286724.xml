<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Restrained eaters (RE) are a group of individuals who constantly restrict their eating. However, they usually alternate restriction with periods of overeating. AIM To evaluate the possible association of CRF-BP and SLC6A4 gene polymorphisms with chronic alimentary restriction. MATERIAL AND METHODS The Spanish version of the Revised Restraint Scale was applied to 132 women aged 18 to 25 years. They were divided in a group classified as restrained eaters (RE) and a group of unrestrained eaters. The 5-HTTLPR and CRF-BPs11 polymorphisms of the SLC6A4 and CRF-BP genes were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), respectively. RESULTS There was a significant association between the s/s homozygous genotype for the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of SLC6A4 gene and RE condition (p = 0.033). However, this association was not observed for the CRF-BPs11 polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS The presence of s/s genotype is associated with the RE condition, being the presence of a s allele, a risk factor for this condition.</dc:description>
