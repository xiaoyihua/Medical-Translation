<dc:description xml:lang="en">Blastocystis hominis is found in about 25% of feces in normal asymptomatic people. Its pathogenic role is still discussed. A prospective study was performed to determine the prevalence of B. hominis infection in schoolchildren from Bolivar City. We evaluated 446 children, between five and fourteen years old, both sexes, using direct examination of feces and Willis Method. They were also evaluated clinically. Results showed that B. hominis had a prevalence of 16.8%. We did not find a statistically significant association between sex (P &gt; 0.05) or age and infection with B. hominis (x2 = 1.94 g.l = 4). In 39 schoolchildren (52.0%) we identified other parasites along with B. hominis, the most frequent was Trichuris trichiura as helminth and Giardia lamblia as protozoan. We observed B. hominis alone in 36 cases (48.0%). There was a spectrum of clinical symptoms in 41 (54.7%) of all children evaluated. Diarrhea was the most frequently clinical manifestation observed. Other studies are necessary to determine clinical relevance of B. hominis in school population in Bolivar City.</dc:description>
