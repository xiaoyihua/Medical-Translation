<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this paper we describe the surgical management and postoperative recurrence of preauricular fistula (PAF) since the surgical treatment is characterized by high recurrence rates. All clinical, operative and postoperative data were collected from a retrospective review of patients's charts who underwent primary surgical management between January 2001 and December 2006 at five Hospitals in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Thirty-eight patients (15 male, 23 female) with PAF underwent 44 surgical procedures. Recurrent acute infection and discharge were the most common symptoms. The surgical management included 25 standard techniques (sinectomy) and 19 supra-auricular approaches. The overall rate of recurrence was 59%, it differed widely between surgical techniques employed. The 52.2% recurrence rate of standard technique was significantly higher than the 6.8% recurrence rate of the supra-auricular approach (p = 0.01). Also, the patients in whom a portion of the cartilage of the helix was not excised from the base of the tract, 84.6% recurred vs. 15.3% when cartilage was excised (p = 0.01). Our experience has shown that independently of clinical presentation of PAF, the standard technique and not to remove a portion of the cartilage at the base of the helix contributed to recurrence. We advise the supra-auricular approach particularly when there are abscess prior to surgery.</dc:description>
