<dc:description xml:lang="en">To describe the association between invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and steroid treatment in patients with no immunodepression attributable to other causes. We reviewed the case histories of apparently non immunodepressed patients in our hospital with histological diagnoses of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis between 1992 through 1996. Seven patients were identified. Laboratory, clinical and radiological data were collected, as well as type and duration of steroid treatment. Four patients suffered underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1 had temporal arteritis, 1 interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and 1 a neurological tumor. All had received steroid treatment for periods varying from several days to 16 months, at varying doses, although the majority of them were treated with 1mg/kg/day. All presented clinical profiles suggestive of pneumonia (5 community acquired and 2 nosocomial). Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis can appear in minimally immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing steroid treatment and must be suspected whenever pneumonia is seen in patients receiving steroids who do not improve with widespectrum antibiotic treatment.</dc:description>
