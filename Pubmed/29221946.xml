<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES 1-To know the preventive prescription (statin, antiplatelet drugs, bisphosphonates, calcium and vitamin D and Vit B12) of elderly patients previously identified as a CCD (with a complex chronic disease) and ACD (with advanced chronic disease and lifetime expectancy of less than 12 months) who died during 2015. 2-To assess the correct indication of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) to determine potentially avoidable medication. DESIGN Retrospective observational study. LOCATION Four Primary Health Centres, Castellar del Vallès (Barcelona). PARTICIPANTS 128 patients, 70 ACD and 58 PCC. MAIN MEASUREMENTS Number of drugs at the time of death from the 6 selected group, deprescription (6 months prior to death due to advanced chronic disease), primary or secondary prevention and inappropriate prescription of PPI. RESULTS Average age of 85'3 years (10,3). 40% took an antiplatelet drug, avoidable in 60% of the ACD, since they did not present any previous cardiovascular episode. 20% of the patients took statins, in which 48% of the cases were primary prevention. The PPI prescription was 67% with inadequate indication for use in 49% of these cases. 20% took calcium / Vitamin D and 1,6% of the ACD a bisphosphonate. There was a 16% deprescription. CONCLUSIONS A high percentage of our patients with advanced chronic disease and short life expectancy still continue to take preventive and avoidable treatments, potentially dangerous due to their side effects. There is a need to reflect on what we do with these vulnerable patients.</dc:description>
