<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim was to determine: 1) whether Enalaprilat (0.08 mg/kg/min) administration: a) before ischemia or b) at the beginning of reperfusion improved the postischemic systolic and diastolic dysfunction ("stunned myocardium") and attenuated the "hyperfunction" phase at the beginning of reperfusion; and 2) whether creatine kinase (CPK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities, and lactate release are involved in the protective effects of Enalaprilat. An isolated isovolumic rabbit heart preparation was used as experimental model and subjected to 15 minutes of ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, without (group 1), and with Enalaprilat before the ischemia (group 2) and at the beginning of reperfusion (group 3). Left ventricular developed pressure, and end diastolic pressure (diastolic stiffness) were measured and the time constant of isovolumic relaxation (t, Tau) and the ratio between +dP/dtmax and -dP/dtmax were calculated. For the determinations of lactate release and CPK and LDH activities in the perfusate, samples were taken from the coronary effluent for spectrophotometrical measurements. In comparison to the stunned group (group 1) both Enalaprilat preischemia (group 2) and postischemia (group 3) exerted a significant protective effect on the postischemic recovery of contractile state and diastolic stiffness, and attenuated the "hypercontractile" phase in both groups. However Enalaprilat failed to improve myocardial relaxation. Lactate release was also attenuated, but the enzyme activities were not modified.</dc:description>
