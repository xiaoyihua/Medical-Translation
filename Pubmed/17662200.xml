<dc:description xml:lang="en">Study of the human proteome has given rise to the appearance of abundant and increasing scientific literature. This has resulted in the proposal to use proteomic techniques in the management of some diseases and the suggestion of its future use in clinical laboratories. In order to identify which proteomic techniques are being used or may be used in the near future in the clinical practice, a survey was made to experts in proteomics and the bibliometric study was done. Concordance between this study and a survey was observed. However, in general, standardized uses of proteomic techniques in the current clinical practice were not found. In regards to possible applications in the short-middle term, the experts have different opinions, from those who mention specific techniques (coinciding with the most repeated aspects of the bibliometric study) to those who think that its use in a near future is unlikely.</dc:description>
