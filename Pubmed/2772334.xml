<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present the results of a large study (1.282 patients) carried out in non insulin dependent diabetic patients recruited in the frame of primary care, and treated with Glipizide during 1985 and 1986. We have basically evaluated the overall efficacy of the treatment during 6 1/2 months, with a variable dose of Glipizide established in accordance with the patient's needs, starting with a minimum dose of 2.5 mg (10-30 min. before meals), according to the glycemic control reached. Tolerance was evaluated by laboratory tests and adverse events recorded. In most (83%) of the non insulin dependent diabetic cases previously controlled only with diet, the treatment with Glipizide affords a satisfactory glycemic control, as well as in most of the cases previously treated with other oral hypoglycemias (63%). The median decrease of hyperglycemia has been very significant, with plasma levels under 140 mg/dl (fasting plasma glycemic values), and under 175 mg/dl (postprandial plasma glycemic values), with normal HbA1 levels (less than 8%). This decrease is higher in initial fasting glycemia greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl. Side-effects were scarce (4.2%), mostly gastro-intestinal in previously treated patients (2.7%), with only 2.1% hypoglycemia, usually mild and transient. Treatment with Glipizide went on in 95% of previously untreated patients and in 90% of patients with previous oral hypoglycemias, with a mean daily dose of 10 mg (2 tablets).</dc:description>
