<dc:title xml:lang="en">Comparing the clinical effectiveness of two cryotherapy techniques for the treatment of plantar warts</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective. To compare two techniques of Cryotherapy for clinical effectiveness, pain, and effect on the quality of life of patients when treating plantar warts. Method. A quasi-experimental matched subject study was conducted. Twenty subjects with a newly diagnosed plantar wart were recruited. Subjects were matched for confounding variables in relation to site of lesion, gender and age, and were divided into two groups. Group A (n=10) were treated using the CO2 Gun &amp; Probe technique whilst Group B (n=10) were treated using the Portable N2 O pressurized spray technique. The plantar warts were measured at time 0 (before treatment) and Time 1(3 weeks following treatment) using a metre ruler. The Foot Function Index and the Visual Analog Scale for pain assessment during treatment were also used. Results. The study found no significant difference in the effectiveness (p= 0.387), pain caused during treatment (P=0.855) and FFI scores (p=0.172) for total change in QOL in the study group when comparing both treatments. However, comparison of the mean scores showed that the CO2 Gun &amp; Probe method was slightly more effective in reduction of size. Pain during treatment was almost identical when using both techniques. The FFI scores on all 3 subscales (Pain, Disability and Activity Limitation) showed a larger increase in the CO2 Gun &amp; probe method, when compared to the pressurized N2 O Portable device. Conclusions. Although this study has found no significant difference between two different techniques of cryotherapy, mean differences have indicated that the CO2 Gun &amp; Probe technique is more effective in reducing the size of the warts when compared to the N2 O Pressurized Spray Technique; however the CO2 Gun &amp; Probe technique caused a larger impact on quality of life. Recommendations from this study suggest that careful consideration is required when selecting a treatment for plantar warts and furthermore patients should be advised on the likely outcomes of each treatment before any intervention (AU)</dc:description>
