<dc:description xml:lang="en">The acceptance of incorporating courses in liberal arts to the present curriculum of the School of Medicine was assessed. A survey was suministred to 400 subjects that belonged to academic and professional fields of medicine. The results from the survey showed that those who played an acting role in the current curriculum were receptive to innovations. The professors of the clinical aspect of medicine and the practicing physicians were more receptive to curricular change. First year medical students were more receptive than seniors. This positive view constitutes a strong argument for eliciting curricular creativity. These results allow future changes around the medical education of the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine.</dc:description>
