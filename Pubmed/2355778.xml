<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study reports the epidemiologic features of primary biliary cirrhosis in patients admitted to the 12 de Octubre Hospital in Madrid between 1974 and 1988. Among the 54 patients recruited, 45 lived in the hospital surroundings. Ninety-three percent were women with a mean age of 53.7 +/- 15.1 years (range 25 to 76 years). The maximal incidence of the disorder occurred in patients above 60 years. At the time of diagnosis 37.8% were asymptomatic and the mean time to symptoms was 20.1 +/- 18.1 months. The year incidence was maximal in 1982, being the mean year rate of 7.45 +/- 4.9 cases/10(6) inhabitants. This rate was lower in women above 25 years (13.9 +/- 8 cases/10(6) inh/yr). A comparable incidence has been reported in Catalonia and Asturias but it was higher in Navarre. During the study period the prevalence of the illness has increased. By december 1988 the mean incidence for the whole group was 45.5 cases/10(6) inh/yr, whereas it reached 134.1 cases/10(6) ihn/yr in women above 25 years. Environmental, genetic or personal factors contributing to the development of the illness have not been encountered. There was, however, a relationship between the mortality and morbidity rates with the severity of the symptoms and with the degree of histological damage.</dc:description>
