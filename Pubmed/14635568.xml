<dc:description xml:lang="en">Caspases are key proteins for the transduction and ejection of the apoptotic signals induced by several stimuli. These proteins are present within the cell as inactive precursors that need a proteolytic cleavage in order to be active. There are two main caspases group, the initiators and executors. The formers are activated by autoproteolysis when translocated to specific cell compartments or trough the coupling of adapters and or activators. The executors caspases are activated by cleavage of an initiator caspase. These proteases are responsible then for the final cleavage of diverse substrates that mediate the morphologic changes during apoptosis. Among these there are signalization, DNA repairing, structure, transcription proteins, etc. Caspases represent a new paradigm in the signal transduction pathway, and are implicated in a large number of physiologic and pathologic processes. In a near future they could be useful pathologic markers and therapeutic targets.</dc:description>
