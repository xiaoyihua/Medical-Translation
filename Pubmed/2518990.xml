<dc:description xml:lang="en">The results obtained in the program "Control of overweight in children" in the programmed nurse clinic were evaluated in 25 children distributed for age and degree of overweight. The activities carried out were: control of the number of calories based on carbohydrate and fat reduction, health education using the audiovisual techniques of the program EDALNU of the Ministry of Health, and theoretical program based on it. The group with a greater overweight (higher than 20%) followed, in addition, a 1,500 calories diet. It was concluded that a balanced diet and physical exercise proved to be highly effective for the reduction of overweight in children without additional drug intervention. Obesity in children is a health problem that can be addressed in a primary care context; the role of the nursing staff is crucial through health education activities.</dc:description>
