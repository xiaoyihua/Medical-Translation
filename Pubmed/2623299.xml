<dc:description xml:lang="en">With the aim to attesting the ability of treated pericardial tissue to resist infection we analyzed the incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis in 541 operative survivors with the Ionescu-Shiley (I-S) valve since January 1977. A total of 580 valves were available for the study, 21 (3.8%) sustained I-S endocarditis or 0.65% patients/annum. The mean age was 53.2 years; male/female ratio was 16/5. Native endocarditis was present in 20 cases (3.6%). There were 13 aortic endocarditis (2 in cases of multiple replacement) and eight mitral. The interval between insertion and endocarditis ranged from 2 weeks to 108 months (means 31); 8 cases were early I-S endocarditis (38%) and 13 late endocarditis (62%). The organisms isolated were: Staphylococcus (epidermidis, aureus) in 10 cases. Streptococcus (viridans, fecalis) in 7 cases, gram negative in three and no organism was cultured in 3 cases. The outcome was as follows: specific medical treatment in 4 cases (one early), valve re-replacement in 11 (four early) from whom eight survived, and 6 patients died with unspecific medical treatment. The total mortality rate 9/21 (43%), in early endocarditis 5/8 (62.5%) and in late endocarditis 5/13 (38%). Operative and necropsy findings in 12/21 showed always periprosthetic abscess but no leaflet perforations. The rate of I-S valve endocarditis compares favourably with other valve substitutes. Early re-replacement combined with adequate antibiotic treatment is mandatory according to our experience.</dc:description>
