<dc:description xml:lang="en">With the aim of improving knowledge about the geographical distribution of malignant tumors in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, incidence rates standardized by age of the 13 most frequent cancer types in each sex were analyzed, in relation to the 27 geographical regions the Community was divided into. In order to carry out this population based descriptive study correspondence analysis was used. By retaining the first two factors 42% of the variance was explained in the case of men, and 40% in the case of women. The main finding in the male sex was the marked inequality between Rural Alava and the Mining Area of Bizkaia. The latter was characterized by lymphomas and neoplasms of larynx, and the former by neoplasms of pancreas and prostate and leukaemias. It was also found a geographical pattern distinguished by the difference among regions located in the coast and those located in the inner. This last pattern was the most relevant result in the female sex, cancer of oral cavity, malignant melanoma of skin and leukaemias being responsible for the coast pattern, and neoplasms of gallbladder, lung and stomach for the inner pattern. The findings of this study confirm the interest of Correspondence Analysis as an exploratory method and may encourage other investigators to use it much more frequently.</dc:description>
