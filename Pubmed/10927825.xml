<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To find the satisfaction of patients undergoing minor surgery at health centres and describe the processes. DESIGN Retrospective study of population seeking the service. SETTING Health district. PATIENTS 160 people who had minor surgery during a year. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Descriptive variables of everyone who had minor surgery were analysed: age, sex, type of intervention, pre-surgical diagnosis, anatomical-pathological diagnosis and informed consent. Over three weeks the patients were interviewed by phone with use of a satisfaction questionnaire. 160 interventions took place, 80% of which were then studied histologically, with an 83.16% concordance index. 65% of patients were interviewed. 15% had no telephone, 20% were not found, 95.56% considered they were well attended and 3.17% badly attended. 92.06% would choose the health centre again for procedures of a similar nature. 89.9% thought that the explanations they had received were sufficient. 4.4% thought that the room's hygiene was poor. CONCLUSIONS Minor surgery in primary care was favourably received by users. Activity at our centre had good anatomical-pathological concordance.</dc:description>
