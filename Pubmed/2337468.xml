<dc:description xml:lang="en">To determine the correlation between the bacterial flora of vagina or amniotic fluid of the mother and the oral cavity of the newborn, we made a prospective bacteriologic study in 43 newborns; 18 of them were born by cesarean section and 25 by vaginal delivery. The samples for the study were taken at birth, at 12 and 24 hours of life. In the newborns delivery by cesarean section was not correlation between the microorganism founded in amniotic fluid and neonatal oral cavity. In the neonates obtained by vaginal delivery there was correlation between the microorganisms in the oral cavity and the maternal vaginal flora. The results support the hypothesis that the bacteria colonize the oral cavity at birth comes from the vaginal cavity contamination of the mother.</dc:description>
