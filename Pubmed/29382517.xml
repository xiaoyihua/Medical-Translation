<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In patients with septic shock, excessive fluid administration can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between fluid balance, acute kidney injury and mortality in patients with septic shock. METHODS A study of cases and controls was conducted in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. The fluid balance in the first 72h and the presence of acute kidney injury was compared in patients diagnosed with septic shock who died against patients who survived the same condition. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS Forty-five cases and forty-five controls were included in the analysis. Mortality was associated with Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM III) ≥ 26 points (OR 7.5, 95% CI 2.8-18.7; p=0.000), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) ≥ 24 points (OR 11.0, 95% CI 4.1-29.4; p=0.000), creatinine ≥ 0.65mg/dl (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.2-13.9; p=0.000), lactate ≥ 2.5 mmol/l (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.9; p=0.033), SvO2 &lt; 60% (OR 4.6, 95% CI 4.5-4.5; p=0.001), positive balance &gt; 9% in 72h (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.6-11.7; p=0.003), acute kidney injury (OR 5.7, 95% CI: 2.2-15.1; p=0.000). In the multivariate model, the values of PRISM ≥26 and PELOD ≥24 points were significant. CONCLUSIONS In patients who died due to septic shock, the multivariate model showed an association with PRISM ≥26 and PELOD ≥24 and a trend toward association with SvO2 &lt;60% and positive balance of liquids &gt; 9%.</dc:description>
