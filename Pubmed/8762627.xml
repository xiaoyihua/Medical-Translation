<dc:description xml:lang="en">Social perception of medical performance, although biased by emotional factors, prejudices of false interpretations, reflects people's expectations and satisfaction with medical acts. The violation of essential values by physicians, underlies the frequent disrepute of their professional behavior. Physicians are judged by their human behavior and relationships with patients rather than by their technical efficiency. The progressive medicalization of environment, the medical acts subjected to market laws, the conflicts of interest, the needs for accomplishment against diseases and the contradictory disarrangement of physicians behind health providing services, contribute to discredit and lack of confidence towards medical profession. To protect it against these risks, a profound revision of ethical principles is imperative.</dc:description>
