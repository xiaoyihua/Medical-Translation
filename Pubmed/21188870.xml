<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION presence of necrotic tissue in the wounds, high bacterial load and high levels of exudate have been identified as the main barriers to wound healing. Iodinated cadexomer, recently marketed in Spain, allows osmotic-autolytic debridement, exudate management and infection control. This study aims to assess, in real clinical conditions and in an exploratory way the utility of iodinated cadexomer in the treatment of wounds with significant necrotic tissue. METHODS observational descriptive study of a series of clinical cases with patients presenting chronic wounds with devitalized tissue and clinical signs of local infection, with wounds of any etiology and treated with iodinated cadexomer (Iodosorb). Patients were followed for 10 dressing changes or until healing if it was before 10 dressing changes. RESULTS 70% of the lesions presented clean granulation tissue with 10 dressing changes. The management of infection and exudation also had good results. The clinical signs of infection disappeared after the fifth change of dressing, a fact which was entirely confirmed in the eighth. In relation to the management of exudate, more than 70% of the injuries were no longer infected in the second change of dressing and over 50% of the injuries had happened to have a slight or no exudate. Erythema and maceration of surrounding skin also showed significant improvement. An added value of the data is that six of the 21 lesions healed during the study and that pain was reduced sharply from a score of 6.5 to 3 on the second change of dressing and from zero to five, resulting in a substantial improvement in quality of life of these people. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS this study suggests that iodinated cadexomer is useful for wound debridement, while reduces clinical signs of local infection and exudate levels normally associated with these situations.</dc:description>
