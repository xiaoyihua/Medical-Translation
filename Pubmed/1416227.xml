<dc:description xml:lang="en">In 1976, by first time, Cook used the chronic medullar stimulation (CMS) for the treatment of chronic arteriopathies at the limbs in patients with distal ischemic ulcerations. Up to now, some studies about this procedure have been published. Results, poor at first, have presented an important improvement with the time and the better choosing of patients. In 1981, Neglio used by first time CMS as a treatment of vasospastic disease, with excellent results. With this procedure, pain and vasospastic crisis disappeared and re-epithelialization of ischemic ulcerations is found. In this article, we presented a case interesting because it show the different possibilities of this method as a symptomatic treatment of such kind of disease. Patient, with a Raynaud syndrome secondary to an sclerodermia treated previously by medical and surgical procedures, was treated, in different times, with CMS because of digital ischemic ulcerations in both hands. Results were positives and ulcerations healed.</dc:description>
