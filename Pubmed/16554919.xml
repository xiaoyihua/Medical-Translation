<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The seroprevalence of antibodies against hepatitis A virus (HAV) is decreasing in many Latin American countries, along with improvements in sanitary standards. However, there is no information available about low socioeconomic status (LSE) populations. AIM To assess the evolution of hepatitis A and E virus antibodies in a cohort of LSE Chilean children. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred sixty eight children aged four years, 97 males, coming from public primary care clinics, were studied. Two blood samples were obtained with an interval of one year. Anti-HAV and anti-hepatitis E virus (HEV) antibodies, were detected by ELISA using Abbott kits. RESULTS Anti-HAV was positive in 19 children (11.3%). After one year of follow-up, only 10 children had sustained reactivity (52.6%). Fourteen children, initially negative, became positive during the follow up (9.4%). Antibody titers to HAV were significantly higher in samples that remained positive, compared with those that lost reactivity. Anti-HEV was found positive in two children (1.2%). One remained positive and the other became negative. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of LSE Chilean children, the prevalence to antibodies against HAV and HEV is low. Follow-up detected loss of reactivity to HAV in nearly one half of the children, probably related to lower antibody levels.</dc:description>
