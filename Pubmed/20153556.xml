<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to describe the changes caused by the Law on Tobacco and its consumption in workers who are active smokers. DESIGN A post-intervention follow up study of a cohort of users. SETTING Health Centres in Valencia and Majorca. PARTICIPANTS Users who attended health centres. INTERVENTION The field work consisted of each patient filling in a case report form with the requested information. MAIN MEASUREMENTS The variables collected were, sex, place of work, education level, number of workers in the company, number of cigarettes smoked. They were told that on the following day they had to count the cigarettes smoked throughout the day, noting whether they had been smoked during or outside working hours. If they smoked during working hours, they reported whether it was inside or outside the workplace. On the following day they were telephoned to let us know the number of cigarettes smoked. This telephone call was repeated at six months and eighteen months. RESULTS Smoking prevalence and the number of cigarettes smoked in the workplace has been reduced by 9% per month. The variables associated with compliance with the law were education level, the sex of the worker, and the size of the company. CONCLUSIONS The coming into force of the Tobacco Law has been effective.</dc:description>
