<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To define the different characteristics of transdermal oxybutynin (TO) for the treatment of overactive bladder in adults, to know the barriers for the use of this drug and to establish proposals to minimize these barriers. METHODS Local sessions were held with 111 urologists from all over the country divided into 12 sessions. They were moderated by a brainstorming technique led by an external consultant. RESULTS 75% of experts believe that tolerability and clinical efficacy (50%) are the most important attributes to choose this formulation, being the lack of scientific publications the least valued (12%). These opinions were based on their own clinical experience with TO or on scientific publications, without establishing comparison with other treatment options. The main barriers would be administrative obstacles (84%), difficulty in its use (54%) and the lack/rejection of the transdermal administration by the patient (33%). Actions were proposed to correct the 8 most significant barriers, such as better training for specialists (both Urology and other specialties) and for patients, creating informative materials to reinforce health education in managing patches, generating greater volume of scientific evidence to support their use in overactive bladder and clearly identifying the profile of patients who will benefit most from this therapeutic strategy. CONCLUSIONS Although oxybutynin has been standard treatment of overactive bladder in recent years the conclusion of this working group is that its new transdermal formulation offers a better-tolerated alternative for patients, and, therefore the necessary tools to generate more evidence should be implemented to increase the proper use among specialists and patients.</dc:description>
