<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND No intravenous multivitamin formulation is available at the Chilean market that fulfills the requirements of pediatric patients on total parenteral nutrition. Therefore, adult formulations must be used. AIM To prepare a parenteral aqueous multivitamin solution, to be used in pediatric patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The solution was prepared, mixing vitamins according to their stability and compatibility, in a horizontal laminar flow hood. The quality control for this formulation at times zero and 30 days consisted of an organoleptic analysis, microbiologic and pyrogen controls and vitamin quantification. In addition, the effect of vitamin solution incorporation on the stability of total parenteral nutrition formulae was evaluated. The approximated production cost was calculated. RESULTS The ampoules did not show changes on the organoleptic characteristics. No bacterial contamination or pyrogens were detected. Total parenteral nutrition solutions were not modified after the incorporation of the vitamins. The vitamin solution was stable for one month at 4 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS The manufacture of this formulation results in significant savings, because it has a low manufacturing cost and fulfills pediatric requirements.</dc:description>
