<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Prostate cancer is a common neoplasm, with a significant burden of mortality. Since it's diagnosed at old ages and usually growths slowly, agresive treatment of localised cancer of prostate could be of little benefit. The study of the evolution of incidental prostate cancer diagnosed 20 years ago could give directions for present decision-making. METHODS We performed a time survival analysis of patients diagnosed of incidental prostate cancer between 1980 and 2000, and followed them until april 2005. We analysed overall and disease-specific mortality, related to the kind of treatment and some anatomopathological characteristics. RESULTS We included 80 cases. Treatment was hormonotherapy in 34 cases, surgery in 4, radiotherapy in 3 and watchful waiting in 39. Overall average survival was 8.87 years. Disease-specific survival in low risk group (Gleason lower than 6) was 16 years, and in high risk group (Gleason higher than 7) was 6 years. No differences were found between hormonotherapy and watchful waiting. CONCLUSIONS While in low risk patients watchful waiting represents an acceptable aproaching, it could not be adequate in high risk cases. Hormonotherapy showed no benefit in incidental prostate cancer.</dc:description>
