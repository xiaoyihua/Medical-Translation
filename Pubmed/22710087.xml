<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Shorter length of the right renal vein (RRV) may represent an additional difficulty for transplant. This paper has aimed to present our experience with RRV elongation in the kidney from a cadaveric donor and to compare the results with the rest of kidneys transplanted in the same period of time. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed 377 kidneys transplants within the last 11 years. Of these, in 120, the RRV was elongated with the vena cava. The surgical technique is described and the results compared with the remaining transplants of the series. Renal function, graft survival and complications were assessed at 1, 3 and 12 months. Data were obtained retrospectively from the database of the Urology Department and Hospital medical records. RESULTS In the 377 transplants, there were 4 (1%) venous thrombosis, 2 (1.6%) of which concerned kidneys with elongation of the RRV and 2 (0.7%) in the rest of transplanted kidneys. There was no difference in postoperative bleeding, 11 (9.1%) occurred in kidneys with elongated RRV and 22 (8.5%) in the remaining kidney. In no case was the bleeding related to the elongated segment. Graft survival and renal function were similar for both groups. CONCLUSIONS Elongation of the RRV with the vena cava is a feasible, fast, and effective procedure that does not increase morbidity or affect renal function or graft viability. It facilitates vascular anastomosis and places the kidney in a less forced position, shortens the warm ischemia time and avoids the risk of kinking of the renal artery because it is equal to the length of the vein artery.</dc:description>
