<dc:description xml:lang="en">From March to May 1996 we performed transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus with spring coils in 4 patients. Age ranged from 5 month to 11 years (mean 4.3 years). One of them had two previous Rashkind occluders with persistant shunt and other case had pulmonary valve stenosis, in this case we performed pulmonary valvuloplasty and after that closure of ductus arteriosus. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 10 to 38 mmHg (mean 18), QP/QS was 1.2 to 5.0 (mean 3.2). Immediate total occlusion occurred in two cases and the other had trivial shunt by doppler echocardiography. No complications were detected. In conclusion we believe that this device is another no surgical alternative to treat persistant ductus arteriosus. It is effective, it has a low cost, and all the patients are candidates. The procedure carries minimum risk and has no mortality.</dc:description>
