<dc:description xml:lang="en">In his keynote address to the international seminar of the ALANAM (Association of Latin American National Academies of Medicine), held October 28-30, 2010, in Santiago, Chile, Dr. Alejandro Goic, President of the Chilean Academy of Medicine, discussed the state of health and of medical and health research in Latin American countries. He called attention to the fact that the National Academies of Medicine are learned and honorific institutions whose main function is to reflect on, and foster, medical practice, medical education, and public health. He noted that medical doctors bear a great individual and collective responsibility in the organization and management of sanitary services, but that health care as such concerns all citizens. Poverty is one of the most important factors conditioning the state of health in any society, particularly in developing countries. Because of the very nature of the medical profession, doctors are acquainted not only with the physical and mental ailments that afflict the poor, but also with their precarious housing, income, and labor conditions, as well as with how difficult it is for them to have access to good health care and education. He emphasized that health care is not only a technical, administrative and economic institution, but a moral one as well. When the economic considerations of the health care industry and its financial mechanisms prevail over the medical needs of the general population, a severe social problem arises to the extent that important segments of the population are denied access to health care, and preventable human suffering is left unattended. Society and governments have the responsibility of financing health services and ensure that the humanitarian ends of medicine are met in health care services and sanitary institutions. The superior aim in health care should always be to afford a humane, caring, and respectful relationship between health care professionals and all users of the health care system without exception.</dc:description>
