<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To compare the form of presentation and management of the disease in two surgical units covering geographically different populations. DESIGN Observational retrospective study. PATIENTS AND METHOD 203 cases from the 2nd Chair of Surgery of the Hospital Universitario de Clínicas de Asunción, Paraguay and 150 cases from the Hospital Universitario de Lleida, Spain. We analyzed the cause of admission, medical history, treatment and post-operative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS Paraguay series: average age: 53 years (range 34-84) for men and 62 years (range 36-92) for women. Fifty-five per cent were hospitalized because of hemorrhagic complications and 45% because of acute diverticulitis. Medical treatment was provided in 109 cases and surgery in 110, 72 of which were emergencies and 38 elective procedures (p &lt; 0.05). Morbidity was 31.8% (40.2% in emergencies and 16% in elective procedures, p &lt; 0.05) and mortality was 15.5% (20.2% in emergencies and 2.6% in elective procedures, p &lt; 0.003). LLEIDA SERIES: Average age: 65.5 years (range 38-85, p &lt; 0.01) for men and 71.4 years (range 30-93, p &lt; 0.01) for women. Eighty-six per cent were hospitalized because of acute diverticulitis and 10.7% because of acute hemorrhage (p &lt; 0.001). Sixteen per cent have had previous attacks (p &lt; 0.001). Medical treatment was provided to 111 patients and surgery to 39 (p &lt; 0.001), 33 of which were emergencies and 6 elective procedures (p &lt; 0.04). Morbidity was 41% and mortality 12.8% (5 cases), all of which were emergencies. The surgical technique was similar in both groups: resection with primary anastomosis in elective procedures and Hartmann's procedure in most emergencies, with a rate of immediate anastomosis of 33 and 21%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Factors related to nutrition and quality of life may influence the development of diverticular disease. Emergency surgery should be prevented. Surgeons must adapt their surgical approach to the socioeconomic and cultural medium of the population.</dc:description>
