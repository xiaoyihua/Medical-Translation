<dc:description xml:lang="en">Acting as a direct toxic through different mechanisms, alcohol causes many hormonal changes which induce sexual function impairment and fertility problems. We have used 36 white Wistar Lewis rats, divided in three large groups: 10% alcoholic, 25% alcoholic and control group for 55 and 95 days. The parameters studied were the rat's ponderal evolution, testicular volume and weight, testes and body weights ratio, as well as testes density and seminiferous tubule area. We found a decreased ponderal gain in animals receiving high doses of alcohol. Decreased testicular volume and increased density in long-term alcohol regime. At high dose and medium-term increased testicular weights were seen as compared to total weight of the rat. The area of the seminiferous tubule is reduced in all alcoholic groups.</dc:description>
