<dc:description xml:lang="en">The prognostic factors in 104 patients subjected to pelvic exenterations for cervical cancer recurrent after radiation therapy, at The Oncology Service Hospital General de Mexico, S.S., who survived the surgical procedures with a follow-up for three years or more, are presented here. Results were with statistical significance in the next cases: Patients with 35 years old or less, had a better prognosis when compared with the others: 15/22, 68.1%, vs. 36/82, 43.9%, P = 0.03; clinical reports of tumour localized in cervix, 17/22, 77.2%, vs. infiltration of lateral wall of the pelvis: 11/39, 28.2%, P = 0.008. Pyelographic findings of hydronephrosis or renal exclusion: 2/13, 15.3% vs. normal reports: 9/13, 69.2%, P = 0.01. Infiltration of urinary bladder and or rectal wall: 15/41, 36.5% vs. absence of these: 36/63, 57.1%, P = 0.03; tumour involving myometrium with or without ovarian metastases: 2/15, 13.0% vs. absence of these reports: 49/89, 55.5%, P = 0.03 and the absence of lymph metastatic nodes: 40/68, 58.8% vs. the presence of 3 or more positive lymph nodes: 4/15, 26.6%, P = 0.01. In this series we didn't find differences with statistical significance when compared, the modalities of schemes of radiotherapy, the variety of exenterative procedures and the period of time less or more than a year, between the radiotherapy and the surgery.</dc:description>
