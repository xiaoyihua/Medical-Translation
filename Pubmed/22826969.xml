<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Robotic surgery is a technology that emerged from the fusion and improvement of laparoscopy, robotics and telepresence. All these three technologies underwent a long experimentation process in which several applications and innovations were tested until the only system approved for use in humans was developed: the Da Vinci system by Intuitive Surgical Inc. Gynecology, being one of the pioneer branches of Medicine involved in the development of laparoscopy, is one of the fields with the greatest possibilities for robotics, which offers great diversity of applications in hysterectomies, myomectomies, endometriosis, and in the fields of urogynecology and, most importantly, oncology. There are no publications in Mexico with a proper description of the clinical experience with gynecologic robotic surgery, though a great amount of clinical experience has been accumulated in institutions that already have such equipment. A serious evaluation of the cost-benefit ratio is required because of the high cost of this technology. OBJECTIVE Evaluate and analyze the accumulated experience on this technology of foreign institutions in order to assess the benefits, cost and effectiveness of robotic surgery. CONCLUSION The key to the optimal use of robotic technology is to diminish costs and speed the learning curve, and this implies the entry of other systems into the market as well as institutions with a high volume of patients and determined to invest in a highly trained and skilled surgical team. In order to recommend its implementation in our country an assessment of the efficiency and advantages of robotic technology considering institutional needs is mandatory.</dc:description>
