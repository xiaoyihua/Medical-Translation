<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND We describe our experience of the MVD in the typical trigeminal neuralgia and identify the prognostic factors. METHOD A retrospective studio of 89 cases between 1995-2005 was used. The prognostic significant data evaluated were demographics data; duration of neuralgia; the affected divisions involved; surgical findings; used material for the decompression. The data analysis was made with the chi(2) test. RESULTS We have found an excellent outcome in 77% one year later. The age and the antecedent of hypertension disease were not statistically significant. A poor outcome was observed for: female sex, neuralgia lasting longer than two years, the three divisions involved, venous compression and the muscle used as surgical material. CONCLUSIONS The MVD is an effective and reliable technique. The use of muscle is not recommended. When the three trigeminal divisions are involved we should choose another technique.</dc:description>
