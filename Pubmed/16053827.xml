<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES It has been suggested that high doses of statins can be more effective in reducing the incidence of new cardiovascular events than conventional doses. The present study analyzed the effect of increasing the atorvastatin dose to 80 mg/day on indices of inflammation (C-reactive protein or CRP), thrombogenesis (prothrombin fragment [F1+2]) and fibrinolysis (tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen, t-PA, and its inhibitor PAI-1) in high-risk patients with ischemic heart disease. PATIENTS AND METHOD We studied 27 patients with high-risk coronary heart disease who had lipid levels above those recommended despite treatment with atorvastatin at 40 mg/day. At baseline, patients were compared with 21 normocholesterolemic subjects without arteriosclerotic disease. Twenty-four patients were reevaluated 3 months after the atorvastatin dose was increased to 80 mg/day. RESULTS The CRP, F1+2, t-PA and PAI-1 levels were significantly higher in patients than control subjects (all P&lt;.05). After the atorvastatin dose was increased, significant reductions in CRP, F1+2, and PAI-1 levels were observed (P&lt;.05). There was a significant positive correlation between the reduction in cholesterol level and that in F1+2 (r=0.43; P=.023). No other significant correlations were found. CONCLUSIONS In a group of patient with high-risk heart disease and elevated lipid levels, increasing the atorvastatin dose led to significant improvements in inflammatory, thrombogenic, and hypofibrinolytic states.</dc:description>
