<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE This paper reports data of suicide as a cause of death in Mexico from 1970 to 1994. MATERIAL AND METHODS Death certificates and census data were used as the main sources for this study. RESULTS In 1970 554 suicide deaths were reported for both genders. In 1994 there were 2 603 deaths. During this period the suicide death rate increased from 1.13 per 100 000 inhabitants to 2.89 per 100 000 inhabitants, which represents an increase of 156% in 24 years. Nevertheless, a higher increase was seen among males; 169% for this period as compared to 98% among females. In 1970 the proportional suicide mortality rate was 0.11% of total deaths; in 1994, an increase to 0.62% was observed. During the study period, the highest increase in the suicide rate was seen in the older groups (65 years and over). Nevertheless, an increase was also seen among the younger population (those aged under 19 years). In 1994, the last year of the series, the highest rates were found among males, especially among those aged 65 and over. Differences were found also in the suicide rates among the states of the Mexican Republic. In 1994 the State of Tlaxcala and the State of Mexico reported the lowest rates. The highest rates were found in Tabasco and Campeche. Thus, the highest suicide rates were seen in the southeast and the lowest rates in the central part of the country. CONCLUSIONS Suicide is a growing problem in Mexico, mainly occurring among male older adults. Nevertheless, growing rates among young adults call for suicide prevention and care programs.</dc:description>
