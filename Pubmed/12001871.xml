<dc:description xml:lang="en">Heart failure during the immediate period of an acute myocardial infarction constitutes a major insult to this pathology; since, once installed, it is associate to ventricular dysfunction and expansion of the left ventricle. It can appear either early or delayed. Subsequent to the acute insult, the myocardium is subjected to diverse changes in its anatomical conformation and to diastolic and systolic alterations, which will affect the hemodynamic constants of the patient. Changes in the parietal ventricular architecture as well as at the neurohumoral level will also occur. The clinical signs of heart failure are: dyspnea, pallor, tachycardia, diaphoresis, cold skin, oliguria, somnolence, and gallop, which can be observed at the very beginning of the coronary occlusion. Its clinical identification, through in-hospital studies supported by adequate hemodynamic monitoring, is of utter relevance since it will lead to appropriate and fast treatment. The groups of patients with acute myocardial infarction with high risk for the development of cardiac failure are: patients with extensive Q wave infarction, diabetic, patients over 65 years of age, and those with a history of previous myocardial infarction(s). The cornerstone of treatment must be focused on reducing the myocardial ischemia, which can be achieved through the use of modern therapeutics and, given the case, pharmacological agents, coronary intervention procedures, or cardiac surgery must be taken into account. At present it is known that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, betablockers, inotropics, are useful to improve ventricular function in patients with acute myocardial infarction.</dc:description>
