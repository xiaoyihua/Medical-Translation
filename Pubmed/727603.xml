<dc:description xml:lang="en">Authors revise world bibliography up to 153 cases. As introduction, they study the different anomalies that are presented, making special mention to the frequency of this syndrome, quoting to the statistics of different authors. Familiar antecedents, parents age and the alterations that had been presented in children affected with this process, including considerations not only within race, related by blood and sex, but also those malformations that in an accessorial way were displayed with more frequency have been taken into consideration. Between all the conclusions, it's significative that syndactily appears with more frequency in fatherly antecedents and although this syndrome appears in young parents, it's increases in great proportion as the age of the progenitors advances.</dc:description>
