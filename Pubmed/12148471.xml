<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the ultrasonographic and lipid changes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) according to the type of hormonal treatment. STUDY DESIGN Thirty-two women with clinical and ultrasonographic diagnosis of PCOS were studied and randomly distributed in one or another treatment group. Group I: chlormadinone (2 mg/day for 5 days every month) (n = 16) and Group II: ethinylestradiol 35 micrograms plus desogestrel 150 mg (21 days every month) (n = 16). At baseline and at third month a pelvic ultrasound was done to assess the number and size of follicles, also total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured. RESULTS In both groups a significant decrease was found in the number of follicles in both ovaries, but only in group II there was a significant decrease in follicular size in both ovaries. No differences were found between the groups in the number of follicles or in the final follicular size. In both groups, a significant decrease was found in total cholesterol levels, without changes in triglycerides levels. CONCLUSION Only combined therapy decreased follicular size. So the type of treatment should be based on patient expectations such as sexual activity, or for control of androgen excess.</dc:description>
