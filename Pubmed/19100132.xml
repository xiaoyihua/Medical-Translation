<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Despite its frequency and high clinical burden, few studies have analyzed the clinical features of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a hospital setting. Our purpose was to describe its manifestations and clinical course in a general hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with a diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal since January 1983 to December 2003, according to the revised fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, at the Xeral-Calde General Hospital in Lugo, were studied. Clinical and biochemical data at admission were collected, as well as those referred to the clinical course and complications. RESULTS 539 episodes in 436 patients were included. Mean age was 45 (standard deviation: 12), and 91,3% were men. Abstinence was the reason for admission in 62,3%. 71,1% had a diagnosis of delirium tremens during their stay. Hallucinations were present in 59,7%, and convulsions (most of them generalized) in 41%. Patients with delirium tremens had greater elevations in temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, as well as more convulsions than minor withdrawal cases. Cirrhosis was present in 10%. The admission rate to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was 37,8% (95% confidence interval [95%IC]: 33,1-37,8). Of these, 69,9% needed mechanical ventilation. Mortality rate was 6,6% (95%IC: 4,2-9,1). 62% of patients died after admission in the ICU. CONCLUSION The majority of complications related to the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a hospital setting develop in patients with delirium tremens. They are especially related to the rate of admissions to the ICU and the use of mechanical ventilation.</dc:description>
