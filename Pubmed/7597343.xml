<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this work was to study the prevalence, behavior and opinions towards smoking in a sample of 288 physicians from Santiago, stratified according to sex and specialty. The WHO Europe questionnaire was applied and smoker was defined as the person that consumed one or more cigarettes per day. Thirty six percent of the sample (40.2% of men and 23.8% of women) smoked an average of 9 cigarettes per day, compared to the figure of 28.3% obtained in a similar study in 1983. Fifty percent of smokers felt that they will not quit. No differences in knowledge about problems associated to smoking or forbidding smoking in hospitals, were observed between smokers and non-smokers. A majority of smokers did not smoke in front of their patients and did not allow smoking in their private clinics. It is concluded that, although a high proportion of physicians continue to smoke, their opinions and behavior will support smoking cessation efforts.</dc:description>
