<dc:description xml:lang="en">Home oxygen therapy has been classically based on the use of compressed oxygen cylinders and portable oxygen (O(2)) concentrators. In the last few years, we have witnessed the advent of portable oxygen therapy equipment and liquid oxygen systems and even more recently portable O(2) concentrators. This equipment allows for greater patient mobility, which generates new issues that we must understand and approach adequately. One of these is selecting the best oxygen source for each patient. In doing so, it is necessary to compare the patient mobility profile with the mobility allowed by the O(2) sources in order to determine the degree of correlation between the two. Proper indication for home oxygen therapy, the selection of the right source and the titration of the oxygen flow are three components which we must face when deciding to prescribe home oxygen therapy. The patient must also cooperate with correct O(2) use.</dc:description>
