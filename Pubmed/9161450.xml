<dc:description xml:lang="en">In accordance with the fact the aging process is closely related to the individual nutrition, it is possible to infer that the daily diet could help and improve, to a certain degree, to the elderly well-being. Based on this and making use of the food technology expertise, the development of a low cost, easily prepared and preserved product, in accordance with the taste and needs of the elderly people was considered. The objective of this project was to elaborate an intermediate moisture food (IMF) based on texturized soy protein with carrots, potatoes and peas, adding humectants and microstatic agents according to the moist and dry infusion methods. Fried bacon was added to some formulas in order to evaluate the sensorial preference of the product with and without bacon by elderly people and effect of the bacon on the water activity (aw) reduction. The aw for the product with added bacon was 0.859 and 0.896 for the one with no added bacon. The product with added bacon allowed 20% of the nutritional requirements of the elderly people of protein, vitamin A and thiamine. Both formulas were equally highly accepted by the elderly people (80%) and were microbiologically stable for 8 weeks period at 25 degrees C and 55% RH in aluminium/cellophane/polyethylene and polyester/polyethylene flexible packages. We can conclude that IMF may be an alternative to improve the diet of the elderly people.</dc:description>
