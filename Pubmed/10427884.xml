<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify the prognostic factors for recurrence and disease progression in T1 superficial carcinoma of the bladder for prophylactic therapeutic planning. METHODS Of 309 patients with superficial carcinoma of the bladder that had only undergone TUR, we selected 196 patients that met the following requirements: T1 tumor, one year minimum follow-up (except for recurrence), TUR complete on gross examination. The changes observed with recurrence (presence of a tumor regardless of grade or stage) and disease progression (higher tumor stage and therefore infiltrating) in the following parameters were analyzed: tumor grade, node involvement, volume resected, number of tumors, primary or recurrent and age. RESULTS 141 (72%) showed recurrence and 23 disease progression (11.7%) at two-years' mean follow-up. The resected tumor volume was found to be a prognostic factor for recurrence by univariate (0.010) and multivariate analysis (0.039). Tumor grade (0.0005) and node involvement (0.040) were prognostic factors for disease progression by univariate analysis and tumor grade (0.006) by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Resected tumor volume, node involvement and tumor grade were found to be prognostic factors. The incidence of disease progression in this series falls within the lower ranges reported in the literature.</dc:description>
