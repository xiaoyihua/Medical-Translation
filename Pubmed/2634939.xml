<dc:description xml:lang="en">Seventy-eight patients with calculi in solitary kidney were submitted to treatment with shock waves. The epidemiologic data presented herein include stone volume, localization, and type (29 caliceal, 10 pyelic, and 5 multiple calculi; 13 pseudostaghorn, 11 staghorn, and 10 ureteral calculi). Patient evaluation 3 months after treatment revealed overall good results were achieved: 46 renal units were stone-free and 20 had small stone fragments that could be spontaneously passed. Thirteen patients had persistent residual lithiasis. Different types of complementary endoscopic treatments had been utilized in 65% of the cases. With regard to complications, there were 5 cases with obstructive anuria and 4 with fever. The foregoing results show that ESWL is a safe and effective method of treatment of lithiasis in patients with solitary kidney. It is currently the procedure of choice for this patient group.</dc:description>
