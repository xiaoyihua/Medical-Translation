<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of domestic violence (DV) in adult women attending Primary Care medical consultations, to determine the associated factors, and family physician involvement in its detection. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a cross-sectional analytical study in two urban health districts of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands. A consecutive sample of women aged 18 or older, whether or not they had a current partner were selected.. The Bradley questionnaire, which is validated (26 items) and assesses physical, psychological and sexual violence was used anonymously. Demographic characteristics, and those related to the couple, health history, presence of anxiety and depression (Goldberg scale) were recorded. RESULTS A total of 299 women were interviewed, and 154 women recognised some kind of abuse at least once in their life (51.5%, 95% Cl: 40%-62%). Psychological violence was the most mentioned (n = 153; 99.35%), followed by physical (n = 39; 25.32%) and sexual violence was stated by 12 women (7.79%). Domestic violence was associated with: younger age, less time in a previous relationship, lack of social support (OR=2.18, P=.019), presence of probable anxiety (OR = 1.77, P = .015) and probable depression (OR = 1.58, P = .049). After multivariate analysis the association persisted with the Length of time of the relationship with previous partner (OR = 0.998; P &lt; .0001) and the presence of probable anxiety (OR = 1.79; P = .024). Early detection of domestic violence was recorded in the medical records of 111 women (37.1%; 95% CI: 36.90-37.23). CONCLUSIONS As in other studies, DV is associated with mental disorders, and there is a need for greater involvement by family physicians to detect this prevalent problem in our clinics.</dc:description>
