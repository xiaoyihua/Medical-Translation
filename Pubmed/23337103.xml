<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of obesity and overweight in children and adolescents in our city and to investigate the associated factors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study of 1317 children and adolescents aged 2-16 years. Multistage probability sampling was used to select three groups of subjects: 411 aged 12 to 16 years, 504 aged 6 to 12 years, and 402 aged 2 to 6 years. Body mass index was calculated, and obesity and overweight were diagnosed using the threshold levels of the International Obesity Task Force for children and adolescents. Parents were asked about eating habits, health, social, and demographic aspects. Results are given as percentages (95% confidence interval). The relationship between obesity and overweight and the different variables was studied using multiple logistic regression. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) was calculated. RESULTS Among children and adolescents aged 2-16 years, 9.5% (8.0%-11.0%) were obese and 22.4% (23.3%-24.6%) were overweight. Of subjects aged 12-16 years, 8.5% (5.9%-11.2%) were obese and 20.5% (16.7%-24.3%) were overweight. In the groups aged 6-12 years and 2-6 years, rates of obesity and overweight were 11.6% (8.9% -14.3%) and 31.0% (27.0-35.0) and 8.0% (5.4%-10.6%) and 13.6% (10.3%-16.9%) respectively. Obesity or overweight was associated to age (OR 1.21; P&lt;0.001), maternal obesity (OR 10.99; P= 0.008), a birthweight higher than 4kg (OR 2.91; p 0.002), and formula feeding (OR 1.82; P= 0.005). CONCLUSION Obesity and overweight in children and adolescents are highly prevalent problems in our city.</dc:description>
