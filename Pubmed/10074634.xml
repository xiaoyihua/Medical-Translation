<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Few toxic outbreaks by quails ingestion have been described, none in Spain, and the toxic hasn't been identified. A toxic outbreak, by quails ingestion that ate Galeopsis ladanum seeds, is described and an animal model is developed. PATIENTS AND METHODS A rhabdomyolysis outbreak by quails ingestion is studied clinical and epidemiologically. Quails crops were analyzed and 20 patients were studied. A murine model was developed. Alcaloid content in Galeopsis ladanum seeds and quail meat was measured. RESULTS Twenty patients suffered from rhabdomyolysis (myalgia, increase of muscular enzymes and myoglobinuria) by ingestion of quails that ate Galeopsis ladanum seeds as it could be seen at their crops. Six patients needed hospital care but evolution was benign. Rats fed with quails that ate Galeopsis ladanum seeds had higher creatinkinase (CK) levels than controls rats (near significance, p = 0.0588). Several alcaloids, stachydrine included, was detected in seeds. Another alcaloid no identified was detected in quails meat. CONCLUSIONS Quails that eat Galeopsis ladanum seeds are toxic for human beings, causing rhabdomyolysis. A plant alcaloid could be the toxic involved in the outbreak.</dc:description>
