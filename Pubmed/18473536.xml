<dc:description xml:lang="en">With the aim of testing its effect in the control of ascosphaerosis in bees, the essential oil of ajedra was incorporated into three types of feed in five different concentrations. Syrup (water and honey) with 0.1% were the best tolerated by the bees, with no colonial changes after a single feed. Later, the ascosphaerosis was introduced in a controlled manner into eight hives. For this, a 10 e6/ml spore suspension was applied by nedulisor three times a week for four weeks to ensure its abundant presence inside the hives. This was continued for the next four weeks period, and at the same time portions of brood-comb in a known state (24 h before operculation) were removed from the hives and heat shocked for 24 h (22 -/+ 2 degrees C), then replaced in the hives for their opercultion, finally removing them and maintaining them at 35 degrees C and 70% relative humidity until the appearance of typical disease symptoms (mummification of the larvae).The hives were randomly divided into two groups of four. One group received 500 ml of syrup with 0.1% oil of ajedra, twice a week for four weeks. The other was kept as the control, receiving syrup without medication. 27.6% of the selected larvae in the treated hives showed mummification, compared with 79.1% in the control hives. The treatment was perfectly tolerated by the bee colonies, showing no changes in their subsequent development.</dc:description>
