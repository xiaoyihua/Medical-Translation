<dc:description xml:lang="en">We set out to determine the efficiency of two motivational interventions (brief and intensive) in adolescent smokers, based on obtaining cognitive dissonance and seeking to help them stop smoking. A multicenter randomized experimental study was carried out at five high schools. Individual anti-smoking interventions were applied at the schools, the participants being adolescent smokers (≤ 20 years) who wished to quit smoking. Exclusion criteria were use of anti-smoking drugs, severe psychiatric illness and pregnancy. Informed consent was obtained and a questionnaire recorded demographic variables and alcohol/tobacco/other drug use. Two motivational interventions were carried out at each school by GP, in accordance with a stratified randomization procedure: intensive (four sessions, progressive reduction of smoking) and brief (single session, immediate cessation of smoking). Smoking abstinence was confirmed by co-oximetry at 1, 6 and 12 months after the intervention, with analysis by intention to treat. A total of 92 adolescents participated, with a mean age of 15.4 ± 1.0 years; no differences at the beginning of the interventions: daily smokers accounted for 82% of the sample, with low dependence (62%) and moderate-high motivation to quit smoking (88%). Seventy-eight per cent used alcohol and 21% other drugs. Family functioning and social support were normal in the majority. 47% received the intensive intervention. Abstinence was achieved by 64% ± 5.0 by the first month (20% better in intensive intervention), 42% ± 5.2 by the sixth month and 27% ± 4.6 by the twelfth month (without differences). The brief intervention appears to be more efficient, while more research is needed to determine the profile of those adolescents who would benefit from intensive intervention.</dc:description>
