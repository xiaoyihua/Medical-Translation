<dc:description xml:lang="en">Physiological and pathological processes differ in men and women, depending on factors such as sex and sociological and anthropological characteristics. However, many diseases are still approached from a masculine point of view. In this respect, ischemic heart disease is one of the diseases that most clearly reflects biological differences and social inequalities. In women, the disease presents at a more advanced age, and presentation is frequently atypical with a higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater severity. Consequently, treatment and outcome differ from those in men. Additionally, women differ in their knowledge, and beliefs regarding ischemic heart disease, as well as in their attitudes at symptom onset. Therefore, clinical practice should place significant emphasis on all these aspects in order to avoid inequalities between men and women in the correct diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation of ischemic heart disease.</dc:description>
