<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION There are many studies that analyse preoperative factors with a poor prognosis in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal carcinoma liver metastases, in order to avoid unnecessary surgery. However, there are few studies that evaluate the intraand postoperative prognostic factors. The aim of this study is to analyse pre-, intra- and postoperative prognostic factors in a series of 210 patients undergoing surgery for colorectal carcinoma liver metastases, with special emphasis on the postoperative factors that can give us information on the aggressiveness of the tumour and the curative effectiveness of the surgery. PATIENTS AND METHOD Between September 1996 and December 2006, 210 patients undergoing surgery for colorectal carcinoma liver metastases in whom we analysed pre-, intra- and postoperative factors of survival. Mean follow-up was 55+/-3 months (range: 12-124 months). RESULTS The postoperative mortality rate was 1.4% and the morbidity rate was 22%. Actuarial and disease-free survival at 1-, 3- and 5-years was 89.9% vs 63%, 66.9% vs 32%, and 53.8% vs 23%, respectively. Among the preoperative factors analysed, the age&gt;65 years and LM size&gt;5 cm were independent predictors of poor overall survival, whereas the other two significant factors were obtained from those analysed postoperatively: presence of microsatellitosis and postoperative CEA levels (at 1 and 3 months). CONCLUSIONS In patients with colorectal carcinoma liver metastases we must take into account certain postoperative factors that can give us information on the aggressiveness of the tumour and the effectiveness of the surgery.</dc:description>
