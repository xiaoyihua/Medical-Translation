<dc:description xml:lang="en">Eosinophilic esophagitis is a rare, recently discovered disease, characterized by esophageal symptoms, such as dysphagia and food impaction, associated with dense eosinophilia on endoscopic biopsy of the esophagus. Other entities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease are absent and there is a lack of response to proton pump inhibitor therapy. This disease mainly affects the pediatric population but is becoming more prevalent in adults. There are several theories on the etiopathogenesis of this entity, which may involve allergies and atopy. In advanced disease, complications such as esophageal stenosis can appear. Treatment is based on dietary elimination, corticosteroids and endoscopic dilatation. We report a case of eosinophilic esophagitis with esophageal stenosis.</dc:description>
