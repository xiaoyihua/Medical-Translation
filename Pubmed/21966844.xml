<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In recent years emerged as a primary need, the evaluation of the services offered to get better quality in them. Health systems are subject to these assessments. OBJECTIVE To assess the quality of care provided to patients who underwent hysterectomy, since the reference of the family physician, until discharge by the gynecologist. We analyzed the diagnostic results in the short and long-term, patient satisfaction and gynecologist satisfaction, regarding the conditions for offering services. PATIENTS AND METHOD Retrospective study including 118 patients who underwent hysterectomy and were analyzed the following aspects: history, diagnoses and outcomes. Cross-sectional surveys were also conducted to obtain the satisfaction of patients and the physicians who performed the surgeries. RESULTS The satisfaction of patients was confirmed, in contrast to the opinion of gynecologists who expressed dissatisfaction with the resources they have. There was discrepancy between diagnosis, planned surgery and the procedure performed, however, the clinical results were adequate. CONCLUSIONS At present, any institution should periodically evaluate the services it provides to implement measures and procedures commensurate with their population and resources and invite users to participate in internal decision making and provide the opportunity to become an evaluator to generate a culture of self-improvement and continuous improvement in all involved.</dc:description>
