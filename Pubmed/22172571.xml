<dc:description xml:lang="en">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most prevalent diseases. Its prevalence increases with the age, and causes a high morbidity and mortality in the elderly population. COPD is currently considered as an inflammatory disease characterised by a pulmonary obstruction that is not fully reversible, and is associated with a high comorbidity. The treatment in the elderly does not differ much from that used in young adults, although the high comorbidity, the multiple prescription drugs and the use of different inhalation devices means that treatment has to be adapted to each patient. The presence of exacerbations, inactivity, systemic inflammation and dyspnea leads to a decrease in activity and loss of physical function. In this review we will update the physiology, diagnosis and treatment of COPD in the elderly, and the prevention of geriatric syndromes in this disease.</dc:description>
