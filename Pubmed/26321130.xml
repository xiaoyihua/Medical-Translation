<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Streptococcus pneumoniae is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Children with certain conditions are at risk of developing pneumococcal disease, including invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The aim of this study is to estimate admission rates for IPD in children with risk conditions in Catalonia, and to describe their characteristics. MATERIAL AND METHOD Retrospective longitudinal study of admission rates due to IPD between 2005 and 2012 in children younger than 16 years referred by Primary Care Centres of the Catalan Institute of Health, with risk conditions for invasive pneumococcal disease. Information was obtained from electronic medical records in the Primary Care Centres and from the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) of acute hospital admissions. RESULTS The overall IPD hospital admission rate in children with underlying conditions was 43.1 cases per 100,000 persons-year (95% CI: 32.2-57.7). The rate was higher in children &lt;2 years old (107.8 per 100,000 persons-year; 95% CI: 69-168.3), and in those with neuromuscular disease and/or cerebrospinal fluid leak (141.6 per 100,000 persons-year), and Down's syndrome (133.5 per 100,000 persons-year). CONCLUSIONS The hospital admission rate due to IPD in children with risk conditions in Catalonia is similar to that observed in other series, and higher than that described in the general population. It is necessary to implement immunisation strategies aimed directly at these risk groups.</dc:description>
