<dc:description xml:lang="es">Background: In the spring of 2009 the emergence of new influenza virus (H1N1) 2009 caused widespread alarm. The objective of this study is to describe the knowledge and risk perceptions towards the disease and its vaccine and the preventive measures adopted by the population. Methods:Atelephone survey was conducted in two rounds with quotas for age, sex, Autonomous Regions and size of municipality. Respondents were asked regarding perceptions, preventive measures, vaccination related to 2009 influenza (H1N1) 2009 and sociodemographic data. Proportional quota sampling based on age, sex, province and size of municipality was used.We performed a descriptive analysis of the main study variables and applied the chi-square test to study the statistical analysis for categorical data Results: Overall we obtained 1,627 valid responses. 823 (51,6%) were women, 502 (30.9%) were between 18 and 34 years old and 580 (35.6%) were between 35 and 55 years old. 729 (49,1%) were unskilled, manual workers, and 857 (52,7%) were living in cities larger than 50,000 inhabitants. Only 15,7 % declared to feel at risk to get influenza, and this proportion was much lower (3,9%) in the second wave, after the epidemic peak.. Overall, more than 80% (n=1353) felt that unnecessary social alarm had been generated (n=1353). 1.253 (77%) of the participants adopted at least one preventive measure. Respiratory hygiene (n=951 58,5%) and hand washing (n= 624 38,4%). were the most common preventive measures adopted. Conclusions: The main adopted measures were those recommended by the government(AU)</dc:description>
