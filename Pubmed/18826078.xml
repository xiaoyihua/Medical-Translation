<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the degree of delayed skeletal maturity in patients with active Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (LCPD) with radiographic evaluation of bone age and the degree of fragmentation of the femoral head using the modified lateral pillar Herring classification. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty patients with LCPD were studied with left hand and wrist anteroposterior simple X- rays to determine bone vs. chronologic age. They were also studied with anteroposterior pelvis simple X-rays to determine the modified lateral pillar Herring classification. RESULTS Seventeen (17/20) patients with LCPD presented with chronologic mean age of 8.15-years-old in comparison to mean bone age of 6.62-years-old (delay in bone age of 22.89 months). We found a delay in bone age; mean of 28 months in children 6 to 10-years-old, mean of 8 months in children 10 years and older by quadratic regression. DISCUSSION Previous series report patients with LCPD delayed bone age of 22 months. Our report present a series with delayed in bone age of a mean of 28 months, in children with LCPD of 6- 10-years-old. CONCLUSIONS The degree of delayed bone age in LCPD, in our Mexican population is of 28 months in children 6- 10-years-old, and only 8 months in children ten-years-old.</dc:description>
