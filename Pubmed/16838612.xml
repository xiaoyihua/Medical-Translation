<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Since the beginning of the application of the RVU treatment, the use of the ultrasound was used taking into account two main indications/symptoms: a) identification of the complications; b) assessment of the result (visualization of the implanted material and the presence of the "uretheral jet" by means or through/of ecodoppler-color). OBJECTIVE To determine the value of the ultrasound in the assessment of the result of the endoscopic treatment of the RVU and in the detection of its complications. MATERIAL AND METHOD From 2001-2002 we have carried out the endoscopic treatment to an overall of 261 ureteral units of all degree and etiology. 246 were assessed post-operation with an ultrasound per month and all of them were evaluated with a cistography after 3 months. In a random sample of 92 units, the result of the isotopic cistography has been compared with the visualization of the implanted material in the bladder; and in a random sample of 56 units, the result of the isotopic cistography has been compared with the presence of ureteral jet in the study with ecodoppler-color after moisturizing of the patient. In order to do, we have done two corresponding comparative charts 2 x 2 and we have calculated the Sensibility and Specificity of the tests, as well as their predictive positive and negative values, the degree of similarity of both tests with the Kappa index, and the degree of statistical relevance with Chi squared. RESULTS The ultrasound did not show significant changes if compared to previous studies in 213 units (86,58 %) although in 5 patients an ectasia has been identified as attributed to the treatment. 3 of this patients have developed renoureteral pain, and in 2 pain has spontaneously disappeared as shown in later tests. The S and the E of the presence of implanted material is 94% and 10%respectively and its VPP and VPN of 80% and 10% and estadistical. The S and E of the jet visualization is 82% and 30%, with a VPP of 84% and a VPN of 27%, a level of statistical relevance of 0.836 and a degree of correlation of 0.121. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound is not a useful technique in the assessment of the result of the endoscopic treatment of the RVU. The role it plays in the assessment of complications is a small one and its use is only indicated to confirm the suspicion of ectasia in those patients that present renoureteral pain.</dc:description>
