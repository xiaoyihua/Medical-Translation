<dc:description xml:lang="en">We intended to estimate D.G.R. in patients suffering from GU, and CG, comparing them with healthy controls. 70 patients, divided in 3 groups, were studied; Group A (Control): 14 cases, Group B (GU) type I Johnson: 11 cases, type III Johnson: 20 cases; Group C (CG): 25 cases (11 antral and 14 antral and fundic). The following studies were performed in all of them upper digestive tract X-ray and fibro-endoscopy with multiple antral and fundic biopsies. Tc 99 HIDA 2 ml. Cu. I.V. was used as radioactive compound, and in the first hour 0.3 ml Cu. in 100 cc of water was administered orally, so as to confirm gastric topography. All patients were studied for 2 hour. Quantitative assessment of D.G.R. was expressed in % related to the hepatobiliary area. D.G.R. was detected in 7.1% of patients in Group A: 54.5% of GU type I and 70% in GU type III. In antral CG a 72.7% of D.G.R. was observed and in antral and fundic CG a 87.6% was found. The differences were significant in all the cases. D.G.R. MAGNITUDE, expressed as geometric mean, was: for Group A: 0.73%; for Group B: Ulcer type I: 6.26% and type III: 6.26%, for Group C: 6.78% in antral gastritis and 11.41% in antral and fundic gastritis.</dc:description>
