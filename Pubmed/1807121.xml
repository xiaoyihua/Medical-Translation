<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thirty patients diagnosed with non-metastatic infiltrating vesical cancer (pT2-3, NoMo) due to receive radical cystectomy and transintestinal urinary by-pass, underwent Pre-operative Nutritional Assessment (PRNA), Cystectomy, post-operative Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), and Post-operative Nutritional Assessment (PONA) in day 7. The purposes of this prospective, uncontrolled clinical trial were: to identify, prior to surgery, undernourished patients, to assess the effectiveness of post-operative TPN with regard to a decrease in morbidity and mortality, and to evaluate the influence of a deficient nutritional condition in the occurrence of post-operative complications. It was found the 16.6% patients were undernourished prior to surgery, 80% of which showed complications, while only 28% patients considered to be in a normal state of nutrition had complications (there were no fistulae, intraabdominal abscesses, and abdominal sepsis). 6.6% complications were TPN-related. The conclusions were: the percentage of patients with malnutrition prior to surgery is large enough to justify a routine PRNA; TPN decreases morbidity and mortality in patients with previous good nutritional state but not in those with malnutrition; undernourished patients have a very high rate of complications and surgery should be delayed until a acceptable state of nutrition is achieved.</dc:description>
