<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Following the line of our earlier investigations, we made an open pilot study using a polysomnograph to objectively show the efficacy of Ropinirole in the treatment of chronic insomnia secondary to the restless legs syndrome (RLS). PATIENTS AND METHODS We did polysomnograph studies on 5 patients with the characteristics of primary RLS, according to the criteria of the International Group for the study of RLS, who had had chronic insomnia for over 5 years. We used Spiegel's questionnaires to show subjective improvement. RESULTS The following parameters were significant between the first night (without treatment) and the second night (with 0.25 mg of Ropinirole) and between night 30 without (treatment) and night 31 (with 0.25 mg of Ropinirole). The results were expressed as average values for the 5 patients with their respective standard deviations. Efficiency of sleep: 62.62% +/- 11.31 as compared with 82.82% +/- 8.80, p = 0.010. After 30 days: 64.88% +/- 17.17 against 88.75% +/- 2.09, p = 0.014. Total time asleep: 295' +/- 51.76 against 397.7 +/- 38.50, p = 0.006. After 30 days: 294.6' +/- 87.40 against 391' +/- 22.38, p = 0.025. Number of periodic movements: 91 +/- 33.59 against 30.8 +/- 35.56, p = 0.011. After 30 days: 189.8 +/- 99.79 against 36.2 +/- 21.56, p = 0.013. All patients had subjective improvement in the parameters of Spiegel's test (p = 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS The improvement in efficiency of sleep seen on polisomnography, total time slept and reduction in periodic limb movements were statistically significant. The subjective improvement described was also confirmed by Spiegel's questionnaire.</dc:description>
