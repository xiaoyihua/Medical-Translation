<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hyperganglionosis or neuronal intestinal dysplasias (NID) and hypoganglionosis (HO) are intestinal diseases of difficult diagnosis and treatment and diverse evolution, despite identical histologic findings. The aim of this study was to discuss the therapeutic problems derived from the patients differing clinical course. Retrospective review of 14 patients with regard to diagnosis, manometry and histology (hematoxylin-eosin, acetylcholinesterase activity, immunohistochemistry and Smith's silver stain) was done. Six patients presented intestinal occlusion or sub-occlusion from the first months of life with impeded oral feeding. Ileostomy was performed in 5 and total colectomy with anastomosis in 1. All patients required parenteral nutrition; cisapride was added in 2. Three died from sepsis (3 NID). Of the 3 survivors, 2 have ileostomies (2 NID) and the other ileo-rectal anastomosis (NID). Of the remaining patients, two presented aganglionism and the finding of proximal hyperganglionism occurred post-surgery. Surgery was repeated in one patient. The remaining 6 (1 HO, 5 NID) were diagnosed between 3 and 10 years of age because of constipation. Four are under treatment with cisapride and 2 required partial colic resection. No relationship can be established between histologic findings and clinical manifestations. In chronic clinical courses, treatment with cisapride and cleaning enemas should be tried first. Acute clinical pictures (occlusion-sub occlusion) should be treated by decompressive ileostomy. Partial colic resection may lead to new intestinal failure.</dc:description>
