<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cardiovascular responses to several agents should be modified by glucocorticoid administration in the rat. We investigate the response to adrenergic agonists such as phenylephrine, noradrenaline, clonidine and isoproterenol and ganglionic blocking agent such as hexamethonium in conscious rats treated during 7 days with dexamethasone. Wistar rats were treated with either Dex (150 micrograms daily x 7 days, p.o.) or water. Mean arterial pressure were calculated from the intraarterial recordings of blood pressure. No differences in basal mean arterial pressure were seen between dexamethasone and control groups of rats. Phenylephrine and noradrenaline showed a pressor effect in control rats that was reduced by dexamethasone treatment. Clonidine showed similar pressor effect in both groups of rats but ten minutes after drug administration, a light hypotension was seen in dexamethasone rats. Isoproterenol and hexamethonium showed a similar hypotensive effect on control and dexamethasone rats. In conclusion, dexamethasone treatment should reduce the pressor responses to phenylephrine and noradrenaline. Moreover, the alpha adrenergic agonist clonidine showed a hypotensive effect in dexamethasone treated rats, although the response of isoproterenol and hexamethonium remains unchanged.</dc:description>
