<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia in clinical practice and has important prognostic implications. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the validity and the reliability of taking the arterial pulse (TAP) in patients over 65 years for detecting in AF and other rhythm disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS A descriptive, observational, multicentre study to validate a diagnostic test within in a controlled clinical trial. SETTING 39 Primary Care Centres in the Spanish National Health Service. A total of 318 physicians and nurses took part in the analysis of validity, and 166 of them took part in the analysis of reliability. The professionals were previously called to a meeting in which they took the arterial pulses, and were given 4 ECGs to interpret. The participants TAP of 864 patients followed by an ECG to confirm the cardiac rhythm. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were estimated to assess the criterial validity and the simple concordance index to check reproducibility. RESULTS The sensitivity of pulse measurement for detecting AF detection was 99.4% (95% CI: 97.9-100.0), with a specificity of 30.7% (95% CI: 26.1-35.3), a positive predictive value of 36.6% (95% CI 32.0-41.2), and negative predictive value of 99.2% (97.3-100.0). The simple concordance between the researchers and the cardiologist for the ECG diagnosis of AF ranged between 84.9% and 91.6%. CONCLUSIONS The TAP has a high sensitivity but a low specificity to detect AF. It is a reliable test for the opportunistic screening of arrhythmias in patients aged over 65 years.</dc:description>
