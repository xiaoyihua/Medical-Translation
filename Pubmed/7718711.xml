<dc:description xml:lang="en">A retrospective anatomoclinic study of 29 cases of miliary tuberculosis, selected from 2.808 necropsies carried out at Hospital Central de Asturias between 1971 and 1994, is described. Fifty eight per cent of the patients were older than 50 years. Predisposing factors were identified in 80%: diabetes, alcoholism, chronic hepatopaty, silicosis, chronic renal failure, immunessupresive treatment and malignant neoplasms. A premorten correct clinical diagnosis were done in 8 cases (27.5%) and were suspected in 4 (13.7%). Typical miliary radiologic pattern was established in 17%. The more frequently affected organs were lungs (100%), liver (82%), spleen (75%), lymphatic nodes (55%) and bone marrow (41%). Early diagnosis and treatment is nowadays more difficult because of increasing of cryptic tuberculosis, involvement of resistant organs (pancreas), new predisposing factors (chronic renal failure), new risk groups (AIDS) and lack of demonstrative clinical and radiologic findings, so is necessary to maintain suspect of this disease always in mind.</dc:description>
