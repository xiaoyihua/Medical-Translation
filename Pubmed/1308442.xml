<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS To find out the personal characteristics of patients who receive intra-muscular medication. To examine those illnesses where this treatment is used. To compare the number of intra-muscular treatments prescribed with the nature of the medication, according to a model of Primary Care and to the doctors training. DESIGN We are dealing with an observational study, in which a questionnaire was used to find patients' characteristics and the prescription given. SITE. The present study was carried out in the Ibiza Health Centre and two old-fashioned out-patient clinics in our Health Area. PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS The population under study consisted of all those patients above the age of 7 who received intramuscular treatment during the period of the study (October, November and December, 1990). INTERVENTIONS There were no interventions, as this was an observational study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN FINDINGS The intra-muscular method of administration was used more in women, people over 50 and those with a very low cultural level. The majority of patients (59.66%) believed that this method was superior to enteric treatments. This method was more often used in out-patient clinics than in the Health Centre (p &lt; 0.01). In the Health Centre less medication treating the Locomotive System (p &lt; 0.001) and more dealing with the Centre Nervous System (p &lt; 0.02) was prescribed. In out-patient clinics more antibiotics, either in combination with each other or with other products, were prescribed (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In the Health Centre the intra-muscular method was used less. Additionally, a smaller proportion of the medication given was intrinsically useless or of unacceptably low value.</dc:description>
