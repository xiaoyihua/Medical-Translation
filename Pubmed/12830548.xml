<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mucinous adenocarcinoma is a rare entity within the group of primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder which represent 0.5-2% of all malignant epithelial bladder tumours. In spite of the rarity of this tumoral type; it is a poor prognosis entity mainly due to its diagnosis especially in advanced stage of the disease. There is no general agreement on the treatment of adenocarcinoma of bladder. Not withstanding surgery would be the only curative treatment, although unfortunately, it is curative in just a few cases. We report six cases with mucinous adenocarcinoma of the bladder attended in our Department in the last ten years (january 1991-december 2001). In one of them a radical cystectomy was performed, while transurethral resection with or without adjuvant treatment was practiced in the other one. Only one patient is alive today, namely, the one where the tumour not invade the muscular tissue. These findings show the discouraging results of this entity closely intertwined with the pathologic stage.</dc:description>
