<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The existence of factors susceptible to modification which have a bearing upon the seric concentrations of cholesterol and other lipids linked to the appearance of arteriosclerosis and coronary cardiopathy, make it advisable to study their impact in the Autonomous Community of Extremadura as a first step towards programming strategies for community measures. METHOD A cross-section study was carried out on a random sampling of 1,060 people grouped by age and blood pressure, detecting the total concentration of cholesterol, HDL-C and triglycerides, on the one hand, and on the other the existing correlations of the variables; amount of alcohol and cigarettes consumed, obesity and overweight. RESULTS The prevalence of hypercholesteremia (more than 240 mg/dl) is significantly higher in people with an index or corporal mass (ICM) greater than 25 (47% and 30%) among those with normal blood pressure. There is also a relationship between high cholesterol levels and excessive ingestion of alcohol and tobacco smoking in this group, with values of 59% in heavy drinkers and 46.7% in non-drinkers and an OR of 2. IC 95% (1.32-3.03). The relationship between the smoking habit and hypercholesteremia is also maintained among moderate smokers and those who smoke more than 20 cigarettes/day. OR = 2.83, IC 95% (1.19-6.7). An inverse relationship is detected between tobacco smoking and the level of HDL-C. CONCLUSIONS The correlation found between the variables included in this study and hypercholesteremia, and its significance, suggests the potential benefits that the modification of these habits through community measures would have for the Community, as part of the primary assistance within a programme for prevention of cardiovascular diseases.</dc:description>
