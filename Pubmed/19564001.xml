<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the setting up of a clinical risk management unit (CRMU) within primary care management, as well as the aims of the project, its implementation phases and the assessment of the results after one year of experience. METHODS A safety plan was prepared, based on the European Excellence Model (EFQM), to establish a strategic working framework. The plan included 38 proposed actions, associated with criteria elements and 26 indicators to evaluate the selected criteria. RESULTS A total of 82% of the anticipated actions were implemented in 2007, which included, actions related to teaching and training (15 activities with 237 trainees), spreading of information associated with patient safety, incident analysis (14) and the introduction of specific safe practices (12). Four of those were considered as "generalisable" safe practices and were spread to the rest of the CRMUs in the Autonomous Region of Madrid. The CRMUs have introduced and monitored three processes related to patient safety, participated in a formal programme on the polymedicated elderly, with good results in cover and quality of the indicators. A primary care team (PCT) from the area took part in the first study carried out in Spain on adverse effects in primary care (APEAS Study). CONCLUSIONS The CRMU can give impetus to strategic lines of safety. The preparation of a strategy defining specific aims has helped in the introduction of patient safety activities and along with the proposed indicators enables the impact of the intervention to be assessed.</dc:description>
