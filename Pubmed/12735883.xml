<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to describe an outbreak of plantar warts and to analyse the risk factors wich determining the transmission. DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. SETTING A school of Alicante. PARTICIPANTS 1,620 students. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Description and analysis of the outbreak. We studied the magnitude and the association between risk factors (sports activities and hygiene habits) and disease by logistic regression model. We estimated the crudes and adjusted odds ratio (OR) and the confidence intervals (CI) of 95%. We carry out environmental study and active search of cases. The global rate of answer to the cross-secctional survey was 70.86%. Reported cases were 221, the global attack rate was 19.25%. The outbreak occurred over 16 months. We did not find statistical significal difference either by sex (P=.138) or age (P=.233). The hygiene conditions of the swimming pool and the changing room were adapted. The risk of disease increased with the number of activities taking place (P=.001). The OR adjusted for hygiene habits was: use of changing room 0.95 (95% CI, 0.38%-2.41%), use of shower rooms 1.06 (95% CI, 0.70%-1.62%), walking barefoot in the changing room 1.97 (95% CI, 1.39%-2.79%) and showering barefoot 0.97 (95% CI, 0.58%-1.64%). CONCLUSIONS Outbreak of person to person transmission, the floor of the changing rooms was the prime cause of transmission. We did not find any association between the use of public swimming pool and the disease</dc:description>
