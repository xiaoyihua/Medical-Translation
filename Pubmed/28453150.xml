<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective To compare the perceptions about HIV/AIDS of homosexual and bisexual Colombian males who live in the Colombian "Eje Cafetero" (Coffee Zone) and of those who migrated to Spain, in order to investigate whether those perceptions have an influence on the social vulnerability of the groups involved, which is determined by aspects such as inequalities that may emerge from ignorance about cultural and sexual diversity of the people who are undergoing a migratory process. Methods This research has a transnational character and was carried out by way of in-depth interviews of adult males living in the autonomous communities of Madrid, Valencia, Cataluña and Andalucía in Spain, and in the departments of Caldas, Quindío, Risaralda and Valle del Cauca in Colombia between 2011 and 2013. In total, 87 interviews were performed in both countries. Conclusion The relationship between migration and sexuality must be contemplated from a comprehensive viewpoint that enriches understanding both of the society of origin as well as of the welcoming country through a consideration of social and cultural aspects. Any health promotion and prevention program expecting to have an influence on social aspects must take into account people's particularities in order to avoid generalizations and their exploitation, recognizing them and making them visible as individuals with full rights who express opinions, speak and participatevisible as whole right individuals, who express opinions, speak and participate.</dc:description>
