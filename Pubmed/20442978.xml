<dc:description xml:lang="en">The implementation of the European Higher Education Area, (EEES in Spanish) inspired in the Bologna Declaration, pursues the introduction of new teaching and learning paradigms which require deep changes in the frame of superior education and university goals. However, in spite that the main purpose of the EEES is convergence and harmonization of curricula contents and titles throughout Europe in order to facilitate circulation of students and professionals, this goal is far from been reached when we are approaching the deadline for its implementation (year 2010). In addition, this process has led to reduce the total duration of the majority of degrees excepting for medicine and few more. In this article we analyze the underdevelopment of the so called Bologna Process in medical education as compared to other careers. Implementation of curricular innovations seems particularly restrained or threatened in Spain because of legal improvisation, lack of funding, and the chronic apathy of national bodies in medical education. As a consequence, and in contrast with other European countries where deep curricular changes have been already arranged, the majority of Spanish Faculties are at risk of introducing little more than cosmetic modifications in their medicine curricula.</dc:description>
