<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE In the last decades there has been an increasing interest in the manipulation of intestinal microbiota with probiotics for the prevention and treatment of certain paediatric diseases. In addition, it has been suggested that probiotics could play a role in the development of immune system. Recent studies suggest that the administration of two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT5711 and Lactobacillus gasseri CECT5714 improves intestinal function of healthy adults and enhances the immune response. Since there are few studies reporting the use of probiotic in children, the main consumers of these products, the aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of the administration of the mentioned probiotic strains in healthy children. INTERVENTIONS 30 children (age range 3-12) with no gastrointestinal pathology were included in the study. In addition to their usual diet, during the first 3 weeks they received 200 ml of a conventional yogurt containing Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. During the following three weeks this yogurt was substi-tuted for 80 ml of a probiotic product (Max Defensas, Puleva Food S.L.) containing the same amounts of Streptococcus thermophilus and the L. bulgaricus was substituted by a mixture of the target probiotic strains: L. coryniformis CECT5711 and L. gasseri CECT5714. Samples of faeces and saliva were taken at the beginning of the protocol, at week 3 and at the end of the study. Intestinal microbiota, faecal citotoxicity and the inhibition of Salmonella cholerasusis ssp. cholerasuis adhesion to intestinal mucins by the faeces were analyzed. Finally, IgA concentration was determined in the faecal and saliva samples. RESULTS Tolerance of the probiotic product was good in all the children included in the study. An increase in faecal lactobacilli counts was shown at the end of the experimental protocol (P &lt; 0,05). In addition citotoxicity of faecal samples was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced after probiotic consumption. The inhibition of S. cholerasuis adhesion to intestinal mucins was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) for faecal waters from children in week 6 compared to samples form week 0 and 3. Probiotic consumption was also shown to increase IgA concentration in faeces and saliva (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The consumption of a probiotic product containing L. coryniformis CECT5711 and L. gasseri CECT5714 improves intestinal flora of healthy children, enhancing the defence against gastrointestinal aggressions and infections both by inhibiting pathogen adhesion to intestinal mucins and enhancing the immune function.</dc:description>
