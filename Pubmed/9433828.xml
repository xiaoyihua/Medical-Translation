<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this study, the serum, urinary, hepatic and renal levels of total inorganic phosphorus (Pi) were determined in guinea pigs treated with 100,000 U.I. of vitamin A, dissolved in Tween Span, given each day by intramuscular injections during seven days (treated group), and compared with the levels in healthy guinea pigs which were given the same feed as the treated group, and received the same amount of Tween Span (control group). The activity of the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase was simultaneously determined in liver and kidneys of both groups, and the phospholipid content in serum and tissue was also determined. The treated group did not show changes in serum and urinary phosphorus as compared with the control group. Liver and kidney of the treated group showed an increase in total Pi (p &lt; 0.05). In this group a definite increase (p &lt; 0.05) was also observed both in serum and tissue levels of phospholipids, as well as in the activity of the liver and kidney enzymes studied. These results suggest that phosphorus enters the blood stream in the form of lipid complexes (phospholipids) that are involved in certain characteristic functions.</dc:description>
