<dc:description xml:lang="en">Clostridium difficile has been recognized as the most important enteric pathogen of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in adults from industrialized countries. The importance of C. difficile as a cause of diarrhea in ambulatory patients appears underestimated or under-recognized. Since the 1980's, outbreaks of CDAD have been increasingly reported, but there are few data available in Argentina. We developed a retrospective study to provide some information about CDAD in our country. From July 1998 to November 1999, a total of 245 fecal specimens from hospitalized and some ambulatory patients were tested in order to confirm the diagnosis of CDAD. C. difficile cytotoxin (toxin B) was identified by detecting its cytopathic effect on monolayers of McCoy culture cells. For culture and isolation of C. difficile, stool samples were prepared by ethanol shock prior to plating onto a selective medium which contained blood, cefoxitin and fructose. Of the 245 samples, 14 (5.8%) were identified as positive by the cell cytotoxicity assay. Using the criteria of isolation of cytotoxigenic C. difficile positivity increased to 6.5% (16 samples). Thirteen of the positive results were from hospitalized patients (81.3%) and 3 (18.7%) from outpatients. The mean age of inpatients was 72.9 years (ranging from 47 to 88). All patients had received 2 or more antimicrobial agents (most of them beta-lactams) 2 months before the appearance of diarrhea. There was one patient who had received only chemotherapy. The prevalence of CDAD in this study was less than in others previously reported. This difference may be due to the fact that not all general practitioners include testing for C. difficile when the patient with diarrhea had previously received antibiotics. More educational programs should be directed to all physicians, concerning the role of C. difficile as an important enteric pathogen in patients who have undergone treatment with antimicrobial or chemotherapeutic agents.</dc:description>
