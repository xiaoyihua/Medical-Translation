<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Paratesticular liposarcomas are rare; most published cases are single cases. We report the clinical, histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of three cases of paratesticular liposarcomas. METHODS We performed clinical, histological and immunohistochemical studies with expression of ki 67 and p 53 markers in three cases of tumors of the spermatic cord. RESULTS Patient age ranged from 36 to 67 years, with a mean of 54 years. All tumors were big, multinodular and predominant histological type was well-differentiated (2/3), being one case undifferentiated (1/3). All cases were treated by surgical excision; one of them had a relapse five years later (33%) as a low-grade undifferentiated liposarcoma. None of the patients have developed metastases after a long follow-up (10, 7, and 5 yr.). CONCLUSIONS Paratesticular liposarcomas have favourable prognostic markers (histological type, low proliferation index Ki 67 and p 53). The evaluation of this masses should be based on imaging tests, but a biopsy is necessary to determine their nature both in the case of primary tumors and recurrences. Surgical treatment should include complete excision with free margins to avoid recurrences.</dc:description>
