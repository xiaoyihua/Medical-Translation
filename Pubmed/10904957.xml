<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION At the end of the 1970s people considered the possibility that transplants might be useful to replace degenerate specific cell populations, such as the mesencephalic dopaminergic neurones in Parkinson's disease (PD). Since then this has become an experimental alternative treatment for patients with degenerative diseases. The history of transplants of catecholamine producing tissues within the brain of patients with PD started in 1985, when Backlund et al published the results of the first implants of autologous adrenal medulla in two patients with Parkinsonism. Since then, many patients throughout the world have benefited from the results obtained using this method. Two main types of tissue have been used in this method: autologous adrenal medulla and human foetal ventral mesencephalic tissue. DEVELOPMENT In this paper we first review the clinical effects of the diverse types of transplant done to date. Then in the second part we give a summary of the clinical results obtained by our group with the different types of transplant carried out. We explain their evolution, original hypothesis and justify the reasons which led us to use three different types of donor material: autologous adrenal medulla, fetal tissue and adrenal medulla co-incubated with peripheral nerve. Then, after showing that the clinical improvement is different depending on the type of tissue transplanted, we comment on the probable reason for the improvement seen in patients with implants. CONCLUSION The transplantation of nervous tissue seems to us to be no longer an experimental alternative for the treatment of PD but has become an effective, lasting treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease.</dc:description>
