<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To know the relation between the usual physical activity pattern and metabolic control and cardiovascular risk factors of people with diabetes mellitus. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 144 type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetic subjects (M/F, 70/74) and 193 type 2 (non insulin dependent) diabetic patients 8M/F, 81/112) fron DNCT study (Diabetes Nutrition and Complications Trial) were included in the study from May 1993 to December 1994. Physical activity index was assessed by means of the weekly caloric expenditure based upon previously published questionnaire. RESULTS At least 60% of diabetic patients had a regular exercise more than 3 times per week. Unexpected, level of HbA1c, but not other parameters, was related to the level of physical activity, in that the higher the activity the higher HbA1c level in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS In the DNCT study the higher physical activity level was associated a worsening in the HbA1c level. These un expected date there are take into account when recommending physical activity to people with diabetes mellitus with no good metabolic control.</dc:description>
