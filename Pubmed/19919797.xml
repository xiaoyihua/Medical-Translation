<dc:description xml:lang="en">Transitions from normal cell to neoplastic malignant cell type require multiple alterations in cell signalling pathways. Transduction and transmission of these signalling pathways are dependent on integrated molecular circuits. A paramount aspect in cancer development is the concept that the cell loses its ability to detect and respond to extracellular signals and frequently develops autocrine signals for overcoming normal physiological controls. Therefore, we analyzed the current concepts of general principles in physiological and some oncogenic cell signalling pathway patterns. We carried out a documentary review of 29 scientific items in which we identified intracellular signalling pathway systems in each cell so complex due to the high number of participants and the multiple differences among specific cell types. The knowledge and identification of general principles regarding the whole physiological cell signaling pathway patterns help us to understand the oncogenic signaling pathways. Identification of these pathways in any tumor can be used as prognosis or predictor biomarkers in the patient's outcome or as target in clinical therapeutic trials.</dc:description>
