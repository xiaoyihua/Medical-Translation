<dc:description xml:lang="en">Plans for a vaccination campaign among the health care personnel at the "Valle del Nalón" Hospital are discussed. For this purpose, first of all, the serological testing to determine the markers as compared to the VHB was done using the ELISA technique, and in following, the vaccine based on genetic engineering, ENGERIX BR was provided, initially according to the criteria established to this effect by law, and then from a less restricted view, according to the principles which are given in the text. We have observed that 14.74% of the workers in our town have some positive marker priori to the vaccination and that 1.81% are carriers. The level of tolerance was that of 45.79%, said level being related to the professional group in question and the service in which they work, differences obtained in both cases being statistically quite significant (p less than 0.0001).</dc:description>
