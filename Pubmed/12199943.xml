<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Some ethnic groups are thought to have greater resistance to disease. However, scientific studies of this phenomenon are lacking in our environment. OBJECTIVE To study hospitalization rates and type of disease among infants according to ethnic group. MATERIAL AND METHODS In 2000, 496 infants aged between 1 and 24 months were admitted to our hospital. Using ethnic group as a variable, 403 infants (81.25 %) were classified as non-gypsy and 93 (18.75 %) as gypsy. Demographic data were used to compare the variables of ethnicity and the main diagnostic group. Descriptive statistical analysis of the variables was performed. Differences were considered significant when p &lt; 0.05. RESULTS The gypsy group represented 6.51 % of the infant population but accounted for 18.75 % of infant admissions (p &lt; 0.05). The gypsy group accounted for 54.83 % of readmissions compared with 20.80 % in the non-gypsy group (p &lt; 0.001). Respiratory disease was more prevalent in the gypsy group (35.48 %) than in the non-gypsy group (22.58 %) (p &lt; 0.05). However, digestive problems were more frequent in the non-gypsy group (34.73 %) than in the gypsy group (19.35 %) (p &lt; 0.05). No statistically significant differences were found in other diagnostic groups. CONCLUSION The differences observed between demographic distribution and admission rate contradict the belief that members of the gypsy ethnic group show greater disease resistance. The differences in admission rate and diagnostic group may be due to socioeconomic, hygienic, health and educational differences between both groups. Differences in the prevalence of respiratory disease were probably due to overcrowding. Gypsy lifestyle in our population does not confer greater disease resistance.</dc:description>
