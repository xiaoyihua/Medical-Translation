<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of the present study was to characterize P. aeruginosa strains causing nosocomial infection in Spain between 1980-1990 with special emphasis on the incidence of serotype 0:12 strains. METHODS 11,411 strains of P. aeruginosa from hospital-acquired infections were studied and epidemiologically characterized by phage-typing, serotyping and sensitivity to antimicrobial agents. The strains of the 0:12 serotype were analyzed by isoenzyme analysis. RESULTS Although the major serotypes throughout the period studied were: 0:1, 0:6 and 0:11, the existence of serotype 0:12 strains (6%) were detected which had produced nosocomial outbreaks in surrounding countries. This serotype is homogeneous in that the epidemiologic markers and patterns of sensitivity to antibiotics and the multienzyme analysis demonstrate uniformity in the electrophoretic patterns of all the strains studied. CONCLUSIONS The 0:12 serotype is in Spain indistinguishable by phage typing and studies of antibiotic sensitivity. It may be considered as being of clonal origin and is probably equal to that existing elsewhere in Europe.</dc:description>
