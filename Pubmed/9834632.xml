<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To analyze differences in blood pressure levels in children and adolescents in Galicia with those of peers living in other parts of Spain. DESIGN Cross-sectional study done in a rural area in Galicia. PARTICIPANTS 870 boys and girls 6 to 16 years old. They are compared with published data from the RICARDIN study, that includes 10,042 participants selected at the schools in nine centers of Spain (one was the center in Galicia). MEASUREMENTS Standardized methodology and certification procedures were used in Galicia and Spain to measure weight, height, Quételet index, systolic (SBP) and fifth-phase diastolic blood pressure (DBP5) and sexual maturation. Data are presented by sex and age group (1 year) both in Galicia and Spain. RESULTS From 11 years and above, girls in Galicia present higher SBP than in Spain. In boys, the difference appears later. Galicia shows higher DBP5 levels than Spain in every age-sex group. In relation to obesity, the differences are of a small magnitude in the Quételet index, again, higher values in Galicia. CONCLUSIONS This is the first population-based study available that rules out the possibility that the observed differences, previously already suggested, could be attributed to methodological problems. The differences in blood pressure and obesity between Galicia and other areas of Spain, already previously suggested in adults, can be the reflection of differences present from childhood.</dc:description>
