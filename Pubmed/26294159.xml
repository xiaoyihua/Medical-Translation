<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The diagnosis of Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome should be considered in patients with cerebellar lesions who also suffer cognitive deficits associated with visuospatial or executive neuropsychological disorders, expressive language disorders and affective disorders. CLINICAL CASE A 16 year old adolescent diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at the age of 7 presents with emotional instability, apathy, and speech and reading difficulties. Neuropsychological tests show visuospatial difficulties. A brain magnetic resonance imaging is performed due to impaired coordination and fine motor movements and shows atrophy of the cerebellar vermis. The clinical picture suggests a diagnosis of Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome. The cerebellum is mostly known for its motor role. However, it is also involved in higher cognitive functions, expression of emotion and behavioral regulation. Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome is a relatively unknown diagnosis and should be included in the differential diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders with cerebellar lesion.</dc:description>
