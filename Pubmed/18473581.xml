<dc:description xml:lang="en">We are presenting the case of a 54 year-old woman, who had a kidney transplant. She came to our laboratory to consult for two cutaneous lesions: a cystic one at the back of her right leg and one localized on dorsum of left forearm. Biopsies of both lesions were performed for a histopathologic study as well as microbiological (both bacteriologic and mycologic) cultures. The histopathologic study showed a lesion compatible with a B type cutaneous lymphoma in the lesion in her leg, while in the mycologic study of the cystic lesion elements compatible with phaeohyphomycosis were observed. Development of Wangiella dermatitidis was obtained in the cultures. The cystic lesion localized on forearm was completely removed by surgery, while the lesion in the leg received oncological treatment. The aim of this paper is to describe the first published case of phaeohyphomycosis, by W. dermatitidis, in the Argentine Republic.</dc:description>
