<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two cases of aberrant left pulmonary artery are described. One of them died on the third day of life and had esophageal atresia and Fallot tetralogy as associated anomalies. Outstanding symptoms of this anomaly were bouts of respiratory difficulty with espiratory wheezing. During these episodes radiographic findings were right or bilateral lung hyperaireation and middle lobe atelectasis. Upper respiratory infections usually preceded these bouts of respiratory difficulty. Diagnosis was established by the presence of a notch on the anterior wall of the esophagus, diminished pulmonary perfusion of the left lung as shown by pulmonary gammagraphy and characteristic findings in pulmonary arteriography. During the last 12 months the first case, now aged three years, has had a spontaneous regression of symptoms.</dc:description>
