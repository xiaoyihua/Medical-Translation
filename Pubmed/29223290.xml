<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Clinical research is the study of patients with the aim of improving care. Our objectives were to calculate the percentage of presentations at territorial section meetings of the Spanish Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (AEDV) that described clinical research, to assess the level of evidence the research provided, and to analyze change in clinical research volume over time. MATERIAL AND METHODS We reviewed supplements of the journal Actas Dermo-Sifiliográficas for 2000 through 2015 that contained abstracts of presentations given at the AEDV section meetings in Galicia; the area comprising Asturias, Cantabria, and Castile-Leon (ACCL); and Andalusia. We selected abstracts that met a previously validated definition of clinical research and categorized each according to level of evidence. We also analyzed how the weight of clinical research presentations changed over time. RESULTS Of the total of 1,188 presentations, 29.6% met the criteria that defined clinical research. Most provided level-4 evidence (95.2%); 44.2% of those presentations reported cross-sectional studies and 55.8% analyzed case series. Clinical research accounted for 26.6% of the presentations in Galicia (94.7% of them, level 4), 22.7% of those at the ACCL meeting (97.6%, level 4), and 37.2% of those in Andalusia (94.3%, level 4). The proportion of clinical research increased significantly over the years studied. CONCLUSIONS Clinical research accounted for 29.6% of the communications presented at the meetings we reviewed. Most of these presentations concerned case series or cross-sectional studies. The prevalence of clinical research presentations differed between the 3 territories studied, but the levels of evidence were similar. The proportion of clinical research in the programs of these meetings has increased over time.</dc:description>
