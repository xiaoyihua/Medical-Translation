<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography MRCP) is a non-invasive diagnostic method for choledocholithiasis. AIM To evaluate the results of MRCP in the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective review of MRCP reports performed between October 2001 and December 2004. We included patients with suspected choledocholithiasis who were studied with MRCP and some other confirmatory test such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ERCP), surgical common bile duct exploration or transcystic colangiography TC). RESULTS One hundred and twenty five patients aged 58+/-20 years 70 females) were included. In 54 patients 43%) we compared the results of MRCP with the findings of surgical common bile duct exploration or TC and in 71 57%) we did so with ERCP. MRCP suggested choledocholithiasis in 93 patients and in 32 it was negative. Eighty six 67%) patients had choledocholithiasis according to TC or ERCP, including 3 patients who had a negative MRCP. Therefore the sensibility was 97%, specificity 74% positive predictive value 89%, negative predictive value 90% and accuracy of MRCP was 90% for the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis. CONCLUSIONS MRCP has a high accuracy for the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis.</dc:description>
