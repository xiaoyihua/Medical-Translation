<dc:description xml:lang="en">FOUNDATION Bone Paget's disease (BPD) is a focal disorder of bone remodeling of unknown etiology that affects mainly patients older than 50 years. BPD is after osteoporosis the most frequent osteopathy of the western world and was described for the first time in 1876 by Sir James Paget who called it osteitis deformans. PATIENTS AND METHODS We present two patients with BPD younger than 40 years. In this report their clinical, analytical, diagnostic, and therapeutic manifestations are described, with the findings of bone biopsy in one of them. Is noteworthy to us the younger age of the patients, rare for this disease, which means that we have carried out the follow-up of the cases. CONCLUSION In a young adult with high phosphatase alkaline values we will include BPD in the differential diagnosis.</dc:description>
