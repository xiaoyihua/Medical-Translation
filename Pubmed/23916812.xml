<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS To translate and culturally adapt the Pain Level outcome to the Spanish context to validate the contents of the Spanish version of the «Pain level» outcome. METHOD The original English version of the «Pain level» outcome was translated into Spanish (twice); then back-translated into English, and all the discrepancies were resolved after consulting with NOC authors. A panel consisting of 21 experts in pain care assessed this culturally adapted Spanish version, in order to score the content validity. In the first step, the experts scored the adequacy of each indicator to the concept «Pain level». In the second round, three new indicators were scored. The Statistical analysis included content validity index (CVI), probability of agreement by chance, and modified kappa statistic. RESULTS A Spanish version was developed including label, definition, two groups of indicators, and two measurement scales. This version is fully adapted to the Spanish context and language. A set of 21 indicators (19 translated and two new) was selected, and 4 were deleted (three translated and one new). The CVI-average score was 0.83 and the CVI-universal agreement was 0.05. CONCLUSION The Spanish-version of the outcome «Pain level» is semantically and culturally to adapted to a Spanish context and preserves equivalency with the original. Content validation has identified indicators useful for practice. The clinimetric properties (validity and reliability) of the adapted version could be tested in a clinical study with people suffering from acute pain.</dc:description>
