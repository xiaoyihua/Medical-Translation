<dc:description xml:lang="en">Due to the fact that the treatment in chronic respiratory patients is almost completely palliative, it is important to find some kind of scale which can yield precise information on the limitations which the subject has to face on his/her day-to-day life. Respiratory function tests and dyspnea scales are not appropriately enough systems for such purpose, therefore during the last few years several CV tests have been applied, general or specific, standardized or not. The method which currently seems more useful is CRQ, even tough SGRQ seems to be the more promising, due to the fact that it has been fully standardized and allows interindividual as well as and in interpopulation comparisons.</dc:description>
