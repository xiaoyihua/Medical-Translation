<dc:description xml:lang="es">Objective: To analyze the results of fibrinolytic therapy in our center in the management of ischemia secondary to arterial bypass occlusions. Material and methods: A retrospective study was conducted that included all patients who were undergoing fibrinolysis due to a bypass obstruction in our Department from January 2009 to December 2012. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 13.0 program. The obstructed lower limbs bypass less than fifteen days from the onset of symptoms of exacerbation were analyzed by determining the efficacy and safety using the Kaplan-Meyer method. Demographics, dates, characteristics of the clinical episode and obstructed bypass were also recorded. Results: A total of 45 patients underwent fibrinolytic therapy: 35 infra-inguinal and 10 suprainguinal. Almost all (95.5%) were prosthetic grafts. Mean follow-up was 25.8 ± 17.7 months. The mean age was 67 ± 10.7 years, 15.6% of patients were older than 80 years, and 17.8% were women. Pain at rest was the presenting symptom in 86.7% of patients. Technical success was observed in 41 patients (91.1%). The post-operative mortality was 6.7%, and 17.8% of patients had some type of major complication. Survival rates free of death, amputation, and reoperation were 86.1, 71.5 and 55.6% per year, respectively. Conclusions: The use of fibrinolysis in the treatment of acute lower extremity bypass occlusion is an alternative treatment that provides acceptable results. In our experience, we obtained death-free, reoperation-free and amputation-free survival rates comparable to results published in international series (AU)</dc:description>
