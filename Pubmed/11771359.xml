<dc:description xml:lang="en">Although internal auditory canal (IAC) and cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors are rare, their clinical suspicion is quite common in the otolaryngology office. MRI is the imaging modality of choice in diagnosing these tumors. Perceived high costs may prevent clinicians from using it as a screening tool. A protocol designed to improve cost-effectiveness in such diagnosis results in a more rationale clinical practice. Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of MRI as screening tool in diagnosis of IAC and CPA tumors in our population. Between March 1998 and March 2000, a prospective series of 200 cases had a MRI screening requested. MRI were performed following Fast Spin Echo technique, providing T2-weighted images. Gadolinium enhanced MRI was reserved for selected cases. We report on 190 MRI done. We found 7 neuromas (3.5%), one CPA metastasis, one epidermoid cyst and 9 IAC vascular anomalies. Only 138 cases (69%) had normal MRI images. When used following a designed protocol, MRI is our procedure of choice while screening IAC and CPA tumors because it is a cost-effective tool.</dc:description>
