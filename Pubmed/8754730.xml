<dc:description xml:lang="en">The prevalence of fibrocystic breast disease in patients with endometriosis, was determined. This was a prospective cross-sectional study. The 43 women were diagnosed as having endometriosis by laparoscopy. In these patients, during their control period, a deliberate search for clinical and ultrasonography data on fibrocystic breast disease was carried out. The average age was 28 years, ranging between 18 and 36 years. From 43 the patients with endometriosis, 37% of them were diagnosed with fibrocystic breast disease. The group of age more frequent was between 30 and 34 years in 37.5%, and 31% between 20 and 24 years of age. 43% of the patients with both diseases had antecedent of pregnancy and 25% had menstrual alterations. The prevalence of fibrocystic breast disease in patients with endometriosis was 37%, thus observing a strong evidence of association between both pathologies.</dc:description>
