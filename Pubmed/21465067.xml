<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Patient misidentification continues to be a quality and safety significant issue. The Joint Commission International listed patient identification as the first of ten life-saving patient-safety solutions. Identification wrist bands are the goal in the identification strategy. At the Hospital Nacional de Pediatría "Prof. Dr. J.P. Garrahan" we inquired about perception and agreement of this practice within hospital staff and parents. METHOD A short questionnaire was used with; in the first part a four point Lickert scale, and in the second one an open unstructured response. The questionnaire was distributed among health care workers and parent's patients. For families, the third question was not administrated. The survey explored about purpose and opportunity regarding the use of wrist band identification. A one day cutoff was made to obtain baseline data for properly use of identification bands. RESULTS A total of 300 questionnaires were analyzed, 100 for each cluster (physicians, nurses, and parents); 82% responded that the wrist band should stay along the whole hospitalizing period. A range of 64% to 74% within the groups responded that it is helpful to prevent errors. There was no statistical difference between parents and physicians. Overall, percentage of patient with correct identification band in the hospital was 34%. CONCLUSIONS We concluded that the wrist band identification is not a health care workers priority behavior yet. Initiatives on safety patient identifications, including families and healthcare workers, must be developed in the near future.</dc:description>
