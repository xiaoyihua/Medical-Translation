<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Infant feeding in the first months/years of life affects the health in the short and long term. Breastfeeding is the perfect food due to its many benefits. However, when breastfeeding is not possible, infant formulas are the best alternative. The aim of this study is to define the role of the supplemented formulas in infant nutrition using the opinion of a panel of experts in infant gastroenterology and nutrition. MATERIAL AND METHODS A survey, using 62 items, stratified into 5 blocks, was performed by 48 panelists using the Delphi method to achieve a professional criteria consensus on nutritional aspects of infant formulas. RESULTS A consensus was reached in 64.6% of the items, with a non-unified agreement being established as regards the nutritional aspects of infant formulas, and their influence in body and brain development and immune maturity. CONCLUSIONS According to the experts surveyed, there is consensus as regards the suitable composition of lipids, lactose, calcium, vitamin D, and prebiotics in infant formulas, for a correct cerebral, immune and somatic development. There was no consensus on the not yet well-defined subjects, such as nutritional quality of proteins, use of thickeners, taurine supplementation, probiotic, and symbiotic aspects. More studies are necessary to confirm these subjects.</dc:description>
