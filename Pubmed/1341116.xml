<dc:description xml:lang="en">A 46-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain, nausea vomiting and abdominal distention. Small bowel x-rays and CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel obstruction due to malignant melanoma. The diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma was performed 8 years prior to admission on one lesion in the back. Patient received surgical treatment. Completed resection of an involved jejunal [correction of ileal] segment was performed. Three tumor masses were found at laparotomy. Metastasis from malignant melanoma at the gastrointestinal tract occurs frequently though rarely are these intestinal lesions symptomatic. The efficacy of surgical treatment for symptomatic metastatic melanoma is justified to relief symptoms and prolonged survival.</dc:description>
