<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report a 57 year-old woman with a big partially cystic adrenal pheochromocytoma presenting with high fever and abdominal pain. Based on CT scan images and before knowing urinary catecholamines level, the diagnosis of sepsis secondary to an abscessed adrenal macrotumor was done. A diagnostic percutaneous fine-needle puncture and aspiration was done and antibiotic therapy was started. One week later an open surgical drainage and installation of percutaneous drainage tubes was carried out. Both procedures were uneventful and the patient improved dramatically. Three months later a definitive excision surgery was done. After 14 months of follow up, the patient is in excellent conditions and her abdominal CT scan is normal.</dc:description>
