<dc:description xml:lang="en">A kidney transplant often leads to an increase in body weight, with an altered composition of the organism. This study assessed the body composition of a population with kidney transplant and an excess of weight (IMC &gt; 25), using anthropometry, electric bio-impedance, and infrared interactance. The results were compared with the mean values (P50) for the Spanish population, and the differences between men and women were analyzed. The assessment of the body composition using anthropometry resulted in weight percentages, -mid-arm circumference, and -mid-arm muscle circumference of the upper arms, which were slightly higher than the P50, without there being any differences between the two sexes. The triceps fold showed values which were much higher than the average value, and this was more markedly seen in male. All patients showed an android type obesity pattern, and this was greater in men. The electric bio-impedance analysis and the infra-red interactance showed high fat levels for both sexes, without any statistically significant differences with respect to the percentages of fat mass, lean mass and water with both methods. The study has shown that the weight increase as a result of the kidney transplant, is mainly accompanied by an increase in the adipose tissue, and this is more marked in patients of the male sex, in such a way that the typical significant differences between both sexes with respect to the fat mass, commonly seen the general population, disappear.</dc:description>
