<dc:description xml:lang="en">We analyzed the clinical characteristics, complications, severity, and maternal and fetal survival of patients suffering from HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes level, Low Platelet count) requiring admission to the intensive care unit in four hospitals from Buenos Aires area, Argentina. Data was revised in the charts from March 1997 to March 2003 and 62 patients were included in the study. During the second half of pregnancy or immediate puerperal period, diagnostic criteria were defined on the basis of preeclampsia and the following laboratory abnormalities: platelet count nadir &lt;150,000/mm3, serum hepatic aminotransferases &gt;70 UI/l, and serum lactic dehydrogenase &gt;600 UI/l, total bilirubin &gt;1.2 mg/dl and/or periferical blood smear with hemolysis. The mean maternal age was 28 +/- 8 years; parity 2.7 +/- 2.3; gestational age 33 +/- 4 weeks. According to platelet count, 23 cases were identified to class 1, 29 to class 2 and the rest to Martin's class 3. There were 16 eclamptic patients. The platelet count was 67,604 +/- 31,535/mm3; alanine aminotransferase 271 +/- 297 UI/l; aspartate aminotransferase 209 +/- 178 UI/l; serum lactic dehydrogenase 1444 +/- 1295 UI/l; serum creatininine levels 1.1 +/- 0.8 mg/dl. Forty-one patients had diverse degree of renal function damage, renal dialysis and plasmapheresis was required in one female. Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema was observed in four patients. All obstetric patients survived. There were four perinatal deaths. In our population sample, low rate of life-threatening maternal complications and low perinatal mortality were observed.</dc:description>
