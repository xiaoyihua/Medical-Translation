<dc:description xml:lang="en">The scientific and technological advances have allowed that to the patients with acute coronary syndromes, offer an alternative to them of treatment in the rooms of hemodynamic by means of coronary interventionism, using catheter compliante or noncompliante ball, ball of cut, implanting stent nonliberating and liberating of drugs, avoiding to them the risk of a greater surgery to place venous or arterial bridges in the affected zone; receiving therefore the benefit of a percutaneous coronary revascularization, by means of a procedure less aggressive than the surgery without the risks of traqueal intubation, thoracotomy, saphenectomy, cardioplegia, drainages, minor risk of bled and infection, short period of time of hospitalization, decrease of the costs and the time for its restoration to the daily life. During the development of coronary interventionism personal professional participates: interventionist, anesthesiologist cardiologist, nurse and technician in Rx. The coronary interventionist procedure is a common procedure but of high risk, since the manipulation of the catheters and guides is direct in the light of the glass to treat; only in the year of 1997 a million procedures were made at world-wide level, without a doubt some, this has been increased enormously, demanding so the infirmary professional that toils in the room of hemodynamic maintains updated in the different techniques from coronary interventionism, as well as to know the diverse instruments and devices that the biomedical industry develops day to day to provide a free suitable attention of risk.</dc:description>
