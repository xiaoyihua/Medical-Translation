<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of the present work is to find out whether nervous structures (hypothalamus, hypophysis, septal area, amygdala, caudate nucleus, anterior cortex (latero-frontal), posterior cortex (latero-occipital); and the glandular structures (testicles, adrenal gland, and seminal vesicle) involved in the regulation of the sexual behaviour of the male rat, are altered after an alcohol intake extending over 36 generations. The animals were killed by decapitation immediately after the sexual behaviour test was carried out. Then the oxidative metabolism (manometric technique) and the weight of the structures mentioned above were examined. The statistical analysis of the results showed that prolonged intake of alcohol over a period of 36 generations produces a significant increase in the consumption of O2 where the ventromedial hypothalamus, septal area, hypophysis, amygdala, caudate nucleus, and anterior cortex are concerned; whereas a significant decrease in the weight of testicles, hypophysis, and adrenal gland was observed. However the weight of the seminal vesicles underwent a significant increase after intake over a long period of ethanol when it was compared with its respective control. In view of these results the influence of alcohol on the oxidative metabolism of the lymbical structures is discussed, as is also the effect of alcohol on the reproductive system of these animals.</dc:description>
