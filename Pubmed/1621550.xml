<dc:description xml:lang="en">The fate of some infiltrant tumours of the bladder locally advanced (pT2-3NxM0) which were radically resected, with or without association to other treatments, has been similar to those in which initial radical treated was used. To carry out simultaneously a radical RTU as a local action plus systemic chemotherapy (M-VAC), for microscopic metastasis, clinically undetected, seems to us the most effective combination. In our Urology Unit, the evolution (September 88-January 91) of 9 patients presenting this tumour and preservation of the bladder is being followed-up. The primary tumour was treated with radical RTU in 7 cases and partial cystectomy in 2. There are 5 tP2, 1 pT2 + "in situ" carcinoma (Ca) and 3 pT3, 4 G1, 4 G2 and 1 G3. All tumours were single, small (2-4 cm), with varied location and nearly all with medium to low differentiation. Later all patients underwent systemic chemotherapy with M-VAC (3 cycles). Following RTU and QMT every three months, the likely local and systemic progression of the disease has been evaluated through cystoscopy and multiple biopsies including from the prostatic urethra, RTU of anterior scar, two-hand palpation, urinary cytology, blood testing, CAT, abdominal ECO, chest X-ray and laparoscopic lymphadenectomy (coinciding with its development within the Unit) in the last case. Average follow-up (at the time of the review) has been 15.77 months (6-28 months).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
