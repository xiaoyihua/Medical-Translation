<dc:description xml:lang="en">Neutropenic enterocolitis (NE) is a serious complication in neutropenic patients; it often affects the cecum and the ascending colon. Most cases have been reported in neutropenic patients after chemotherapy for hematologic neoplasms, and some in association with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, benign cyclic neutropenia, and solid neoplasms. As far as we know, four cases of NE associated to AA (aplastic anemia, hypoplastic bone marrow) have been previously reported, two of them with autopsy studies. The macroscopic findings in the enterocolonic lesions were not illustrated. We report the first two cases in Mexico. The NE was neither clinically nor radiographically suspected initially, i.e. the morphologic diagnosis of their colonic lesions were amebic colitis in one and edematous ulcerated colitis in the other. Medical treatment without surgery was instituted. Both died. The macroscopic aspect of the enterocolonic lesions in NE associated to aplastic anemia in our two patients was similar to that in NE associated to hematologic neoplasms. In Mexico there is little experience in the clinical, radiographic or morphologic diagnosis of this rare association.</dc:description>
