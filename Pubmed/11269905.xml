<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Considerable controversies exist about the psychological impact of dentofacial deformities and the effects of treatment on body image. This research, which is a part of a longitudinal prospective study about a number of psychological aspects of adult patients with severe dentofacial deformities treated by orthognatic surgery, assesses the body image of a sample of patients before and after treatment. METHOD Two subscales, general and facial-oclusal, of the modified Secord and Jourard test were used to evaluate body image of a sample of orthognatic surgery patients (N = 58). The questionnaires were completed at four time points: one week before surgery (T0), and one (T1), six (T6) and twelve months (T12) after surgery. RESULTS Despite the severity of dentofacial deformity, presurgical mean scores of both subscales of body image test were normal. T6 scores were significantly higher than normative levels in both subscales (p &lt; 0.001). T6 scores were also significantly higher than T0 in both general (p &lt; 0.05) and facial-oclusal subscales (p &lt; 0.001). T12 measurements showed significant differences in both subscales with respect to normative levels but significant differences between T12 and T0 were only found in facial oclusal subscale (p &lt; 0.001). No differences were found between T12 and T6 scores. CONCLUSION The positive effect of orthognatic surgery on body image is encouraging, but longer follow up is needed to evaluate the persistence of results and the eventual occurrence of any late change.</dc:description>
