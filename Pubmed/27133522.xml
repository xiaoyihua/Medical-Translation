<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Caecal volvulus is an uncommon cause of intestinal obstruction. Its clinical presentation is non-specific, with the diagnosis usually confirmed by barium enema and abdominal computed tomography. Treatment depends on many factors, and minimally invasive approaches are becoming the treatment of choice. CLINIC CASE A 54 years old female, admitted to the Emergency Department with clinical symptoms of intestinal obstruction. On physical examination she had a palpable, firm, and tympanitic mass in the right abdomen, with peritoneal irritation. The radiographs of the abdomen, barium enema and abdominal computed tomography showed caecal volvulus. As she showed a full remission after the barium enema, with no clinical or biochemical data of systemic inflammatory response syndrome or peritoneal irritation, she was discharged to her home. Two weeks later, a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed with an ileo-transverse extracorporeal anastomosis. Her progress was satisfactory, and she was discharged 4 days after surgery due to improvement. CONCLUSION Caecal volvulus is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction, with high mortality rates, and is caused by excessive mobility of the caecum. Its incidence is increasing. Treatment depends on many factors. Early non-surgical untwisting, followed by an elective laparoscopic surgical procedure offers several advantages and reduces mortality.</dc:description>
