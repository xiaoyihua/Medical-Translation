<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Despite several surgical robots operating in Spain, the experience in pediatric pathology is limited. We found interesting to review the first full pediatric series in our country. We would like to share as well our views on the transition from conventional to robotic laparoscopy. METHODS Retrospective review of all the pediatric laparoscopic surgery assisted by the da Vinci robot (Intuitive Surgical), in our center, between April 2009 and February 2010. RESULTS 8 patients were operated (7-15 years), with an average weight of 42 Kg (18 to 83 Kg). 11 procedures were performed: bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (1), inguinal hernia (1), cholecystectomy (4), splenectomy (2), resection of pancreatic mass (1), fundoplication (1), adrenalectomy (1). All proceedings, except two, were completed with the robot. As complications, there was one intraoperative bleeding that required blood transfusion, and in the postoperative period, there was a surgical wound infection. There were no conversions to open surgery. The average time of preparation before surgery was 130 minutes. The three-dimensional vision and lack of tremor are the main advantages cited by all surgeons. CONCLUSIONS The learning curve of Robotic Surgery is shorter than that of conventional laparoscopy. Trained surgeons can perform complex procedures laparoscopically from the outset. The main difficulty in children is the proper planning of trocar placement, due to the smaller size of the surgical field. The organization of surgery is complex and success depends on close collaboration of all stakeholders.</dc:description>
