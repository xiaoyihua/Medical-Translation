<dc:description xml:lang="es">Introduction: The metabolic syndrome (MS) consists of a set of clinical and biochemical changes. It is very common among chronic hemodialysis patients, being the leading cause of death in these patients, 44% of all patients undergoing this therapy. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of MS and risk factors associated with its development, as well as the prevalence of obesity in HD patients. Methods: This study has followed 90 patients of both sexes with chronic renal failure (CRF) who were treated with hemodialysis periodically in our unit for ten years. All patients were performed quarterly measurements of plasma albumin (A1b) and other biochemical analysis; besides, they underwent some anthropometric measurements like weight, height and body mass index (BMI). This was calculated using weight / size2 formula and grouped in BMI values according to WHO criteria. The data concerning hypertension and glucose were also considered. Results: The prevalence of MS was 25% and obesity was presented as follows: 45% with type I overweight; 30.8% with type II overweight and 12 patients (2%) were obese. Being statistically significant as risk factors, BMI, overweight, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol as well as hypertension and elevated glucose levels were obtained. Conclusions: The metabolic syndrome compromises the patient survival causing a high prevalence in these patients. The principal risk factors in MS are monitoring weight, BMI, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes (AU)</dc:description>
