<dc:description xml:lang="en">Acquired tracheal stenosis in children can be either to direct cervicothoracic trauma or to post-intubation. Resection and end-to-end anastomosis continues to be the treatment of choice. The high rate of restenosis is directly related to anastomotic tension in resections of more than 2 cm. We report a case of a 7 year old child who suffered severe injury caused by car crash and intubation at the scene of the accident, with subsequent development of a cervical tracheal stenosis which required preoperative iterative laser sessions and balloon dilatation on 3 occasions, without result. Resection and primary anastomosis with an external stent of ePTFE was performed. The patient was treated successfully and was extubated promptly. Post-operative endoscopic studies and magnetic resonance imaging showed widely patent tracheal lumina with no stenosis. Three years post-operatively, the child is asymptomatic and participates in competitive sport activities. We can conclude that the model described above was clinically effective in the prevention of post-anastomotic tracheal stenosis in the child.</dc:description>
