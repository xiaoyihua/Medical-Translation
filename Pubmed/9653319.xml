<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Evaluate an increase in the level of theoretical and practical knowledge type II diabetics have about diets based on rations. DESIGN Prospective Study MATERIAL AND METHODS 13 Type II diabetics from a rural area between 45 and 70 years old with a glycosidic hemoglobin greater than 8%. DM theoretical knowledge test, validated by Campo et al. before and after the process. Practical exercise about the quantity of carbohydrates patients served themselves in their meals, before and after the process. RESULTS Subjects tested showed improvement in the percentage of correctly answered questions on the knowledge test, whether computed by sections or globally. Subjects tested chose foods with a lower quantity of carbohydrates in them. CONCLUSIONS DRAWN BY THE PANEL OF AUTHORS: Upon completion of this educational procedure, the results were positive. A practical educational procedure yields more effective results than does a theoretical procedure in our patients and our medium. Patients demonstrated a greater level of satisfaction regarding their condition due to an increased knowledge about their disease and in particular, a better understanding about their diets.</dc:description>
