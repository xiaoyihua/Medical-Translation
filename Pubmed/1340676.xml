<dc:description xml:lang="en">A group of consecutive patients with ulcer dyspepsia were studied by endoscopy, antral and duodenal biopsy; by histologic determination of Helicobacter pylori (HP) and by silver staining (Warthin Starry technique). 68.31% were found to be infected. In those patients who showed chronic antritis (69.30% of the patients), HP was present in 92.85% of cases. In gastric and duodenal ulcer patients, similar rates were shown (76.47% and 76.92% respectively. In cases with normal histology findings HP was present in only 12.90% of cases. In the duodenum HP was scarce (7.92%) and there was always concomitant metaplasias. HP is strongly linked with mucosal lesions in our patients with ulcer dyspepsia. We wonder its responsibility in producing these lesions and about the need of performing specific treatment against HP in this patients.</dc:description>
