<dc:description xml:lang="en">The usefulness of two alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine and guanfacine) and their comparative effectiveness were evaluated regarding the control of the opiates abstinence syndrome and the secondary effects, including development of cardiovascular abnormalities, in 88 parenteral heroin abusers admitted to two hospital units for the treatment of addiction. The patients were treated in a random, double blind fashion, with clonidine or guanfacine. In the study dosages, both drugs proved to be useful to control the abstinence syndrome. Nearly 70% of those treated with any of the two agonists were able to complete the treatment. When both drugs were compared, a higher degree of restlessness (p less than 0.01) was found among those treated with clonidine, although there were no differences in any other evaluated parameters to compare the degree of abstinence in each drug. The most commonly found side effects were orthostatism, lassitude, mental torpor and oral xerosis. These were independent of the drug used. There were no differences between both drugs regarding heart rate or blood pressure, although both parameters were significantly modified with the doses used in the study.</dc:description>
