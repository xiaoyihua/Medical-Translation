<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to determine the diagnostic reliability of the renogram with diuretic stimulus simultaneously at the administration of the dose, comparing two groups of 59 patients each one (F0 and F+10), to select patients for surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is an retrospective study about two groups of 59 patients to whom the diuretic renogram was carried out by stimulus (furosemide), by suspicion of ureteropelvic or vesicoureteral obstruction, using (99m)Tc-Mercaptoacetylglicine. In the first one, the study was conducted applying the diuretic stimulus 600 seconds after the administration of the dose of the radiotracer (F+10). In the second one it was carried out simultaneously to the administration (F0). For the interpretation there was used the visual analysis, the parameters of the curves and the percentage of elimination after modification by the severity and micturition. Statistical analysis of the information was made. RESULTS The F+10 renogram shows a sensitivity of 96,7%, specificity of 96,1%, positive predictive value of 90,6%, and a negative predictive value of 98,6%. The F0 renogram shows a sensitivity of 95,2%, specificity of 98,9%, positive predictive value of 95,2%, and a negative predictive value of 98,9%. CONCLUSION The performance of renogram by means of the administration of diuretic stimulus at the same time as the administration of the radiotracer is a useful and comfortable method in paediatric patients, not supposing a significant wastage in the parameters of efficiency of the test in the patients selection for surgery.</dc:description>
