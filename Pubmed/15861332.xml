<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION At date, there is increasing evidence that inflammatory processes are involved in cerebrovascular events. Trauma and ischemic injury are characterized by acute local inflammation and changes in levels of inflammatory cytokines in body fluids of human patients. However, very few studies have been directed to establish the role and the relationship between inflammation and hemorrhagic stroke. DEVELOPMENT After intracerebral hemorrhage, inflammatory mediators from the blood might enter to the brain and induce an inflammatory reaction, although the brain cells itself are capable of producing many of these agents. Whatever, this markers of inflammation contributes to the development of a systemic response. High levels of C reactive protein (CRP), an acute and sensitive phase protein to inflammatory reactions, are present among individuals at risk for future cerebro or cardiovascular event. Elevated CRP also predicts the outcome. CONCLUSION We present the little evidence about the relationship between inflammation and hemorrhagic stroke.</dc:description>
