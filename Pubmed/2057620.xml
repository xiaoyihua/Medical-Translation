<dc:description xml:lang="en">The study involved 40 children ASA I to II type who were randomly divided into two groups of 20 patients with comparable age and sex profile. Premedication consisting of 0.2 mg/kg of midazolam (Dormicum, Roche) and 0.015 mg/kg of atropine was administered 30 to 40 min before surgical intervention by intramuscular way in one group and by intranasal in the other one. In the operating room a peripheral vein was cannulated and general anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium and succinylcholine. Arterial blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, arterial blood pressure and respiratory rate were measured at baseline, beginning of sedation (closing eyes), and arrival at the operating room. The time at the onset of sedation, the degree of sedation at the operating room, and the reaction to the venopuncture were also measured. In both groups of patients heart rate and systolic arterial blood pressure measured at the arrival to the operating room were significantly higher than those recorded at baseline and at the onset of sedation. Diastolic blood pressure in patients with intranasal premedication increased on arrival to the operating room with respect to the sedation values. Arterial oxygen saturation significantly decreased from the baseline values in both groups at the onset of sedation and on arrival at the operating room. There were no significant changes in respiratory rate. None of the alterations had clinical consequences. There were no significant differences in the onset of sedation (12.42 +/- 4.07 min in the intramuscular group and 15.26 +/- 7.99 min in the intranasal administration), degree of sedation and response to venopunction in either group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
