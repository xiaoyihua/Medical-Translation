<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To study an outbreak of media news related to nosocomial infections due to opportunistic fungi in Spanish hospitals. CASE DEFINITION any news related to possible nosocomial infection due to opportunistic fungi in Spanish hospitals, published in national or local daily newspapers, over the pre-epidemic (July-December, 1998) and epidemic periods (January-June, 1999). All news were reviewed and identified using global press reports summaries, prepared by two independent sources, and were analyzed by three different observers. RESULTS Over the pre-epidemic period there were not any news related to nosocomial infections due to opportunistic fungi. Over the epidemic period, a total of 218 news were identified, 154 (71%) published in national newspapers and 64 (29%) in local ones. We analyzed separately 18 editorials or opinion articles related to this subject. The epidemic curve (distribution of news by week) showed an incidence news peak at week 5 (102 news, 46.7% of all news published). The media mentioned up to 19 different hospitals as institutions with possible cases of nosocomial fungal infections. After week 8, news incidence drop, and remain thereafter at minimum levels. CONCLUSIONS The example provided by the analysis of this outbreak of media news, related to nosocomial infections by Aspergillus an other opportunistic fungi, is useful to allow us understand how some medical news arise, develop and were transmitted. The public alert situation created in Spain was remarkable, and it is likely that there was a transient loss of confidence in the safety of public health institutions. Today's medicine requires a great and better openness to the media, and a better cooperation between both parts.</dc:description>
