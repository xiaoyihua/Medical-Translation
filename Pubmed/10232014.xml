<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections usually produce respiratory symptoms, that only exceptionally involve the nervous system. In this case, the infection generally causes an encephalitic picture characterized by impaired consciousness and seizures, and by normal or non-specific neuroradiological findings. However, four cases of M. pneumoniae infection associated with symmetrical lesions in the putamen and its external surrounding areas, and with extrapiramidal symptoms, have been recently published. We present the case of a patient with a clinical picture characterized by confusion, fever, and seizures, associated with a M. pneumoniae infection. The MRI study showed two symmetrical lesions that involved the areas just outside the putamen and disappeared coinciding with her clinical improvement. The present case would support that the encephalopathy associated with the M. pneumoniae infection shows a tendency to involve a particular region of the brain. Our case might represent the minimal expression of these characteristic lesions, which in the most benign cases would involve the areas immediately outside the putamen, and in other instances the putamen as well.</dc:description>
