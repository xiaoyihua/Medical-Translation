<dc:description xml:lang="en">The interest in responding to socially determined health needs has led to an increased use of qualitative methodology by researchers and health professionals. This situation has prompted a search for new tools that will facilitate implementation and promote the quality of their research. The researcher's reflexivity and positionality have been described as very useful rigour strategies to promote theoretical-methodological congruency in qualitative research, as well as in generating new knowledge with a greater impact on health. Two methodological tools are presented here in the form of self-reflective questions, with some examples from qualitative health studies conducted in Spain, which can help novice researchers to plan how to commence a qualitative project. Some implications for the health research, practice and policy are discussed.</dc:description>
