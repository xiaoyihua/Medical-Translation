<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Anti secretory drugs, antimicrobials and bismuth salts are used with variable success to eradicate Helicobacter pylori. AIM To assess the effectiveness and rates of reinfection of two therapeutic modalities H pylori infection in adult patients with duodenal ulcer or non ulcer dyspepsia. METHODS During upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, 5 antral and 2 fundic biopsies were obtained and sent for microbiological and anatomopathological study. Patients infected with Helicobacter pylori were randomly assigned to receive during two weeks omeprazole 20 mg od plus amoxicillin 500 mg tid (group A) or bismuth subsalicylate 260 mg bid, metronidazole 250 mg tid and amoxicillin 500 mg tid (group B). A new endoscopy with antral and fundic biopsies was performed to all patients four weeks after discontinuing treatment and six months later to those in whom H pylori was eradicated. RESULTS Eighty patients (40 in each treatment group) completed the treatment and follow up. H pylori was eradicated in 22 patients of group A (55%) and 28 of group B (70%). Minor adverse effects were reported by 5 patients in group A (12%) and 11 in group B (27.5%). Six months later, reinfection was documented in 12 patients of group A and 8 of group B (54% and 30% of those with successful treatment respectively). Ten of twenty five patients with duodenal ulcer had reinfections, but there was only one ulcer relapse. CONCLUSIONS These two treatment modalities have similar results.</dc:description>
