<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To assess immediate and late results of Parks operation in the treatment of severe radiation rectitis. PATIENTS AND METHOD Retrospective review of clinical histories of 35 patients with uterine cervical cancer, 5 with endometrial cancer and one with vaginal cancer that received radiotherapy. Two years as a mean after radiotherapy, 14 women had rectal bleeding, 19 fistulae, 7 stenosis and 1 a rectal ulceration. All were initially treated with a discharge colostomy and after a mean interval of 1.6 years, a Parks operation was performed. RESULTS One patient died after surgery (2.4%) due to peritonitis and sepsis. Early surgical complications were necrosis of descended colon in 2, intra-abdominal abscess in 1, splenic rupture in 1 and postoperative bleeding in 1. Colostomy was closed in 37 patients three months after surgery. During late follow up (ranging from 3 to 64 months) rectal continence has been assessed as good in 30 patients, fair in 5 and bad in 2. Three women required a new colostomy. CONCLUSION Parks operation is a viable therapeutic alternative for severe radiation rectitis.</dc:description>
