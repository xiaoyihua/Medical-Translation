<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE A description of early diagnosis of cervical cancer in the Barbastro Hospital area. DESIGN Descriptive and retrospective study on all the CIN III cases collected in the Tumor Hospital Registry from 1989 to 1998. To correlate the data to the population covered by the hospital. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS 59 CIN III cases were detected and 16 invasive cancers. The total smears studied were 31409. The population covered was 50220 women, 15% of whom are between the age of 35 and 64. RESULTS The frequency of CIN III was 12 cases per 100000 women and year and of invasive cancers 3.2. From 59 CIN III 20 belong to the first five-year period and 39 to the second. The mean age was 37 12 (20-82). No significant statistical differences were found between five-year periods. The most frequent decade was 30-39 years (50% of cases). 10489 smears were studied from the first five-year period and 20911 from the second. 75% of invasive cases did not come from screening. CONCLUSIONS The tendency is that when the number of screened smears increases so does the number of CIN III. The frequency of the preneoplastic disease and invasive cancer is low. Therefore, close coordination between hospital departments of gynaecology and pathology together with primary health care is vital in order to extend the coverage, to reach risk groups and rationalise the screening of cervical cancer.</dc:description>
