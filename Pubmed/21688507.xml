<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The need for major opioids in the treatment of chronic pain unrelated to cancer is increasing. We therefore appraised available clinical practice guidelines in order to identify recommendations for good practice in the use of these drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS By searching the main guideline repositories as well as resources provided by medical associations, we identified clinical practice guidelines on the use of major opioids published up to 2007. Fourteen of the 28 guidelines we found met the inclusion criteria. To appraise the guidelines we applied the criteria for scientific evidence of the AGREE collaboration (Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation). The AGREE instrument consists of 23 items organized in 6 areas for appraisal. RESULTS Of the 14 guidelines appraised, 5 were judged to be of high quality. In each of the 5 selected guidelines, the relation between a recommendation and the evidence it was based on was stated explicitly; all 5 had overall quality scores over 60%. The recommendations drawn from these guidelines deal with 3 sequential moments in the use of opioids: start of treatment, maintenance therapy, and withdrawal of the drug. CONCLUSION The use of opioids to treat chronic noncancer pain is controversial in terms of effectiveness, safety, and the possibility of addiction or abuse. The opioid should be indicated for the pain and prescribed with caution; each case should be assessed individually. Following the recommendations drawn from these guidelines will be important for achieving control of both pain and the accompanying symptoms. The use of major opioids to relieve chronic pain unrelated to cancer, and therefore to improve the quality of life of patients who experience this type of pain, is a legitimate treatment approach.</dc:description>
