<dc:description xml:lang="en">Scientific activity in Chile from 1980 to 1982 was studied examining the publications registered by the Institute for Scientific Information. Abstracts were not considered. The list of publications which were produced in chilian laboratories was taken from the ASCA service. After classifying the areas to which each article belonged and also the university where the work was performed, the information was processed using a computer system. Almost 80% of the papers were published by universities. The more productive fields in the universities were biology (45,2%), medical sciences (25,9%) and chemistry (13,4%). Detailed data is presented for the biological sciences. The prevailing lack of support and encouragement for scientific research in Chile is discussed.</dc:description>
