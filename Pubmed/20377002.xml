<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Fractures of the distal end of the radius are very frequent in the orthopedist's practice. The anatomical reduction of the articular surface and the extra-articular alignment of the radius are extremely important to minimize complications. The purpose of the study is to make an arthroscopic diagnosis of the lesions associated to the distal radius and assist in the reduction of the distal radius fracture. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was conducted from March 2007 to February 2008. We performed 20 wrist arthroscopies in 20 patients with an intraarticular fracture of the distal end of the radius. They were classified according to Frykman's criteria. Patient age ranged from 17 to 67, with a mean of 38.7 +/- 15.9 years. 60% were males and 40% females; mean follow-up was 12 months; the chondral lesions were classified according to Outerbridge, the interosseous ligament lesions and the triangular fibrocartilage lesions, according to Palmer's criteria. We did articular debridement, radiofrequency chondroplasty, and assisted the fracture reduction. We used Henry's palmar approach and did open reduction and internal fixation with a T-shaped palmar plate and finally performed an arthroscopy to check the reduction. RESULTS 8 cases had chondral lesions (grades II to IV); 7 cases had lesion of the triangular fibrocartilage (central isolated ruptures, radial detachment of the triangular fibrocartilage from the sigmoid notch), 5 cases had lesion of the scapholunate ligament; one case had a lesion of the luno-pyramidal ligament, and in 6 cases no associated lesions were found; 8 cases had a single lesion and 6 cases had 2 to 3 concomitant lesions. Two patients had been lost at the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits; 35% of those that were followed-up had pain at 3 months (7 patients) and 15% at 6 months. Only 2 cases had scapholunate instability and only one case had distal radioulnar instability. CONCLUSIONS Arthroscopy has proven useful in identifying hidden lesions, assisting in fracture reduction and even treating the lesions found at the time of the diagnosis. Chondral lesions were the most frequent ones, followed by lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage; a close relation was found between the type of Frykman fracture and the associated lesion. Type 7 and 8 lesions were more frequently associated with chondral lesions and with a higher mean age. At the end of the follow-up period the scapholunate ligament lesions remained unstable. Chondral lesions were related with persistent pain at 3 months.</dc:description>
