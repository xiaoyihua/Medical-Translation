<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Increased cardiac mass, as well as reduced arterial distensibility, are well recognised independent cardiovascular risk factors. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the existence of early structural and/or functional alterations of the left ventricle (LV) and the aortic root in young people with optimal (O), normal (N) or normal-high (HN) blood pressure (BP). MATERIAL AND METHODS BP was recorded, and LV mass (LVM), LV function, and aortic distensibility (AD) were evaluated by echocardiogram in medical students. RESULTS The study included 754 students (271 males; 20.47±1.35 years old). According to their BP, 54% were classified as O, 32% N, and 14% HN. LVM index was higher in N (30.9±0.44g/m(2.7)), and HN (31.26±0.73g/m(2.7)) than O (28.39±0.29g/m(2.7), P&lt;.01). Corrected mean ventricular shortening was similar between O (99.8±0.8%) and N (99.2±1.1%, ns), but smaller in HN (95.4±1.9%, P&lt;.05). The e'/a' ratio used to evaluate LV diastolic function, was higher in O (2.18±0.03) compared to HN (2.03±0.06, P&lt;.03). AD was lower in HN (1.41±0.05mmHg/cm(3)/m(2)) compared to N (1.22±0.02mmHg/cm(3)/m(2), P&lt;.01) and O (1.14±0.01mmHg/cm(3)/m(2), P&lt;.01). CONCLUSIONS Those young individuals with an N and HN BP showed an increased LVM index with decreased LV function and AD; evidence that would probably allow us to early identify non-hypertensive subjects with an increased cardiovascular risk.</dc:description>
