<dc:description xml:lang="en">Suicide is conscious behavior leading to self-destruction. The intention to die is always present and the consequent death will be caused by the suicide victim. The main causes of suicide are mood disorders and particularly depression, although certain personality features (low self-esteem, hopelessness, introversion, neuroticism, etc.) and stress are considered to be predisposing factors. Suicidal behavior is therefore a routine part of emergency psychiatry. Consequently, evaluation of the parasuicidal patient is fundamental in emergency departments due to the potential seriousness of the phenomenon and the increase in the frequency of this type of behavior. Furthermore, evaluation is essential to provide a more optimal therapeutic approach and appropriate referral and to improve treatment compliance. Nursing interventions require specific care plans that allow patients to express themselves openly and to be met with an uncritical and empathetic response in order to improve their self-confidence and ability to cope with problems and reduce anxiety.</dc:description>
