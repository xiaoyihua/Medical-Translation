<dc:description xml:lang="en">The present work studied the effect of cold on oxygen consumption (OC) and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity (alpha-GPD) in heart mitochondria of hypothyroid rats (hypo) treated with T3, T4 or T4 plus Iopanoic Acid (IOP). 200 g male Wistar rats were made hypothyroid by 131I administration. Animals were injected s.c., in divided doses, for 10 days, with one of the following substances: T3, 300 ng/100 g BW/day; T4, 2 micrograms/100 g BW/day or T4 plus IOP, 5 mg/100 g BW/day, for 72 h preceding the experiment. One half of each group was housed in a cold room at 4 degrees C and the other at 22 degrees C, for 25 h, and thereafter decapitated. Heart mitochondria were isolated by routine methods. The OC was measured polarographically using L-malate, L-glutamate and malonate as substrates. Intramitochondrial alpha-GPD activity was measured by a microcolorimetric assay. The results from 16 or 20 rats/group (4 or 5 pools of 4 hearts each) were: In the rats kept at 22 degrees C the OC (in ng at. oxyg./min/mg prot.; State 3) in the hypo+T4 group was 69 +/- 10; in the rats treated with T4+IOP, 75 +/- 11 and in the hypo+T3, 102 +/- 5. When the animals were exposed to 4 degrees C no change was observed in the hypo+T4 and hypo+T4IOP groups. On the other hand, OC was significantly lower in the T3-treated animals (p less than 0.001, versus their controls at 22 degrees C). This group of rats did not survive when exposed to cold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
