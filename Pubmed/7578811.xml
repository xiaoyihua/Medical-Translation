<dc:description xml:lang="en">Patients with recurrent upper abdominal complaints and without peptic ulcer or definite evidence of organic disease have been labelled as suffering from nonulcer dyspepsia and included in the study. A total of 125 patients were studied and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed. Histology, urease rapid test and ELISA serology were done in order to detect Helicobacter pylori infection. Age groups were done. The most frequent endoscopic and histological finding was chronic gastritis in all age groups of patients. In patients under 30 years old, the highest rate of normal endoscopy was found. Chronic gastritis was associated with Helicobacter pylori infection in 89.8% of all patients. The highest rate of chronic gastritis non associated with Helicobacter pylori infection was found in the age group of patients younger than 30 years old. Other factors as biliary reflux, gastroduodenal dismotility, decreased pain tolerance or stress have been proposed to be the etiology of chronic gastritis in young patients.</dc:description>
