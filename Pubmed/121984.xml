<dc:description xml:lang="en">Based upon the fact that there is an increase of serum gastrin levels after vagotomy, the authors compare normal gastrin levels in non-operated dogs, with two series of dogs submitted to truncal and parietal cells vagotomy (PCV), respectively. The surgical technique, as well as the method of gastrin determination employed are described herein. Three series of 7 dogs each were compared. A: "Normal"(non-operated) dogs; B: Dogs with truncal vagotomy and C: Dogs with PCV. The results of Mean values and P for every series were as follows: Series A: Mean 26 +/- 15.0 pg/ml. Series B: Mean 110 +/- 51.6 pg/ml. Series C: Mean 17.4 +/- 12.9 pg/ml. The relation of P showed high significance (P = 0,0004) between A and B; ("normal" vs truncal); slight significance(P = 0,128) between A and C ("normal" vs PCV) and again high (P = 0,0002) between B and C (truncal vs PCV). It is concluded that the rise in serum gastrin levels in dogs submitted to truncal vagotomy are highly significant when are compared with those in "normal" dogs. Dogs submitted to PCV showed slight rises in serum gastrin levels, without statistic significance when are compared with "normal" dogs, strongly indicating the near-physiologic effects of the PCV on the serum gastrin levels.</dc:description>
