<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To analyze the relationship between synchronous lesions in patients with colorectal cancer and their prognostic value. PATIENTS AND METHODS We have retrospectively reviewed 369 patients with resected colorectal cancer. We compared the rate of apparently curative surgery, progression and tumoral relapse, development of extracolonic cancer and mortality between patients with and without synchronous cancer. Afterwards, we analyzed the same parameters in colorectal cancer with and without synchronous adenomas. Finally, we repeated the analysis after stratification of cancers in 2 groups according to pTNM staging: 0-I-II stage vs III-IV. RESULTS We found synchronous adenomas in 54.7% of our patients and synchronous cancers in 7.6%. Follow-up period of groups with and without synchronous lesions were: 70.8 +/- 22.9 and 67.2 +/- 24.5 months (p = 0.55) respectively. Synchronous cancers showed higher mortality: 35.7 vs. 14.4%: p = 0.006; OR = 3.31 (1.33-8.13), higher tumoral progression : 39.3 vs. 19.1%: p = 0.011; OR = 2.75 (1.14-6.56) and higher relapse rate: 10.7 vs. 3.5%: p = 0.096. Stratifying according to stage, patients with stage 0-I-II and synchronous cancer showed worse prognosis: mortality = 27.7 vs. 8.1%, p = 0.019; OR = 4.45 (1.2-15.1), tumoral progression = 27.8 vs. 8.5%, p = 0.02; OR = 4.12 (1.14-14.19), and extracolonic cancer = 16.7 vs. 6.4% p = 0.095. There were no statistical differences between cases with and without synchronous adenomas. CONCLUSIONS Synchronous cancers showed worse prognosis after resection, with higher rate of tumoral progression and mortality. This difference is focused on the cases diagnosed in stage 0-I-II, not being found in III-IV. The presence of synchronous adenomas doesn't influence prognosis.</dc:description>
