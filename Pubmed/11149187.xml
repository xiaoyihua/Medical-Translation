<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the reliability and validity of the instrument "FANTASTIC", when being applied to a sample of Mexican patients with high blood pressure. DESIGN Observational, prospective, longitudinal, descriptive. SETTING Unit of Family Medicine No. 91 Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social. PATIENTS 103 patients with hypertension on treatment, adults, non diabetics that knew to read and to write. INTERVENTIONS Was applied "FANTASTIC" instrument (that consists of 25 closed items on the lifestyle), translated to Spanish in versions of 3 and 5 answers, with an interval test-retest of 14 to 21 days. The average of the systolic arterial tension (SAT), diastolic (DAT) and half arterial tension (HAT) was calculated of the last 3 registrations of the clinical file, mass corporal index (MCI), waist/hip ratio (WHR), and fast glucaemia (FG) was measured. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS 66% was women. The correlation test-retest, in the version of five answer options was of 0.81 (p = 0.01) and among both versions of 0.91 (p = 0.01). They were not differences in the total qualification according to the sex. To more age, it was bigger qualification and smaller MCI and FG. Weak correlation was observed (not significant) among more total qualification and smaller DAT. There was negative correlation among more qualification in the nutrition domain and smaller MCI (p = 0.01), among more qualification in the domain of tobacco (smaller consumption) with smaller DAT (p = 0.05) and smaller HAT (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The consistency of the instrument is very good. Their content doesn't correlate specifically with the control indicators in hypertension.</dc:description>
