<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To investigate whether there is association between the rs20541 (R130Q) polymorphism in the IL-13 gene with disease susceptibility and clinical subsets in patients with elderly-associated inflammatory chronic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS 78 patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA), 174 with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), 90 elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA), and 465 healthy controls from the same geographic area were studied. The rs20541 (R130Q) polymorphism in the IL-13 gene was evaluated by PCR-RFLP. Circulating levels of IL-13 were measured by ELISA. RESULTS A higher frequency of the AA genotype [2.349 (0.994-5.554)], as well as the allele A [1.589 (1.085-2.328] and the A carriers [1.656 (1.021-2.686)] (p&lt;0.05) was observed in the GCA patients. No significant differences were observed in the PMR and EORA patients as compared with the healthy controls. Neither difference was observed among the different disease groups studied. In GCA patients, differences in the genotype were associated with a worse prognosis. In PMR patients, the AA genotype was associated with higher levels of serum IL-13 than the GA one. However, such an association was not detected for controls and the other disease groups. CONCLUSIONS GCA is more frequent in carriers of the rs20541 (R130Q) polymorphism in the IL-13 gene. The utility of this polymorphism to predict the GCA prognosis must be confirmed in studies with a higher number of patients.</dc:description>
