<dc:description xml:lang="en">Deltametrin is an effective but not well tolerated treatment of scabies. The association with piperonil-butoxide allows shorter treatment periods, thereby reducing its adverse effects. We used this combination in the treatment of 33 patients with active scabies. Two treatment modalities were used with four or five applications, during 7 or 8 days respectively and patients were assessed two weeks later. Treatment was effective and well tolerated in 32 of the 33 patients and no differences were observed between the two modalities. It is concluded that this is an effective therapy for scabies.</dc:description>
