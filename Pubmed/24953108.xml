<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Gastric cancer is one of the most lethal tumors in the Chilean population. AIM To report the results of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in advanced gastric cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Review of medical records of patients with locoregionally advanced gastric cancer, subjected to a curative resection and treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The treatment was based on the INT 0116/SWOG protocol, which includes 5-fuorouracil as a single agent. Patients were followed for a median of 58 months. RESULTS the records of 168 patients (99 men) treated between 2004 and 2011, were reviewed. Median survival was 41 months. Median lapses between surgery and onset of chemo and radiotherapy were 12 and 17 weeks, respectively. Overall three and five years survival was 53 and 41%, respectively. On multivariate analysis the factors associated with a lower survival were an antral location of the tumor, presence of signet ring cells and more than 15 involved lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS Three and five years survival of gastric cancer patients subjected to adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was 53 and 41% respectively. These results are similar to those reported elsewhere.</dc:description>
