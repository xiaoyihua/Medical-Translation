<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Mutations of forkhead-box-O1 (FOXO1) gene at locus 13q14.1 cause changes in biochemical parameters leading to premature aging. Protein FoxO1 participates in the regulation of biochemical pathways, including those influencing the regulation of lipid profile and glucose metabolism. These parameters are a risk factor for all-cause mortality in the elderly population. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between FOXO1 locus and metabolic-nutritional markers. MATERIAL AND METHODS Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs2721069, rs4943794 and rs7981045 were determined in 594 hospitalized elderly (65-99 years), patients consecutively admitted to a geriatric ward, and tested the association of FOXO1 variants with biological markers by the analyses of co-variance (ANCOVA) and by Genotype Score Model statistic. RESULTS The ANCOVA analysis, under different genetic models, revealed significant associations. In particular, assuming a dominant genetic model, a significant association with serum levels of fasting glucose was observed for rs2721069 (P=.034) and rs4943794 (P=.012). For rs4943794 a significant association assuming a free genetic model (P=.039) and an additive one (P=.012) was also observed. No significant relationship was observed between rs7981045 and the analyzed markers. The Genotype Score Model analysis confirmed a significant association between FOXO1 SNP and fasting glucose, taking the SNP rs2721069 and rs4943794 together (P=.048; β=3.198). CONCLUSIONS Aging is a complex process, resulting from the interaction between several factors, including environmental and genetic ones. Our findings suggest that FOXO1 locus may influence blood glucose levels in hospitalized older patients, thus being one of the genetic factors contributing to healthy aging.</dc:description>
