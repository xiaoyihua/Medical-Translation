<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The lack of recognition of the occupational etiology of some malignant tumors implies that the cost of their health care rests in the National Health System. The aim of our study is to estimate the job-related lung and bladder cancer in Spain in 2008 treated by the National Health System (NHS), as well as the medical costs derived from its treatment in the same year. METHODS Literature estimates of Attributable Fractions due to work were used to estimate the job-related cases treated. Medical costs for specialised care (outpatient and hospital admissions) are derived from the NHS cost accounts. Costs due to primary health care and pharmaceutical benefits are obtained from secondary sources. Figures were computed according to disease and sex. RESULTS A total of 10,652 NHS hospital discharges in 2008 were due to lung cancer and bladder cancer attributable to work (only 16 were recognized as professional the same year). The treatment of these cases cost to the NHS in 2008 almost 88 million euros, of which 61.2 million belong to lung cancer and 26.5 to the bladder. CONCLUSIONS The magnitude of lung and bladder cancer attributable to work in Spain is much higher than reflected in the official Registry of Occupational Diseases. It should be recognized as professional to activate appropriate prevention policies. The related health care expenditure, which is financed by the NHS, is quite significant.</dc:description>
