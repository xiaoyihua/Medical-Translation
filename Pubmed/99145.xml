<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thirty cases of hydrops fetalis were reviewed in the obstetrics hospital No. 2 of the Social Security, and were treated in the isoimmunization clinic. Important data were obtained from the analysis, the most outstanding was the fact that both the mother with previous pregnancies and incompatible Rh blood transfusions, cause the hemolytic diseases to the unborn product, which usually presents at birth a severe and clear hydrops fetalis. Previous care to delivery was of great help, specially spectrometric and photometric studies of the ammniotic fluid with purpose of following the evolution, and to evaluate the right moment to perform the intrauterine fetal transfusions, which at a certain stage may allow the fetus to grow more without important deterioration of its functions, thus avoiding lung problem in premature fetuses. This is the main reason for high mortality. Although if it is not applied at the right moment the results will be negative and it is frequent that the pregnancy ends in fetal deaths. In general, the high mortality index occurred in the products that showed severe hydrops fetalis, in spite of the fact that pre and post natal care, imply fetal problem. This is due to the prematurity as well as the pathological process to which they are submitted. It is also necessary to insist that in promptness to apply treatment in the neonatal period, will depend the life of these infants. This treatment is the responsibility of a whole specialized group that has the knowledge of the problems, such as obstetricians, pediatricians, biochemists, nurses and social workers, etc.</dc:description>
