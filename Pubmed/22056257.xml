<dc:description xml:lang="en">Atopy is almost always associated with an elevated immunoglobulin (Ig) E production. Omalizumab is a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody that is currently indicated for the treatment of cases of asthma that satisfy certain criteria. A number of studies have been published on the usefulness of omalizumab in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, and the results have been variable. We present our experience in the treatment of 9 patients with severe atopic dermatitis refractory to at least 2 systemic drugs. All patients reported a decrease in pruritus and an improvement in quality of life. Good control of the skin disease was achieved with omalizumab in monotherapy in 2 patients, and there was a slight improvement in the eczematous lesions in 4 patients. Those patients who also had asthma achieved good control of their respiratory symptoms and did not require additional therapy. Omalizumab is a well-tolerated and safe drug that can be useful for the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis refractory to other systemic therapies. This monoclonal anti-IgE antibody is a major therapeutic advance as it opens the door to the management of atopic dermatitis using systemic immunomodulating therapies.</dc:description>
