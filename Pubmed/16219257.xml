<dc:description xml:lang="en">Topiramate is a new generation, antiepileptic drug used for the treatment of persistent partial crises. To date no specific teratogenic effects have been reported in humans, but they have appeared in experimental animals. We present the case of a neonate whose mother suffered from partial epilepsy, which was treated with topiramate throughout pregnancy at doses of 300 mg per day. When the child was born agenesis of the right thumb, hypoplasia of the left thumb, and syndactylia of the second and third toes of the foot with agnesis of some phalanges, and hypoplasia of the right orbicular muscle in the mouth were observed. No etiologic cause was found. We discuss whether there could have been a causal relationship with topiramate monotherapy.</dc:description>
