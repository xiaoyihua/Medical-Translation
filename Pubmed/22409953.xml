<dc:description xml:lang="en">Intra-abdominal infections represent a large and wide group of diseases which include intra- and retro-peritoneal infections. Some of them could be defined as uncomplicated, where the infectious process is limited to the organ or tissue of origin (appendicitis, diverticulitis, cholecystitis…). Complications occur when the infection spreads to the peritoneum, triggering localised peritonitis and abdominal abscesses. Most intra-abdominal infections are due to perforation or inflammation of the intestinal wall. The microorganisms that cause these infections come from the gastrointestinal flora, and therefore produce polymicrobial infections mixed with a predominance of anaerobic bacteria. Microbiological diagnosis is essential to determine the aetiology and the susceptibility of antimicrobial agents of the microorganism involved, especially in nosocomial infections or in community infections in predisposed patients due to increasing bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents, multidrug resistance and fungal involvement. Despite the advances in microbiological diagnosis, in the case of intra-abdominal infections it still remains direct, being based on stains and cultures, the most notable progress is the introduction of mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) for the rapid identification of the pathogens involved. This review will provide recommendations on the collection, transport and microbiological processing of clinical specimens. Comments on the pathogenesis, clinical and microbiological diagnosis of peritonitis primary, secondary, tertiary and peritonitis (and other infections) associated with peritoneal dialysis, intra-abdominal abscesses (intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal and visceral), biliary tract infections, appendicitis and diverticulitis are also presented.</dc:description>
