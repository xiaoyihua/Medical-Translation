<dc:description xml:lang="en">Crohn's disease (CD) is often very difficult to treat. Almost ten years ago "biologic" agents were introduced in the armamentarium to control CD. Although there are many new drugs in the pipeline, only two antiTNF agents have been released to the market (infliximab and, recently, adalimumab) and probably in 2008 certolizumab will be approved. A review of available evidence suggests that the three antibodies are effective in the induction and maintenance of response, and (to a lesser extent) remission. Infliximab has been very useful in fistulizing disease, and preliminary data do suggest that adalimumab and certolizumab will be also. Cost and long-term safety limit the use of these agents in daily practice. To maximize benefits and minimize risks, good patient selection and strict adherence to Clinical Guidelines seem the key points. It has been suggested that these drugs should be used in early disease to avoid progression, but current data are very scarce to generalize this recommendation. In anycase, we think that the use of "biologics" will provoke a dramatic change in CD treatment in the next 10 years.</dc:description>
