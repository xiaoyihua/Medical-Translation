<dc:description xml:lang="en">This article summarizes findings from the 2007 registry of the Spanish Society of Cardiology Working Group on Cardiac Catheterization and Interventional Cardiology. Data were obtained from 129 hospitals that performed catheterization, mainly in adults: 74 public and 55 private. In 2007, 136 231 diagnostic procedures were performed; 122 260 were coronary angiograms, a 7.9% increase on 2006. The rate was 2725 angiograms per million inhabitants. There were also 60 457 percutaneous coronary interventions, 6% more than in 2006; the rate was 1347 per million inhabitants. Some 94 966 stents were implanted, 57.7% of which were drug-eluting. In addition, 11 322 interventions were carried out in acute myocardial infarctions, 12.5% more than in 2006. They accounted for 18.7% of all percutaneous coronary interventions. Noncoronary interventions were carried out most frequently for adult congenital heart disease, with closure of an atrial septal defect accounting for most procedures (i.e., 334). The most common valvular procedure was percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty, which was performed in 367 cases, with a success rate of 90.7%. This year saw the first percutaneous valve implantations in Spain and 18 prosthetic aortic or pulmonary valves were implanted. The proportion of procedures utilizing radial access increased to 40%, for both diagnostic and interventional procedures. The remarkably high level of participation by the different centers has ensured that the registry can serve an international reference source on catheterization in Spain.</dc:description>
