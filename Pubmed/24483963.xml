<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Obesity is a chronic disease whose prevalence is increasing up to be considered a real epidemic. In the case of morbid obesity, in many cases required to resort to surgery to achieve adequate weight reduction and improvement of comorbidities. There are, however, few studies have evaluated the influence of a structured program of physical exercise in these patients before surgery. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the influence of a structured program of physical exercise in morbidly obese patients awaiting bariatric surgery. METHOD Prospective intervention study in 10 patients (6 women and 4 men) morbidly obese bariatric surgery pending of 47.1 ± 4.6 years. Structured exercise program for 2 months (16 sessions) along with "food education". It was assessed before and after intervention anthropometric and body composition by bioelectrical impedance, fitness, food habits survey, physical activity, quality of life and satisfaction with the program. RESULTS Weight loss achieved after the program was 5.17 ± 4.01 kg and BMI of 1.77. There was also a favorable change in body composition with 1.77% increase of muscle mass and decrease of 2.83% and 1.43% in total fat mass and visceral, respectively. The distance traveled as an expression of the physical condition of the subjects improved significantly going from 586.72 ± 82.8 m to 625.59 ± 78.2 m. No significant differences in the assessment of quality of life, adherence to the program was 75% and the degree of satisfaction with it was very high. CONCLUSIONS A structured program of physical exercise in morbidly obese patients awaiting bariatric surgery helps in reducing weight and improving body composition while increasing fitness and is well accepted by patients, so it can be a part of the multidisciplinary approach to this disease.</dc:description>
