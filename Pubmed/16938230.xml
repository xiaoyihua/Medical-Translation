<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Low-dose aspirin is standard treatment for patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Its use in primary prevention is more controversial. However, recent studies also support the use of aspirin in high-risk individuals with no history of cardiovascular disease. This study investigated the health economic implications of using low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Spain. METHODS A model was developed to predict the cost-effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease over a period of 10 years. The direct costs used were those of the Spanish National Health Service (NHS). Results were expressed as cost per life-year gained and per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS Administering low-dose aspirin to an individual with a 10-year risk of coronary heart disease &gt; or =15% resulted in an average net saving of e 797 (95% CI, e 263-1331) over the 10-year period, with savings starting in the first year. For an annual risk &gt; or =0.24%, this form of treatment would reduce NHS costs. Treating all at-risk individuals in the Spanish population with aspirin would save e 26.5 million from the healthcare budget, starting in the first year. CONCLUSIONS Administering low-dose aspirin to individuals with a 10-year risk of coronary heart disease &gt; or =15% would result in significant cost savings for the Spanish NHS. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of these findings.</dc:description>
