<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate patient satisfaction with the ValCrònic program, telemedicine devices, and the results of the care received after a 2-year follow-up. DESIGN Observational, descriptive study based on telephone surveys. SETTING The autonomous community of Valencia (Spain). PARTICIPANTS Participants consisted of 410 patients with one or more of the following diseases: hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A total of 585 patients were included, of whom 104 left the program (18 due to death) and 71 refused to participate. METHODS We designed and validated a specific scale. Floor and ceiling effects were considered. Internal consistency was analyzed using Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS Responses were obtained from 322 patients (response rate, 78.5%). Of these, 118 (36.6%) were women. In 48 patients (14.9%), the person responding was a caregiver. Cronbach's alpha was 0.7. For 278 patients (86.3%), the ValCrònic program helped them to understand their disease better, 270 (83.9%) reported that it helped them use their medication more safely, and 283 (87.9%) reported they had better knowledge of their disease. For 288 (89.4%), the devices were easy to manage at home. Only 12 patients (3.7%) found that the devices involved a heavy workload that was difficult to incorporate into their daily lives. CONCLUSIONS The ValCrònic program promotes self-care among patients.</dc:description>
