<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION An incorrect transfer of patients to paediatric surgery clinic results in clinic saturation and both patient and medical staff discomfort. As a consequence the quality of medical care is deteriorated. AIM 1) To evaluate the transfer of new patients to paediatric surgery clinic from primary paediatric care considering the medical diagnosis and the surgical calendar, looking for the most common mistakes. 2) To analyze the inconvenience of a wrong indication for both our patients and the medical staff. 3) To propose new measures to decrease the rate of patients incorrectly transferred. MATERIAL AND METHOD An observational retrospective study was performed based on medical records of new patients evaluated in paediatric surgery clinic between september 2010 and january 2012. Age, address, diagnosis, transfer indication and referring centre were collected. RESULTS Two thousand four hundred thirty medical records were reviewed from new patients finding an incorrect transfer in 44.28% of them (2.37 children/day). From these cases wrong transfer was related to surgical calendar in 18.59% and wrong diagnosis in 81.41% of them. Most common mistakes due to wrong diagnosis were Phimosis (91.45% n= 113) and Cryptorquidism (85.29% n = 122); mistakes related to surgical calendar were Umbilical Hernia (88.46%), Hypospadias (72.22% n= 31) and Hydrocele (70.83% n = 12). Mean distance of transfer for patients wrongly referred outside the metropolitan area was 35.92 km (Range: 7.1-129). CONCLUSIONS We have detected major mistakes in patient transfer from primary paediatric care. The knowledge of surgical calendar and accurate diagnosis should avoid these problems. These mistakes result in deterioration of medical care quality, patient discomfort and clinic saturation. It is necessary to propose and develop measures that improve the knowledge of surgical calendar and to make more accurate surgical diagnosis in primary paediatric care.</dc:description>
