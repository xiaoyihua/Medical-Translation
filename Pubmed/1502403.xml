<dc:description xml:lang="en">We present our experience with oxygen-therapy with transtracheal catheter in the period between January 1990 and December 1991. This procedure was offered to 130 patients who met criteria of home oxygen-therapy being accepted only by twelve. Ten patients maintained oxygen-therapy with transtracheal catheter with excellent results and a notable improve in their quality of life. One patient died twenty-three days after beginning the procedure, due to evolution of main disease finding no role of the catheter in the disease. Another patient showed a vagal reaction after placement of the catheter, which forced to perform resuscitation with connection to mechanical ventilation taking the catheter off because familiar request. Patients who benefit this type of oxygen-therapy the trans-tracheal catheter has showed its usefulness. With few complications and showing no problems in its home handling. Oxygen savings with this technique have been of 55%. Trans-tracheal catheter was much more effective than face mask to correct desaturation after exercise (p less than 0.001).</dc:description>
