<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The current study was designed to determine the risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) after an isolated idiopathic optic neuritis (ON). PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively studied 28 patients (range from 18-45 years) who presented a unilateral acute ON between 1 st April and 31 st December. We excluded optic neuropathy of other causes, a previous diagnosis of MS or systemic diseases associated with ON. Patients underwent brain MRI, visual evoked potentials (VEPs), somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs). The mean interval between ON onset and MRI was 3.1 months. 24 patients were treated with corticosteroids in different ways: oral prednisone (14) and intravenous methylprednisolone (10). Mean duration of the follow-up was 4.5 years in 26 patients. RESULTS Brain MRI detected white matter areas with increased signal in 10 of 25 patients (40%). Eight (30%) had bilateral anormalities on VEP, while SEPs and BAEPs revealed anormalities in one patient (5.5%). Two out 26 patients (7.7%) developed CDMS; one was treated with oral prednisone and the other with intravenous corticosteroids. No patients with normal MRI developed MS compared to 20% of patients with lesions on initial brain MRI. The only patient with abnormal SEPs and BAEPs did not develop MS. CONCLUSIONS We found in our population low rate of developing CDMS with higher risk for those ON with abnormalities on initial brain MRI.</dc:description>
