<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To define the evolution of patients with infective endocarditis who require urgent valve replacement in our environment. PATIENTS AND METHODS We followed 45 consecutive cases of infective endocarditis that require valve replacement during their hospitalization. 32 patients had native valve infective endocarditis, 7 early prosthesis valve endocarditis and 6 late prosthesis valve endocarditis. Patients were followed for a long-term period, clinical and echocardiographycally. RESULTS In 39 cases valve replacement was performed before ending antibiotic therapy. The main indications for surgery were refractory heart failure (24 patients) and shock (11 patients). The mortality rate was 24%: 19% in native valve infective endocarditis, 43% in early prosthetic valve endocarditis and 33% in late prosthesis valve endocarditis. The first cause of death was septic shock (46%). We followed 31 over 34 survivors for a mean time 65 (DS 49) months. We found two relapses and six deaths (1 sudden death, 2 endocarditis) and 72% of patients presented class I NYHA. We detected 17% prosthetic leaks (34% in the prosthetic valve endocarditis group). CONCLUSIONS The need of urgent valve replacement in the context of infective endocarditis is associated with a high mortality rate, and should be considered a serious condition. Long term prognosis is, however, acceptable, although 17% of patients had prosthesis leak, specially those with prosthetic valve endocarditis.</dc:description>
