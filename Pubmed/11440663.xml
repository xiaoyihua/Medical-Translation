<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Genital infection is the most important cause of infertility worldwide, affecting not only Fallopian tubes but all anatomic urogenital sites, both male and female. METHODS We present a randomized,prospective and normalized study about sexually transmitted diseases(STD). We include 487 patients, 376 of whom were infertile and the remaining 111 were not and act as control group. RESULTS 47.3% of infertile patients showed at least one infection: 10.7% had Chlamydia trachomatis infection, whereas only 0.3% had gonococal infection. We found none syphilis. 12.9% of the patients showed yeast belonging to genus Candida, 5% bacterial vaginosis, 3.8% Escherichia coli and 0.3% Klebsiella pneumoniae. The percentage of isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis were 23.5% and 4.8%, respectively. We detected antibodies against Hepatitis B (any serological marker) in 7.8% of the cases. Chlamydial infection and the presence of U. urealyticum were related with infertility (X 12=6,070, p&lt;0.005 and X12=8,782, p&lt;0.005,respectively). CONCLUSIONS We think these results conclude that is necessary to perform routine tests to screen for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and for infections caused by micoplasma as well, among infertile patients. These patients must be considered of being at risk of acquiring STD, since the percentage of these diseases is higher than the percentage we found among the control group. It is important to insist on prevention and early diagnosis and treatment as a main goal to decrease the number of tubal occlusion and infertile couples.</dc:description>
