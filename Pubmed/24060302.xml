<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION To design and validate a simulator for learning and training in the capsulorhexis technique. METHODS The system consists of a methacrylate support inclined 15° for the surgeon's hand, an area of commercially available aluminum foil, and another one of similar characteristics, where the student performs the technique through some slots that are previously made in the support. In order to evaluate the feasibility of this simulator, data were collected from 65 ophthalmologists performing the technique during training activities. The ophthalmologists were randomly divided into one group of 30 specialists who start their learning on the eyes of an animal cadaver, and into another of 35 specialists who previously started with this simulator. RESULTS A simulator is developed for training in the capsulorhexis technique. The students from the simulator group achieved a reduction in the use of cadaver eyes, and a higher efficiency in correct capsulorhexis, unlike the group who started directly on the cadaver eyes. CONCLUSIONS This simulator is an innovation in training of the capsulorhexis technique as regards simplicity, cost, and reuse, as compared to other virtual simulators with more expensive computer equipment (CE) equipment that are more difficult to transport. It is an important step prior to the use of cadaver parts and experimental animals, decreasing the number of both, and therefore the teaching costs.</dc:description>
