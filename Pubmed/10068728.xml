<dc:description xml:lang="en">Oddi sphincter dysfunction is manifested as a biliary- or pancreatic-type pain syndrome. At present, imaging studies are not very trustworthy for the diagnosis of this dysfunction, because of which direct endoscopic manometry offers the gold standard for confirming or ratifying the problem, supported by the Milwaukee Biliary Classification. Currently, the endoscopic approach has become the most effective alternative used for this type of diagnosis. Among the techniques may be found the following: endoscopic sphincterotomy, balloon dilation, the placing of biliary endoprostheses, and the injection of botulinic toxin in the Oddi sphincter. In our modest and short experience with six patients, of which five corresponded to group I of the Milwaukee bile classification, the above patients were treated successfully with sphincterotomy. The other two patients belonged to group type III of the Milwaukee classification, and were treated with botulinic toxin until the moment of a satisfactory response, for a period of 8 months.</dc:description>
