<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to analyze the characteristics of patients with acute prostatitis presenting to the Emergency Department, the microbiological findings, antibiotic susceptibility, and bacteraemia associated factors. METHODS Observational and cohort study with prospective follow-up including patients with acute prostatitis presenting to the Emergency Department from January-December 2012. Data were collected for demographic variables, comorbidities, microbiological findings, antibiotic treatment and outcome. RESULTS Two hundred and forty one episodes of acute prostatitis were included. Mean age was 62.9 ± 16 years, a history of prostate adenoma was reported in 54 cases (22.5%) and prior manipulation of the lower urinary tract in 40 (17%). Mean symptoms duration was 3.38 ± 4.04 days, voiding symptoms were present in 176 cases (73%) and fever in 154 (64%). Seventy patients (29%) were admitted to the hospital and 3 died. From 216 urine cultures, 128 were positive (59%) and 24 (17.6%) out of 136 blood cultures. Escherichia coli was the main pathogen (58.6% of urine cultures and 64% of blood cultures) with resistant strains to fluoroquinolones, cotrimoxazole and amoxicillin/clavulanic in 27.7%, 22.9% and 27.7% of cases respectively. In the univariate analysis, only chills were associated to bacteraemia (p=0.013). At 30-day follow-up, patients with bacteraemia returned more frequently to the Emergency Department (p=0.037) and were more often admitted to the hospital (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS Patients with acute prostatitis discharged from the Emergency Department need clinical follow-up and monitoring of microbiological findings in order to assure an adequate antibiotic treatment. Return to Emergency Department and admission to the hospital were significantly more frequent among patients with bacteraemia.</dc:description>
