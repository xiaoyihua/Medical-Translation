<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Infectious diseases have traditionally been one of the leading causes of death in developed countries. The objectives of this research were to: 1) quantify the importance of infectious diseases as a cause of premature mortality in Spain between 1908 and 1995, and 2) determine the frequency and distribution of the infectious diseases with the greatest impact on premature death. METHODS The study was carried out based on data on mortality from infectious causes published by the National Institute of Statistics in the Movimiento natural de la población (Natural Movement of the Population) for the study period. Three indicators of premature mortality were used: the potential years of life lost (PYLL), the crude rate of PYLL per 1 000 population, and the percentage and the average of PYLL. RESULTS Between 1908 and 1995, the number and the rate of PYLL from infectious causes clearly declined. The decrease was more prominent starting in the 1950s, and it was seen in all age groups. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of premature death from the beginning of the century until the 1970s, but after that, the leading causes became pneumonia and AIDS. CONCLUSIONS The impact of infectious diseases as determinants of premature death in Spain declined during the 20th century, especially starting in the 1970s.</dc:description>
