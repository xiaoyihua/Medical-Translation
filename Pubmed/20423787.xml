<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Cystic lesions of the spleen are uncommon, and can be classified according to their histological findings in true cysts and secondary cysts or pseudocysts. Frequently, splenic pseudocysts are secondary to trauma, infection or splenic infarcts. The clinical presentation is variable and may be asymptomatic or usually the symptoms are related to compression of adjacent organs. The case of a 14-year-old female with a history of having a fall from a height of 50 cm with a direct trauma in the left lumbar region 3 years ago is presented. She was asymptomatic until one month before going to consultation when she had a minor trauma (a fall from her own height) and a volume increase was detected in the upper left abdominal quadrant. Physical examination revealed splenomegaly 8 cm below the ridge rib and pain was induced after deep palpation. omputed tomography showed a 12 x 10 x 8 cm cystic lesion in the upper splenic pole. Laparotomy and splenectomy was performed. The histological analysis showed that the cyst wall consisted of dense collagen without epithelial lining. Currently the patient is asymptomatic.</dc:description>
