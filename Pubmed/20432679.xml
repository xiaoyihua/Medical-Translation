<dc:description xml:lang="en">The thoracic pain is a symptom that produces great alarm in whom it suffers since is linked culturally to a cardiac origin that can put in risk the life. How ever, only a third of the patients who come to urgencies with thoracic pain have a cardiac pathology. Diverse reasons can produce thoracic not cardiac pain being necessary more studies for this pain for its better knowledge. The frequency of the thoracic not cardiac pain has not been evaluated well, existing only a population study in the world and the study realized by us in Spain, of which we offer some results. The preliminary conclusions of our study are: 1) The prevalence of thoracic pain in the Spanish population is 12.3%, 2) 42% consults the doctor, 3) 5,7% has stopped working some day for it, 4) the presence of thoracic pain associated to CV deterioration, so much in the spheres physical as mentally, and 5) the thoracic pain associated with a major prevalence of associated anxiety and depression.</dc:description>
