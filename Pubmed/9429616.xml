<dc:description xml:lang="en">Earthworms (Eisenia fetida and Lumbricus rubellus) were ensiled with ground sorghum and molasses in the following proportions: 1) 60% earthworms, 40% sorghum; 2) 60% earthworms, 40% sorghum, adjusting pH to 4.0 with HCl; 3) 60% earthworms, 20% sorghum, 20% molasses; 4) 60% earthworms, 20% sorghum, 20% molasses, adjusting pH to 4.0 with HCl. These mixtures were allowed to ferment for 15 days at 18 degrees C. pH, proximate chemical analyses, digestible protein, true protein, ammonia nitrogen, acetic, propionic and butyric acid, lactic acid and gross energy were analyzed in the ensiled mixtures. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and orthogonal contrasts. No differences (P &gt; 0.0001) were found in the percentage of moisture, ether extract, crude fiber and crude protein (52.22, 2.96, 1.15, 22.00, 51.76, 3.48, 1.28, 20.17; 53.89, 3.23, 0.95, 20.63; 54.87, 2.99, 1.03, 21.14, for treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Neither there was any difference (P &gt; 0.0001) for true protein and gross energy (7.57, 4.37; 6.92, 4.41; 5.45, 4.37; 6.38, 4.30, for treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Ash content (P &lt; 0.0001) and nitrogen free extract (p &lt; 0.02) were different between treatments with sorghum and treatments with sorghum and molasses (3.80, 70.09; 3.60, 71.47; 6.08, 69.11; 6.63, 68.21, for treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Digestible protein was also different (P &lt; 0.01) for treatment 1 (96.78) than 2 (94.34). pH values were lower (P &lt; 0.03) for treatment 2 (3.80) and 4 (3.76), where HCl was added than for 1 (4.06) and 3 (4.16). Ammonia nitrogen values were very low for all treatments. Lactic:acetic acid ratio was large for all treatments (7.55, 14.83, 8.30, 7.63 for treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). It is concluded that it is possible to preserve the earthworms E. fetida and L. rubellus by ensiling, adding a source of carbohydrates, such as sorghum or molasses. Not being necessary the addition of acids to have an adequate fermentation.</dc:description>
