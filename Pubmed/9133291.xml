<dc:description xml:lang="en">The fourth period, which can be defined as the period of specialized publications, commenced with the founding of the Asociación Española de Urología (Spanish Urological Society) in 1911. As in other European countries, the expressions 'Genitourinary Disorders' or 'Genitourinary Organs' were replaced and all publications dealing with the genitourinary tract, its disorders or their surgical management, adopted the generic term 'Urology', although the terms relating to other specialties were retained. From 1924 until the Spanish Civil War in 1936, there was always a representative and official journal of the Asociación Española de Urología. Fifteen new journals, which are analyzed in the present article, were published during this long and fruitful period abruptly broken by the Spanish Civil War. This period culminated in 1977, when Actas Urológicas Españolas, the official journal of the Society, was established. Most of the journals of this last period have disappeared, but some have endured, like Archivos Españoles de Urología, which is now in its 50th year. Despite the formidable and sustained competition of the foreign specialized journals, their activity continues with the same vigour that denotes the perseverance, thrust and intellectual vitality of Spanish urologists who have unfalteringly supported these publications. In my view, Spanish urological publications have a brilliant and enduring future.</dc:description>
