<dc:description xml:lang="en">The presence of HI antibodies for the Eastern, Western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis was investigated in 16,405 human sera collected in 47 communities in the Mexican Republic. It was found that there is a high percentage of individuals who have antibodies against Venezuelan equine encephalitis. In turn, it was discovered that persons with Western equine encephalitis virus antibodies live in the northwestern states of the country. Very few cases with Eastern equine encephalitis antibodies were detected.</dc:description>
