<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM Left ventricle impairment is very common in acromegaly. Concentric hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction are observed at an early stage. Late left ventricle dilatation with systolic dysfunction may appear. Few reports have studied right ventricle diastolic function. METHODS Twenty-seven acromegalic patients were included. Biventricular diastolic function was assessed using Doppler-echocardiography. Possible associations with hormonal activity, evolution time of illness, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic impairment on echocardiography were studied. RESULTS Fifteen patients showed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, whereas thirteen patients showed right ventricular diastolic dysfunction. A good correlation was observed between E/A relation of both ventricles (r = 0.70; p &lt; 0.01) and isovolumetric relaxation time (r = -0.60; p &lt; 0.01). The right ventricular E/A relation correlated with left ventricular mass index and significance was almost achieved with the presence of hypertension. There was no statistical correlations between the right ventricular E/A relation and hormone values or evolution time of illness. The left ventricular E/A relation showed a significant association with left ventricular mass index, isovolumetric time index and evolution time of illness. There were no statistical association with hormone values. CONCLUSIONS The high prevalence of right ventricular diastolic dysfunction observed in acromegaly suggests the presence of acromegalic myocardiopathy.</dc:description>
