<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of dysphagia in a population of institutionalised elderly people, and the effectiveness of a clinical method for its detection. METHODOLOGY A prospective study was conducted on a random sample of elderly residents. A clinical evaluation along with an assessment with different volumes and viscosities (MECVV) were used. Specific care and follow up was arranged following this assessment. RESULTS Forty residents were studied. The prevalence of unrecognised dysphagia was 42.5%. Following assessment by the MECVV, the prevalence rose from 22.5% to 65% (P=.012). Dysphagia detected by MECVV was related to nutritional risk, as measured by the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) (P=.007), and to the diagnosis of dementia (P=.028). CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of dysphagia in this sample of institutionalised elderly people increases when applying a clinical method for detection, reaching a prevalence similar to other studies.</dc:description>
