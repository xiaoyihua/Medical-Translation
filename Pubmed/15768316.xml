<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION This study evaluates the presentation of different psychiatric pathologies secondary to traumatic injuries; assessing the presentation frequency and how it correlates with whether it is a brain injury (TBI) or one in a different corporal area. METHODS The study group consisted of 249 patients, 122 with TBI and 127 with injuries from different body areas. The patients conditions were evaluated at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after the traumatic episode. Psychiatric diagnosis was made using a structured clinical interview and DSM-IV criteria. RESULTS Depressive and anxiety disorders were observed in frequencies similar to previous reports; without significant differences between TBI and non-TBI groups. The organic change of personality was significantly more frequent among patients with TBI than among the non-TBI with apathy features. There was a significant decrease in quality of life one year after the traumatism in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Psychiatric disease is a frequent complication of injured patients; and it is associated with deterioration of general health and quality of life. TBI patients have more probability of developing an organic change of personality.</dc:description>
