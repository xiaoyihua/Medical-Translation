<dc:description xml:lang="en">Clinical records of 181 children, aged between one month and seven years, admitted in a four year period, from 1978 through 1982, with the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis are revised. Peak incidence occurred in the age group between six months and three years, and during the months of January to May. N. meningitidis (35%), pneumococcus (4.9%) and H. influenzae (2.7%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria. CSF culture was negative in 56% of the children. All of them had previously taken antibiotics. Complications were present in 6.4%, with highest incidence in the known-agent group, on the following order: septic shock, 11%, seizures, 6.6%, and subdural effusion, 2.2%. Permanent sequelae were present in 3.8%, being deafness predominant. Twelve (6.3%) out of the 181 died, and death was result of fulminant meningococcal sepsis with endotoxic shock in ten of these patients. Clinical and psychological followed-up of twenty-nine children with isolated causal agent, were compared with a control group, finding no statistically-significant difference.</dc:description>
