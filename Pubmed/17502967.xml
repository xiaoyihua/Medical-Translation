<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Evaluating the frequency of mycobacterium infection in an HIV-positive population and its influence on medium-term survival, along with clinical and epidemiological factors associated with co-infection. METHODS Several clinical specimens were studied for mycobacteria in a sample of 92 HIV+ patients at the San Juan de Dios teaching-hospital in Bogota, Colombia, during 1996. Factors associated with infection were measured using a prevalence ratio (PR), CI=95%, and logistic regression was used in the multivariable models. The likelihood of survival for three months was measured using Kaplan-Meir curves and factors associated with survival were assessed using Rate ratios and Cox's model. RESULTS Eight percent of the patients had tuberculosis and 6% of them were found to be infected with atypical mycobacterium. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was the most frequent species, followed by M. fortuitum and M. chelonae. Mixed infections with M. tuberculosis and MAC were diagnosed in one patient and two different species of atypical mycobacterium were isolated in other two cases. Patients suffering from tuberculosis and stages III or IV HIV infection had a 16% survival rate. CONCLUSIONS Tuberculosis-HIV/AIDS frequency and atypical Mycobacterium-HIV/AIDS' association were very similar. The most frequently isolated atypical mycobacterium specie in this study was MAC. Survival rate was lower for patients infected by M. tuberculosis and even lower when a multi-resistant strain was involved. The most important clinical factor associated with M. tuberculosis was the presence of fever and loss of weight with mycobacterial infection. Blood provided the best samples for isolating mycobacteria.</dc:description>
