<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION New antipsychotics are associated with fewer adverse effects than classical ones. However, an increase in the patient's quality of life is not clear, given the complex relationship between quality of life and schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE To show there are no real differences in adverse effects and quality of life of schizophrenic patients treated with atypical and typical neuroleptics. METHODS Transversal study. The sample (78 male and female patients between 18 and 80 years old) was divided into three treatment groups: atypical, typical and both kinds of neuroleptics. Measurement instruments used were Udvalg Für Kliniske Undersogesler (UKU) for adverse effects and Quality of Life Scale (QLS) for quality of life. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Treatment with atypical antipsychotic is significantly associated with fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects but not with a better quality of life in the scales applied. Probably quality of life does not only depend on treatment. It may also be affected by other several factors such as negative symptomatology and a long-term evolution of schizophrenia, which are not included in the quality of life scales used. However, this is a pilot study, in which we have used only a quality of life scale and a small sample chosen without previous sample calculus. Taking this into account, general conclusions on efficacy and global acceptance of antipsychotics cannot be deduced.</dc:description>
