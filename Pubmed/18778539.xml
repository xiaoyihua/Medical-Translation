<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas represent between 5% and 10% of all pancreatic tumors. Due to their malignant potential, surgery is indicated. Because of the uncommon nature of this pathology, the aim of this study was to present a series of six patients who were operated on for a cystic tumor and to analyze the morphological characteristics, surgical experience and follow-up. METHODS This was a retrospective study. Clinical files were studied, as well as surgical and pathological registries from patients diagnosed with cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Five females and one male were included with a mean age of 54 +/- 15 years. The main symptom was abdominal pain. RESULTS Clinical course and CT scan results were the criteria for suspecting the diagnosis. In 4/6 patients, the tumor was located within the body and tail of the pancreas. The most frequent intervention was distal pancreatectomy. There was no mediate operative mortality in a 30-day period. Histopathological diagnoses were three serum cystadenomas, two mucinous cystadenomas and one cystadenocarcinoma. After a 4-year follow-up, no tumor recurrences have been reported in the surviving patients. CONCLUSIONS The natural history of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas is generally benign, but complications may occur by direct invasion of neighboring structures. Clinical course, tomography, pancreatography and punction are fundamental for its treatment.</dc:description>
