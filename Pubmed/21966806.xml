<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Embryo transfer is a critical point for success in IVF cycles. Many factors should be considered when performing an embryo transfer such as: embryo quality and number, soft versus rigid catheter, easy of the transfer, physician technique, ultrasound guide during transfer, among others. OBJECTIVE Evaluate two different embryo transfer systems performed by six physicians with the same protocol. MATERIAL AND METHODS We evaluated 308 embryo transfers performed from January 2006 to December 2008 by six physicians with two different systems. We only included patients with good quality in embryos and endometrium. Both systems were analyzed in each of the six physicians. RESULTS Similar characteristics in number of transferred embryos, number of cells in each embryo and quality of them, were found in both groups. There were no significant differences between both systems in the characteristics of the couple nor the mentioned above. Most of the transfers n = 252 (81.81%), were realized by two of the six physicians, however, the pregnancy rate did not show significant differences between these physicians and the less experienced ones. CONCLUSIONS With the obtained results, it could be supposed that the most influential factor in the outcome is the operator experience in the use of each system and not the system itself.</dc:description>
