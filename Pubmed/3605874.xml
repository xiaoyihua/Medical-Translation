<dc:description xml:lang="en">Maternal, perinatal and neonatal factors of 27 newborns of heroin addicted mothers were reviewed between 1980 and 1984. Results were compared with a control group of 2,587 normal newborns. A progressive increase in number of cases was observed in the last years. Mean age of heroin-addicted mothers was significant lower than control group (p less than 0.001). Only 18.5% were under obstetrical control for at least 4 times (p less than 0.001) and 40.7% had antecedents previous abortions (p less than 0.025). Four cases of maternal syphilis were diagnosed and also four mother were positive to HBsAg; statistical difference in both cases was highly significant with respect to control group (p less than 0.001). A higher index of premature rupture of membranes (11.1%, p less than 0.001) and cesarean sections (25.9%, p less than 0.001) was appreciated. No significant difference was observed attending to fetal presentation, instrumental delivery, Apgar test scores and pH of umbilical artery (p greater than 0.05). A higher incidence of preterm (18.5%, p less than 0.01) and small for gestational age babies (44.4%, p less than 0.001) was ascertained. Pregnancy control and no smoking habit might influence birth weight (p less than 0.001). Neonatal withdrawal syndrome was present in 44.4% and was related to mother's last dose and secondary to degree of heroin abuse (p less than 0.025).</dc:description>
