<dc:description xml:lang="en">The major initial clinical, hematological and cytogenetical features of a series of 80 patients with blastic crisis (BC) in chronic myelocytic leukemia with positive Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) were evaluated, and also were their outcome and response to therapy. Mean age of patients was 45 years (SD: 14.3). Ten patients fulfilled the criteria for initial BC, and 14 had extramedullary blastic infiltration. In one third there was an acceleration phase before the development of BC. The mean leukocyte count was 69 (SD 75) X 10(9)/l. In 40% there was anemia with hemoglobin less than 90 g/l, and 37.5% had thrombopenia with less than 100 X 10(9) cells/l. In most patients, serum lactic dehydrogenase activity was increased, and in one fourth the index of granulocyte alkaline phosphatase was high. In 9 patients, blast cells had a lymphoid phenotype and in 47 (59%) cytogenetic abnormalities in addition to Ph chromosome were found, usually consisting of 8 trisomy, duplication of Ph chromosome, and the presence of a 17q isochromosome. The median survival of the series was 4.8 months. When analyzed as a time-dependent variable, the achievement of a favorable therapeutic response (found in 26% of patients) was associated with a longer survival.</dc:description>
