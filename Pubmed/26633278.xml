<dc:description xml:lang="en">In Chile the only requirement to study medicine is to obtain an academic achievement score over a certain cutoff value. However, the literature states that this type of selection is insufficient, since the medical profession requires cognitive and non-cognitive skills. These abilities are associated with better adaptation and academic success, as well as less dropping out. Therefore, those skills should be considered in the selection process to assure that the education goals are met. The aim of this study was to review the existing literature regarding the selection and evaluation criteria for students who are applying to medical schools. It was evident that Chilean medical schools need to establish appropriate criteria to ensure a more inclusive and fair admission. They need to design a system of admission with solid evidence of validity and reliability, complementary to the current form of student selection. This system should be considered common to all schools of medicine and, in turn, consider the sensibilities of the particular mission of each school, since academic, cognitive, inter- and intrapersonal aspects may vary among them.</dc:description>
