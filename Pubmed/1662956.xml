<dc:description xml:lang="en">Virus isolation tests were performed on a group of 163 students who received prenatal care at the Student Medical and Dental Service at the University of Chile (Santiago) during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy to determine the possible existence of genital herpes infection (isolation from vaginal secretions) or cytomegalovirus infection (isolation from urine). The samples were inoculated on cell cultures and were then studied using immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) was detected in the vaginal secretions of 5 pregnant women, only one of whom had herpes lesions; in all these cases, the virus isolated was HSV type 2. Cytomegalovirus was detected in 7 of the pregnant women.</dc:description>
