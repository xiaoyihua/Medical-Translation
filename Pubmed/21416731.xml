<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To analyze the evolution of respiratory pattern variables (some of which are representative of central respiratory regulation) in a group of highly trained cyclists through a training season. MATERIAL AND METHODS Ten elite cyclists performed three maximal effort tests on a cicloergometer at November (preparatory period), February (precompetitive period) and June (competitive period). These three moments determine the start and end of two main training periods, during which training volume and intensity was monitored. Load (W), heart rate (HR), and oxygen uptake (VO2) was determined at the ventilatory thresholds and the maximum VO2. The relationship between tidal volume and inspiratory time (V(T)/t(I)) was studied in three zones: V(T)/t(I) under 2; 2) V(T)/t(I) between 2 and 4; and 3) V(T)/t(I) over 4. RESULTS Volume and intensity of training significantly increased in the second period of training, but the ventilatory thresholds and VO2 did not perform after the second visit to the laboratory. V(T) did not change in any of the studied zones during the season. The only differences observed were for t(I), between the first and second visit to the lab, for the first zone determined. The V(T)/t(I) relation did not change through the season. CONCLUSION There are no differences due to training in the measured variables in highly trained subjects. Changes in VO(2) and ventilatory thresholds after the first visit can not be attributed to the studied variables of the respiratory pattern of the subjects.</dc:description>
