<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The esophageal pH monitoring is the most sensitive method to diagnose gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, there is a significant number of patients who do not require this test. Recently, guidelines for the appropriate use of pH monitoring have been published. AIM To study the indications for the use of esophageal pH monitoring and to compare these indications with the guidelines published by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). METHODS Seventy-five files of patients submitted to esophageal pH monitoring from February 1997 to July 1997 were reviewed. The clinical indications of this test were defined by history and endoscopic findings. These indications were compared with the AGA guidelines. RESULTS In 50 cases (67%) the indications for esophageal pH monitoring were performed according to AGA's guidelines, in 15 (20%) the indications of pH monitoring did not follow these guidelines and in ten cases (13%), the indication could not be determined. The most frequent indications were: 1) diagnosis of GERD in patients with a negative endoscopy; 2) detection of GERD in patients with extraesophageal manifestations; 3) refractory symptoms of GERD to proton pump inhibitors; 4) evaluation of GERD after antireflux surgery; and 5) assessment of non-cardiac chest pain. In 11 cases (15%), the indications for the use of pH monitoring was erroneous. CONCLUSIONS In our motility laboratory, the majority of indications for esophageal pH monitoring were consistent with the AGA's guidelines. However, in 15% of the cases the pH monitoring was erroneously indicated.</dc:description>
