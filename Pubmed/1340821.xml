<dc:description xml:lang="en">The present study is a retrospective analysis of the endoscopic and histologic features of 728 polyps resected from 422 patients during the years 1980 to 1991. Mean age of the patients was 52 years (5 to 87), 63% male and 37% female. The histology of the lesions showed: adenoma: 60.3%, hyperplastic: 31.7; juvenile: 2.3% and miscellaneous: 5.7%. The 439 adenomas where found in 270 patients of which 151 (55.9%) were male and 119 (44.1%) female. The 231 hyperplastic polyps where found in 113 patients: 66 (58.4) male and 47 (41.6) female. All the hyperplastic polyps where less than 20 mm in diameter. Of the adenomas, 385 (87.7%) where less than 20 mm in diameter and had macroscopic appearance similar to the hyperplastic polyps. Of the 439 adenomas, 218 (49.6) where pediculated and 221 (50.4%) sessile. Of the hyperplastic polyps 53 (22.9%) where pediculated and 178 (77%) sessile. Of the adenomas, 351 (80%) where tubular and 88 (22%) had a villous component, most of the tubular adenomas where less than 15 mm in diameter and the villous component was more frequent as the polyps increased in size. Of the adenomas, 139 (30%) had dysplasia and of these 10% had cancer which represents a total of 3% of all the adenomas in this series. The grade of dysplasia was more severe as the adenomas was larger in size or had villous component. The polyps were located: 69.6 in the distal colon at the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscope and 30.4% in the proximal colon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
