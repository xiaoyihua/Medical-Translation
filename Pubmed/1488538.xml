<dc:description xml:lang="en">300 cases admitted in a hospital Emergency Unit are studied, corresponding to two weeks of June 1989, with the aim to know user's characteristics and pathology shown. Through a survey addressed to the patient, or person accompanying him/her, it is intended to know the reasons which motivated the election of this type of service. Predominant pathology is the one which groups lesions and adverse effects (52%) and are younger age groups the ones who consult more frequently. Most part of patient (80%) show up with no previous inform or document and 89% of admitted patients were sent to their homes. Geographical proximity explains in most cases the election of the Emergency Unit. Reasons vary according to age, diagnostic and different circumstances. For example during morning hours, and among patients who attend based on their initiative, "familiarity" is the most important reason to adopt the decision to attend Emergency Unit.</dc:description>
