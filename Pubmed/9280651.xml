<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In spite of advances in the prevention and treatment of ischemic vascular disease, this continues to be one of the main causes of disablement and prolonged hospitalization in developed countries. Also, hospitalization itself leads to complications which have a negative effect on the morbi-mortality of these patients during the time spent in hospital. OBJECTIVE We decided to study the effect of systemic complications during the period of hospital stay, on the functional recovery of patients which ictusl. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective study was made of 47 patients admitted to our unit for neurological deficit of more than 24 hours evolution and of cerebrovascular aetiology. Functional recovery was evaluated by means of the index of Barthel on discharge and after a period of 3 months with respect to the degree of neurological involvement (Canadian scale on admission), glycemia on admission, time spent in hospital and the occurrence of systemic complications in hospital. RESULTS These were no differences between the groups of patients with and without systemic complications regarding age, glycemia and Canadian scale on admission. Nor wes there any difference between the groups regarding the number of patients with significant deterioration of their neurological condition (decrease &gt; 20% in the EC). Functional recovery on hospital discharge was worse in the group with systemic complications (IB: 43.05 +/- 34.1: as compared with IB: 72.8 +/- 22.7 in the group without complications). This difference persisted after 3 months. CONCLUSIONS Systemic complications related to hospitalization have a negative effect on the functional recovery of patient with ictus and also prolong the time spent in hospital.</dc:description>
