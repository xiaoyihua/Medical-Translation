<dc:description xml:lang="en">(Eriomys lanigera y brevicaudata) Food value and acceptability of chinchilla's meat with different thermic treatments were studied. Chinchilla's in captivity of the Province of Jujuy were used. They were divided into three groups: raw and treated with dry and wet heat and the following analysis were carried out: moisture, protein, ether extract, ashes, iron (A.O.A.C.), cholesterol (enzymatic method), Net Protein Ratio (NPR), Digestibility and acceptability tests were also done. Moisture content of raw chinchilla's meat was 68.24 g/100 g and the meat treated with wet and dry heat had moisture of 65.09 g and 62.49 g/100 g respectively. Protein percentage of raw chinchilla's meat was 20.03 g/100 g, no significant differences were observed in the meat thermally treated. The same tendency was observed concerning the ether extract content (11.26; 12.00 and 12.92 g/100 g for raw meat and the one treated with wet and dry heat respectively). No difference was observed among the three types of meat as far as the ash content is concerned. The mg of iron in raw meat were higher (13.76 mg/100 g) than in thermally treated meat (12.43 and 12.37 mg/100 g for wet and dry heated respectively). NPR and digestibility of thermally treated meat were 5.26 and 5.65; 96.75 and 96.84 (for wet and dry heated meat respectively); both were similar to and higher than casein. The acceptability of chinchilla's meat treated with wet heat (94%) was higher than that treated with dry heat (90%). It can be concluded that chinchilla's meat thermally treated has both good food value and acceptability.</dc:description>
