<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To determine if the lyophilized aqueous extract of Geranium ayavacense (Pasuchaca) has any effect on glycemia in rats with experimental diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental diabetes was induced with alloxan. Rats included in the study met the following criteria: glycemia greater than 200 mg/dL post administration of alloxan, and with a weight greater than 200 g. Rats with experimental diabetes were divided into six groups of eight rats each. Group I received 3 mL of distilled water (control); group II received Geranium ayavacense 12.7 mg/kg; group III received Geranium ayavacense 100 mg/kg; group IV received Geranium ayavacense 200 mg/kg; group V received Geranium ayavacense 300 mg/kg; group VI received Geranium ayavacense 500 mg/kg. Basal glycemia was determined. Glycemia evaluations were performed at the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th and 24th hour after administrating the different interventions. RESULTS Geranium ayavacense groups of 300 and 500 mg/kg decreased glycemia significantly (p &lt;0.01) in every hour assessed after administration of the extract, when compared with the control group. Geranium ayavacense group of 300 mg/kg decreased their blood glucose 8.14; 10.68; 14.87; 19.36 and 23.7% in the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th and 24th hour respectively. CONCLUSIONS Under experimental conditions, the aqueous extract of Geranium ayavacense has hypoglycemic effects in rats.</dc:description>
