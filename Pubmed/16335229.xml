<dc:description xml:lang="en">Developing countries diets are based on a variety of plant foods that often are the main suppliers of important amounts of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). The objectives of this study were 1) to measure the total and dialyzable amounts of Fe and Zn in foods from Northern Mexico (Sonora) and from Southern Mexico (Oaxaca) and 2) to evaluate the effect of meat content of diets on the dialyzable amount of Fe and Zn. Methods to calculate the total dialyzable amount of Fe and Zn, were those of the AOAC and of Shen et al. Total Fe in e northern Mexican foods went from 0.78 +/- 0.0 to 11.59 +/- to 0.03 mg/ 100g (dry weight, DW); in southern Mexican foods the same micronutrient amounts were 0.86 +/- 0.18 to 8.8 +/- 0.57 mg/100 g (BS). Total Zn values were 0.91 +/- 0.00 to 13.58 +/- 0.05 mg/100 g (DW) in Sonora, and 0.64 +/- 0.18 to 20.80 +/- 0.33 mg/100 g (DW) in Oaxaca. In northern Mexico, foods dialyzable Fe had values from 0.1 +/- 0.04% to 10.6 +/- 0.36% and for Zn from 4.0 +/- 0.21% to 55.32 +/- 0.14%. Meanwhile, the range of values of dialyzable Fe for foods from Oaxaca were from 0.22 +/- 0.06% to 9.40 +/- 0.14% for and from 2.41 +/- 0.26% to 54.27 +/- 1.49% for dialyzable Zn. The average value for dialyzable Fe was higher in the foods that contained meat or meat products (p= 0.001).</dc:description>
