<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine the procedure characteristics of ERCP, indications and frequency of complications, as well as analyzing the associated risk factors. METHODS ERCPs carried out from January 1998 to December 2000 in the Gastroenterology Service of Daniel Alcides Carri n Hospital were evaluated retrospectively; 17 risk factors were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 202 ERCPs were carried out in 182 patients, of which 70.3% were patients aged under 60 years and 66.5% were female patients. The most frequent indication was bile duct stone suspect (59.4%). Therapeutic ERCPs were carried out in 49.5% of total ERCPs, diagnostic ERCPs were 33.2%, and failure ERCPs 17.3%. Post-ERCP complications occurred in 5.9% (12 cases), and the most frequent were: acute pancreatitis 3.4% and hemorrhage 1%. There was no mortality case related with complications. A risk factor related with the procedure: pancreatic cannulation or pancreatic contrast injections reached the highest statistic significance (p= 0.063). Therapeutic or failed ERCPs presented significant higher frequency of complications than diagnostic ERCPs: (p=0.0085 and p=0.0381). CONCLUSIONS the frequency of early post-ERCP complications is 5.9%, and has a direct relation with therapeutic or failed ERCPs. This marks a difference with regards to diagnostic ERCPs. There was no mortality, and pancreatic cannulation or pancreatic contrast injections would be able to determine the development of complications.</dc:description>
