<dc:description xml:lang="en">Within the genus Nocardia three species are at present considered to have human pathologic interest: N. asteroides, N. brasiliensis, and N. caviae. These species are usually the etiologic agents of at least two clinical pictures: nocardiosis and actinomycetoma. A case of pulmonar nocardiosis in a 62-year-old male is reported. The patient had asthmatic episodes and on several occasions received treatment with corticoids. The clinical picture basically consisted of an impairment of the general condition with respiratory symptomatology and fever of 38 to 39 degrees C. An opaque pleuropulmonary image was observed on the chest X-ray film, and the diagnosis of tuberculosis was initially established. The correct diagnosis was confirmed through the bacteriological examination of the transtracheal aspirate with the isolation of N. asteroides. Treatment with streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim achieved the clinical and roentgenologic cure of the patient. After 2 months of treatment the clinical manifestations had disappeared and after 5 months the chest X-ray was normal. Some epidemiologic data are reviewed.</dc:description>
