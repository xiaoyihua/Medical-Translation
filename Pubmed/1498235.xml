Gathering of data from the original articles (the number of authors, province of their place of work, titles, total number of references, references from Atención Primaria, the number of self-quotations, etc.) In the seven years studied, 295 original articles have been published by 1467 authors, 44% of whom are family doctors. The average number of authors per article was 5. There are twelve Spanish provinces from which no-one has published. Altogether 4,908 bibliographic references, an average of 16.6 per article, have been used. The number of references from the journal itself rose steadily from 1% in 1984 to 11.7% in 1988, but went down to 10.3% in 1990. 52% of the bibliographic references were in Castilian and 42.6% in English. CONCLUSION The journal Atención Primaria is often quoted in original articles published in the same journal. The number of authors and references per original article is high but stable.</dc:description>
