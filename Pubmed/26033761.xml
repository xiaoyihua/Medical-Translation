<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The aim is to assess our experience with new Coloplast Titan™ Inflatable Penile Prosthesis (IPP) with One-Touch Release (OTR) pump. Our 3 main focuses of attention will be prosthesis performance and patient and partner satisfaction in our first 100 cases in 3 specialised centres by 2 principal surgeons. METHODS Retrospective review was used to assess the Coloplast Titan™ OTR implant procedures/cases in our departments (from October 2009 to December 2012). The changes in Erection Function (EF), Intercourse Satisfaction (IS), overall satisfaction of the patient and partner were assessed by use of the following questionnaires: EF and IS domains of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and modified EDITS. RESULTS Mean patient age (N = 100) was 54.2 years old (range: 20-77) with a mean length of follow-up of 21 months (range: 6-44). Mean length of prosthesis implanted was 18.6 cm (14-23.5). Only 3% of patients showed complications requiring surgical exploration. Good prosthesis performance was assessed in 99 patients (99%). Differences in the IIEF-EF and IIEF-IS domain before and after surgery were +16.8 and +6.4 respectively. Patient and partner overall satisfaction were 90% and 84% respectively in modified EDITS. The average number of postoperative teaching sessions needed to teach the patient how to operate the device was 1.28 (1-4). CONCLUSIONS The Coloplast Titan™ OTR IPP was easy to implant, inflate, and deflate with high levels of EF improvement, patient and partner satisfaction. A small number of postoperative teaching sessions were required for the patient to properly operate the device.</dc:description>
