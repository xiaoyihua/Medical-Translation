<dc:description xml:lang="en">Brucellosis is a zoonosis that affect cows, goats and pigs, but in endemic zones human beings are frequently infected. Brucella infection in animals is associated with a high incidence of abortion, in humans a cause-effect relationship has not been proven. We present four cases of pregnant women with Brucella infection, all were treated only with rifampin, the patients had adequate obstetric evolution, the deliveries were at term and there were not birth defects or intrauterine growth retardation. One woman had a relapse during her puerperium. In the medical literature review there were not enough support to attribute to brucellosis as causal factor of abortion in humans. The treatment during pregnancy must include the combination of rifampin with another antibiotic with intracellular action.</dc:description>
