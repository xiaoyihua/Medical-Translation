<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The perceived capacity of health management teams to utilize research for decision making is assessed, as well as proposals for strengthening such capacity. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 103 management teams (84.4% response rate) from a wide range of institutions in six contrasting and representative states in Mexico were asked to assess their perceived capacity for utilizing research and to propose strategies to strengthen that capacity. Qualitative and statistical techniques were used from April to November 2007, after approval by the Mexico National Institute of Public Health (INSP) Ethics Commission. RESULTS Significant differences across states were found. Only the acquisition of knowledge is significantly correlated with the human development index. The acquisition of research is identified as the priority for strengthening capacity, through increasing the qualifications of personnel in public health research. States with a lower human development index have more immediate needs for strengthening capacity. Proposals for strengthening capacity also depend on whether decision makers are aware of the importance of research. CONCLUSIONS The use of self-assessment should be encouraged at the state and institutional levels. Different strategies should be used to address differences among states.</dc:description>
