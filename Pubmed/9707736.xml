<dc:description xml:lang="en">Of 117 cases of peripheral facial palsy seen in our emergency room in 1995, 10 (8.5%) were relapses. Seven were males and 3, females. Mean age at the first appearance was 23.6 years. The mean interval between the first facial palsy and the first recurrence was 10.1 years, and between the first and second recurrence, 4.6 years. Five of the 10 patients (50%) had a second recurrence. Two of the 10 patients (20%) had a family history of facial palsy. Only 1 (10%) was diabetic. Seven of 10 patients achieved a complete functional recovery and 3 had sequelae. Computed tomography was normal in every patient. In our series, a family history of facial palsy and low ENoG results were related with a poorer prognosis. ENoG scan was used as a prognostic and follow-up factor.</dc:description>
