<dc:description xml:lang="en">Many clinical entities show manifestations in the lips and sometimes such localization is eminent. In the photodermatosis there are different degrees of compromise of the lips. In the Polimorphus Light Eruption the cheilitis is a very common feature in the tropics and sometimes is the only manifestation of the disease for some time, or is accompanied by scant elements in the face and forearms. It is necessary to distinguish between chronic Antinic Cheilitis and the Eczematous cheilitis produced by the photosensitizing action of very well known substances contained in lip-sticks. The exfoliative cheilitis sometimes is found in atopic patients or patients with emotional disturbances. The Cheilitis present in patients with actinic chronic dermatitis are able to transform in Epithelioms.</dc:description>
