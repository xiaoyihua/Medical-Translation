<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify associations between high-stress and burnout syndrome in multidisciplinary residents from a federal university in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. METHOD This is an analytical, cross-sectional and quantitative study. A socio-demographic questionnaire, the Work Stress Scale and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Health Services Survey (MBI-HSS) were applied to 37 residents between April and June 2011. P-values&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS We verified that 48.65% of the residents experienced high-stress. When associating the MBI-HSS subscales, we verified that 27% of the residents showed some indication of burnout syndrome. There was a statistically significant correlation (p=0.00, r=0.68) between a high-stress and burnout. CONCLUSIONS High-stress was confirmed as being a predictor of burnout syndrome among multidisciplinary residents. Therefore, we propose that intervention studies be conducted in order to change such contexts.</dc:description>
