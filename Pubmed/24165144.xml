<dc:description xml:lang="en">Intestinal parasitic diseases are widely spread in the world, with the highest prevalence in developing countries. Children are mainly affected, showing a decrease in physical and mental development, as well as the expected manifestations of the disease. This situation can be greatly enhanced in children with poor nutritional status. The World Health Organization considers intestinal parasitic diseases a major cause of morbidity, closely linked to poverty and poor personal hygiene, inappropriate handling of raw food, lack of sanitation, lack of potable water supply, and environmental fecal contamination. Some parasitic diseases are cosmopolitan while others have variable geographic distribution, due to different factors such as the presence of exclusive intermediate hosts. In the past few years, globalization allowed the spread of certain parasites from endemic to non-endemic regions. Even though people's customs influence on the frequency of certain parasites, environmental conditions are a determinant factor for parasite survival. In our country, due to the variety of soils and climatic conditions, several causative agents of these parasitoses can be found. The aim of this work was to review the literature on the intestinal parasitic agents found in Argentina in human fecal samples and its environment, as parasitic contamination constitutes a direct indicator of the infection risk by intestinal parasites.</dc:description>
