<dc:description xml:lang="en">Between Oct. 1st 1971 and Sept. 30th 1976, 2,901 cases of seizures in children under 7 years of age have been treated in the Emergency Service of "La Fe" Children's Hospital of Valencia. On this basis, we have tried to demonstrate the presence of "runs" of such seizure cases, which were thought to exist. We have also studied the relationship between the seizure frequency and the atmospheric pressure. The yearly and monthly seizure distributions don't show statistically any significant difference. Neither do week-days or periods of the day. Mathematic study hasn't shown non-periodic "runs" either of the seizure cases within the total amount of emergency cases, or of the days with an admission rate of three or more seizure cases within all the days with the study period. Statistical studies comparing the seizure frequency with the mean atmospheric pressure in the daily intervals from 8.00 to 14.00, from 14.00 to 19.00 and from 19.00 to 8.00 of the following day, and with the respective barometric gradient, show that there aren't any correlations. Neither is there any correlation between seizure frequency and daily maximum barometric gradient. However it is demonstrated that in extremely low atmospheric pressures (under 1001.9 milibar) the seizure frequency is higher. A bibliographical review on meteorotropism of convulsions is made.</dc:description>
