<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To review the effectiveness and security of the TVT-Secur system in the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence(SUI). METHODS Prospective analysis of 110 patients undergoing SUI surgical treatment in the Urogynecology and Vaginal Surgery Unit of Clínica Las Condes, between January 2007 and May 2008. The patients must have stress urinary incontinence over one year or more. They must not have history of a previous surgery for urinary incontinence or prolapse. They must not have mixed monstrated by clinical symptoms and non-multichannel urodynamic study. RESULTS Mean surgical time was 8 minutes (6 to 16 minutes). The observational period was between 2 months (4 cases) and 19 months, mean 8 months. During the intraoperative time 2 cases of bladder perforation were registered. In the immediate postoperative time 2 cases of obstruction were observed. In 97 (88,2%) of the 110 patients some concomitant gynecological surgery was performed. In 105 (95,5%) of the 110 cases cure of the SUI was registered. In 4 (3,6%) cases improvement was observed and 1 (0,9%) case was a failure. In 2 (1,8%) patients de novo urge incontinence was registered. CONCLUSIONS The TVT-Secur system corresponds to a third generation tape effective and safe in the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence. This technique has potential advantages when compared with the preceding operations. Only the long time follow-up and incorporation of new patients will allow to determine the permanence of these good results in the time.</dc:description>
