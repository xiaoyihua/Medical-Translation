<dc:description xml:lang="en">Middle Magdalena region is an area with an industrial-mining with exploration and refining of oil. Therefore the animals that live in this geographical area are affected by the presence of pollutants, especially heavy metals. In this study 40 adult animals slaughtered  in  the  abattoir  in  Barrancabermeja,  from  bovine holdings nearby industries with petroleum extraction activities were studied. The presence of lead, cadmium, molybdenum and zinc in liver, kidney, muscle and skin was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and the results obtained with the limits set by the European Union and the Codex Alimentarius were compared [1,2]. Higher concentration of all metals was found in Barrancabermejaexcept Zn presented higher levels in Yondó. A significant number of liver samples (90 and 50%), kidney (75 and 15%) and muscle (85 and 90%) of both locations exceeded the permissible values of Pb both the Codex Alimentarius and the European Union. A similar situation occurs with cd in Barrancabermeja, exceeding 85%, 10%and all (100%) values allowed by the European Union in liver, kidney and muscle respectively, while in Yondó, 65% of samples liver and muscle samples exceed all those same limits. Therefore we can conclude that the consumption of meat and offal from cattlegrazing in the Middle Magdalena Colombian, represents a seriousrisk to human health as a result of its high degree of contamination with heavy metals (AU)</dc:description>
