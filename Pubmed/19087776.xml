<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has a high prevalence among obese patients. It has been difficult to identify clear predictors of chronic liver damage, which could help in selecting patients for liver biopsy and therapeutic options. The aim of the study is to describe the liver damage in these obese patients and identify predictors of liver damage progression. PATIENTS AND METHOD 76 obese patients submitted to bariatric surgery were included. Liver biopsies were taken at the time at the time of the surgery. Clinical and biochemical variables were analyzed. RESULTS 67 patients (88.1%) were found to have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; 41 (61.2%) had simple steatosis, and 26 (38.8%) had non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis had significantly higher values of GGT. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis was associated with diabetes (p &lt; 0.01) in these patients. CONCLUSIONS Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is highly prevalent in morbidly obese patients. Non- alcoholic steatohepatitis seems to be associated with diabetes and high values of GGT in obese patients.</dc:description>
