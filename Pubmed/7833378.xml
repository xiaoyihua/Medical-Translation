<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the degree of compliance with standards defined for Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) quality control in our hospital in the two-year period 1991-1992. MATERIAL AND METHODS All available information was assessed concerning 52 patients (32 men and 17 women) for whom a TPN course was prescribed in relation with certain pre-set indications. These patients received a total of 1140 TPN units with the TPN lasting an average of 21.9 days (range, 1-73 days). Monitoring was done by the Nutrition and Diet Section. The degree of compliance was assessed with the standards model proposed by the Providence Medical Center, Portland (USA) (PMCP) with 24 parameters (PM): indications, initiation in the first 24 hours, nutritional assessment in the first 24 hours, period of the TPN, metabolic complications (14 PM), septic complications (3 PM), nutritional consequences (2 PM) and TPN losses. All parameters were appraised and admitted, except for urea, which was corrected to standard values of our Laboratory (&lt; 44 mg/dl), with Transferrin evaluation instead of iron binding capacity (TIBC), taking as compliance standard a figure of &gt; 190 mg/dl. All analytical calculations were carried out in our Central Laboratory Service. RESULTS Of all the parameters, the following were discarded, not being calculated on a routine basis: total CO2, serous magnesium, urinary uric nitrogen, nitrogen balance, positive hemocultures, catheters and TPN losses. Levels of compliance varied between 31.9% and 100%, with 8 parameters within the standards (Initiation, 100%; evaluation in first 24 hours, 100%; extent, 100%; creatinine, 100%; total bilirubin, 92.2%; cholesterol, 99.5%; transferrin, 35.9%). Seven parameters fell short (Na, 88.1%; K, 92.9%; Cl, 89.3%; Urea, 54.4%; Glucose, 96.4%; P, 94.1%; Triglycerides, 71.9%). CONCLUSIONS We infer from our study that there is a need to make use of a large part of the indicators described in the literature as indicators for quality guarantee of a TPN program, and the use of new parameters must be assessed in normal monitoring.</dc:description>
