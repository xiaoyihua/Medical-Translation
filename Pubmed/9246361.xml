<dc:description xml:lang="en">In Costa Rica, a total of 640 samples from eight different vegetables used for raw consumption, were analyzed for the presence of intestinal parasites and fecal coliforms. Eighty samples of each vegetable were analyzed, forty during the dry season and forty in the rainy. A greater, but unsignificant (p &gt; 0.05) level of fecal coliforms was found during the dry season. Levels of Escherichia coli, were higher (p &lt; 0.05) during the dry season in lettuce (Latuca sativa) and cilantro (Coleandrum sativum) leaves. Cysts of Endolimax nana, Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis and Cryptosporidium sp. were found in all vegetables. The greater percentage of positive samples was found during the dry season, although these relation was only corroborated (p &lt; 0.05) in radish (Raphanus sativus) and cilantro leaves. Only lettuce and cilantro levels showed a positive linear correlation (p &lt; 0.05) between occurrences of intestinal parasites and fecal coliforms.</dc:description>
