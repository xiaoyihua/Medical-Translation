<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the sensorial status in patients with pure accommodative esotropia. MATERIAL AND METHODS Ambispective study, patients with pure accommodative esotropia that were found in orthotropy when using its correction glasses were included. RESULTS 67 patients were included, mean age was 3.68±1.28 years, the near and far ocular deviation was 19±8.8 PD and 18.71±10.61 PD respectively. The visual acuity in the right eye was 0.183 ±0.11 logMAR, in the left eye was 0.188±0.12 logMAR. The average spherical equivalent was +5.50 diopters, for the right eye was +5.46 ±1.61 diopters and for the left eye +5.71 v±1.6 diopters. The average AC/A ratio was 5.19±0.92 Δ/1. 90% of the patients had a grade of near stereopsis: 42% had stereopsis equal or better to 70 arc seconds and 81% had stereopsis equal or better to 400 arc seconds, having an average of 205 arc seconds. 85% of the patients had some grade of far stereopsis: 16% had stereopsis equal or better to 70 arc seconds and 66% had a stereopsis equal or better to 400 arc seconds, having an average of 334.9 arc seconds. There was not statistically significant correlation between the grade of deviation and the stereopsis when using its correction. CONCLUSIONS This study has detected that the sensorial status is compromised even with adequate and appropriate treatment, nevertheless, there is a low frequency of amblyopia.</dc:description>
