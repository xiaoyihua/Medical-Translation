<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To find the prevalence of vaginal candidiasis in pregnant women monitored through primary care and to see whether it is on the increase. DESIGN Descriptive and retrospective study of pregnant women. SETTING Cazoña Health District (34,783 inhabitants). SUBJECTS The entire obstetric population monitored by our health centre between 1992 and 1997 inclusive. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Retrospective study of clinical histories of all the pregnant women seen at our health centre (878 pregnancies). After discounting those referred to obstetricians, abortions/miscarriages and premature births, 549 normal low-risk pregnancies (62.30% of the total) were monitored to completion in primary care. The women's age range was 16 to 40. The mean prevalence of candidiasis was 18% (CI, 15.0-21.6). Its frequency increased as the number of pregnancies increased and dropped as the age of the pregnant women increased. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence found in our study was 18% and did not increase as the years passed.</dc:description>
