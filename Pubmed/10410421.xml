<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to analyze the postoperative progress and medical management in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of patients that underwent bilateral lung transplant. PATIENTS AND METHODS From April 1997 to June 1998, 10 pediatric lung transplants were performed at the Hospital Reina Sofía (Córdoba, Spain). There were 4 males and 6 females (mean age 11.5 years, range 5 to 15 years). Indications for transplantation were cystic fibrosis (n = 9) and one pulmonary fibrosis secondary to viral infection. Before the transplant, two patients required mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory decompensation and one patient was ventilator-dependent. Immunosuppression consisted of corticosteroids, azathioprine and cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Post-transplantation management included early extubation, when possible, optimal fluid balance to prevent lung edema, low aggressive mechanical ventilation and adequate treatment of complications, such as rejection and infection. RESULTS There were no peri-operative mortalities. The mean stay in the PICU was 28 days (median: 17 days) and the mean time on mechanical ventilation was 19 days (median: 5.5 days). The most frequent complications were rejection (n = 8), hyperglycemia (n = 6), renal failure (n = 4), arterial hypertension (n = 4) and respiratory infections (n = 3). There were no airway complications. CONCLUSIONS Even if the post-operative period in pediatric lung transplant patients is difficult, the results have been good with an important improvement in the quality of life of these patients has been achieved.</dc:description>
