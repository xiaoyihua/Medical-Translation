<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Medical School of the Pontifical Catholic University is devoted to a reform process aiming to adequate undergraduate training to scientific, technological, cultural and social changes in medical practice in Chile and to incorporate novel teaching methodology. One of the main modifications is the change of the resulting professional from "a general physician capable of resolving most medical problems of rural or urban populations" to "a physician with a solid general training but qualified for a subsequent specialization". This requires curricular flexibility to obtain different professional profiles. Other important changes are a reduction in curricular contents and their vertical and horizontal integration, modernization of teaching methodologies with the incorporation of computing techniques and problem oriented teaching and the incorporation of new subjects such as molecular biology, clinical genetics, health economics. To achieve these objectives, a semi-flexible curriculum was devised, the curricular mesh has been modified extensively, an outpatient and a nine months elective internship were added. Most modifications have been implemented, remaining changes in 4th and 5th years. These changes required a reorganisation of academic structure, the use of new selection, training and perfecting criteria for teachers, better salaries for outstanding professors and improvement of teaching infrastructure. This reform must be seen as a medium term integral change in the context of an integral academic development plan.</dc:description>
