<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this study the relative frequency of oral lesions was evaluated in a group of 526 patients, 55 years old or elder. Clinical and pathological data were obtained from 244 patients who attended to a clinic of Medical and Social Assistance Program (PAMI) ad from 282 cases registered in the files of the Surgical Pathology Laboratory F.O.U.B.A. (LAP) since 1984 to 1986. The mean age of the groups was 63 years old. The most frequency lesions were the pseudotumors (44.6%) in LAP and (17.2%) in PAMI; premalignant lesions were (20.5%) in LAP, while in PAMI (2.4%). The cysts in LAP found (15.6%) in PAMI were (2.4%). The groups of PAMI showed (90%) of Candidiasis. Traumatic ulcer (30.7%) and afthae (28.8%). In LAP were (4.6%) the traumatic ulcer. The malignant tumors the most frequency was carcinoma espinocelular (8.16%) LAP and (6.56%) PAMI. It was remarkable that stomatodine as represented in PAMI (72.2%) and Candidiasis were (90%). Candidiasis were 90% of the specific inflammations. Results suggest that oral mobility in elderly patients correlates with the findings in this type of social assisted groups. The figures of the importance of methodical collaboration of Stomatologists and Oral Pathologists for differential diagnosis.</dc:description>
