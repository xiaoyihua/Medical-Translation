<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To evaluate the urodynamic characteristics of a series of women with stress urinary incontinence presenting various rates of vaginal prolapse. METHODS 92 female patients were included in this study, mean age was 48 years (range 29-75). All patients underwent urogynecologic physical examination (vaginal prolapse was graded) and complete urodynamic study in order to detect the presence of detrusor overactivity. Urodynamic terminology and measurements comply with the ICS (International Continence Society) standards. Statistical significance was established below 0.05. RESULTS 65 women (70.6%) presented anterior vaginal prolapse and 31 (33.6%) posterior vaginal prolapse. Involuntary contractions of the detrusor muscle appeared in 13 patients (20%) who had an anterior vaginal prolapse and 6 women (19.3%) who had a posterior vaginal prolapse. The existence of involuntary contractions was not associated with the diagnosis of vaginal prolapse. CONCLUSION Our study did not show any correlation between existence of vaginal prolapse and detrusor overactivity.</dc:description>
