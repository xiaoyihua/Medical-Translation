<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The objective of this paper is to evaluate body composition and energy expenditure in women with excess body weight. METHODS There was a non-randomized, cross-sectional study with 40 women, [26 with excess weight (G1) and 14 eutrophic (G2)]. The following evaluations were made: dietetic, anthropometric and body composition (electrical bioimpedance), physical activity (three-dimensional accelerometer) and energy expenditure, basal and resting (indirect calorimetry). RESULTS The energy intake and physical activity did not differ between groups. The parameters of body composition were higher in G1, except total body water. There was a relationship between energy expenditure and body composition. The lean mass was the biggest determinant of energy expenditure. There was no difference in metabolic parameters between groups, but lower nutrient oxidation and increased metabolic efficiency in G1 was suggested. CONCLUSION Excess weight was associated with body composition and energy expenditure changes that justify the accumulation of body fat.</dc:description>
