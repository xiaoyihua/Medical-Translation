<dc:description xml:lang="en">A new diploid cell line of human embrionary kidney was obtained by serial subcultures (Mag) starting from a primary culture. It was prepared by applying the explant technique instead of the classical enzymatic digestion with trypsin. The stabilization process of the diploid line after the "secondary culture" was attained between the passes 6 and 7. 3 culture media were tested during the process. Only the MEM was completely satisfactory. The biological characteristics of the new line were as follows: fibroblastic morphology, Eagle MEM culture mean with 10% of SBF, split from 1:2 to 1:3, normal human carotype, postfreezing viability of 60%, pollutant-free and non-tumorigenic. The cryopreserved Mag subcultures 11-13 were studied from the point of view of their usefulness for the diagnosis of different viral groups.</dc:description>
