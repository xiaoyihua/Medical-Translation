<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To describe epidemiological characteristics, types of injury, prognosis and medical management of bicycle-related Paediatric Emergency Department (ED) visits and to identify potential preventive measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS This multicentred, observational prospective study included all children between 3 and 16 years of age treated for bicycle-related injuries in the Emergency Departments of 15 Spanish Hospitals belonging to the «Unintentional Paediatric Injury Workshop» of the Spanish Paediatric Emergency Society between the 1(st) of June 2011 and the 31(st) of May 2012. Characteristics of all ED visits, as well as epidemiological data and accident-related information, were collected. RESULTS A total of 846 patients were included in the study, with a male predominance (72.9%) and a median age of 9.6 ± 3.6 years. Head injury was the third most common injury (22.3%) and the main cause of admission to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) (68.4%). More than three-quarters (77.9%) of the patients did not wear a helmet, which was significantly associated to a higher incidence of head injury and admission to PICU. Older children (OR 1.063) and bicycle injuries involving motor vehicles (OR 2.431) were identified as independent risk factors for worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Since helmet use reduces up to 88% of central nervous system lesions secondary to head injury, promotion of its use should be the main preventive measure, followed by restriction of bike-riding to cycling areas.</dc:description>
