<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To provide an update on breast cancer mortality and hospital utilization in the autonomous region of Extremadura (Spain). METHOD We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study of breast cancer in Extremadura, using the minimum data set and the death register as data sources. The means and standard deviation (SD) are presented. Crude, age-specific, and standardized mortality rates were calculated and expressed as rates per 100,000 women. The potential years of life lost were also calculated. RESULTS In the period studied, there were 413 deaths, 1,233 hospital admissions, and 1,809 discharges due to malignant breast disease. The mean age at the time of death and hospital discharge was 70.0 years (SD 14.9) and 59.9 years (SD 14.3), respectively. The mean length of hospital stay was 8.9 days (SD 6.3). A total of 3,423 potential years of life were lost. The highest mortality rates of breast cancer were observed in the health area of Llerena and the lowest in the health area of Coria. CONCLUSIONS The pattern of breast cancer mortality in Extremadura is typical of developed countries with higher mortality among older age groups. The aged-adjusted rate in Extremadura is lower than that in Spain for the period 1996-2000.</dc:description>
