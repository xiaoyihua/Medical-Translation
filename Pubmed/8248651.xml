<dc:description xml:lang="en">The first medical strife in Chile occurred in the city of Valparaiso. The intendant protested to the examining board of physicians because 5 doctors refused to give emergency medical care to a patient late at night. "Is fair that both the authority and the public have the right to demand those services and it is not natural that their fulfillment depend on the good or bad will of the physicians". The intendant proclaimed a decree establishing a weekly obligatory nocturnal medical services of two physicians under police control and fine threaten. The 14 doctors of the city menaced to resing to their profession considering that the decree "violates constitution and laws." The medical corps of Santiago made common cause with their colleagues "profoundly irritated". The conflict was finally resolved.</dc:description>
