<dc:description xml:lang="en">The knowledge about population structure and dynamics of some neotropical species, especially those living in lotic systems is still barely studied. This study had the aim to assess if the conservation status of some lotic systems, is related to some demographic variables of P. gigantea, so this may be used as a model for ecological monitoring. For this, we evaluated the population structure of P. gigantea three times per month (almost one sampling event every eight days) in four streams of the state of Antioquia, Colombia, from March-June 2009. The specimens were collected using entomological nets along a transect of 200m in the littoral zone of each stream. The insects were marked on the wings and the population size was estimated with the mark-recapture method. Our results showed that the largest population size was recorded for the stream "La Catedral" with aprox 299 individuals, followed by the stream "La Doctora" with 218 individuals. Nevertheless, no significant differences in population size among the evaluated streams were found; and no statistical relationships were found between vegetation variables and the population size of P. gigantea. However, taking into account the limited dispersal capacity of P. gigantea, its survival in the studied streams was considered to be at risk, due to the continuous modification of large riparian forest areas, which cause the increase of forest patches, with different levels of interconnection, and hinder long-term permanence of populations.</dc:description>
