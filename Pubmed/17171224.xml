<dc:description xml:lang="en">Evidence based medicine is strongly positioned in medical practice. However we must remember that it should be just a part of our knowledge and skills and that a close relationship with our patients is essential. I report a 52 years old male that presented with abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant lasting seven days, that started after participating in a celebration dinner. Abdominal ultrasound was normal and biochemical tests were within normal limits. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a toothpick that was perforating the gastric wall. The toothpick was withdrawn and the pain subsided. The patient was discharged asymptomatic three days later.</dc:description>
