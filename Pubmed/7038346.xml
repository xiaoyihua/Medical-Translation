<dc:description xml:lang="en">We have studied five cases of "Tinea capitis" in adults and two in young people (13 years old). All the adults cases and one of the young people were female. The causative fungi have been: "T. violaceum" in four patients; "T. mentagrophytes", var. granulosum, "T. mentagrophytes", var. vellosa and "T. tonsurans", in each of the others three, respectively. The clinical features in one case was similar to a seborrheic dermatites with a resaciform "Tinea faciei"; three other cases were suggestive of cronic imptigo contagiosa and even of favus impetigoid; still other one was mimicking a pseudopelada; other one started as a alopecia areata. developing later on, deep abscesiform lesions of torpid evolution; the last one had a typical kerion Celsii. All the patients have showed a good response to specific treatment, with satisfactory regrowing of hair. There are comments on the casuistic and comparation with the reviewed cases in the medical literature.</dc:description>
