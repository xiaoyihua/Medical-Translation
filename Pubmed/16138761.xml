<dc:description xml:lang="en">Living donor kidney transplantation has become the option of preference for the treatment of endstage renal disease, whenever its performance is possible. The advantages of patient and graft survival should be balanced with risks associated with donation. Therefore, the evaluation of candidates for living donor kidney transplantation is mainly the comprehensive evaluation of these risks: medical, psychological, social and economic. Evaluating risks implies we are treating a controversial process, the medical progress, which is modifiable with time, even in the family and/or social environment of the donor-receptor couple. Short and long-term safety of living donor nephrectomy is directly engaged to the existence of a healthy donor. This he is the main objective of standard evaluation of candidates. Currently, with a growing demand of this option, minor abnormalities or risk factors detected during evaluation do not always become a formal contraindication, but we should try to establish a most objective threshold for the acceptance of donors in all evaluated spheres, for surgical risks and others directly related or not with renal mass reduction, and even for those engaged to the existence of a genetic link between donor and receptor, which might determine the presence of any future primary renal disease. As for other donation types, the process of evaluation should also ensure minimal risks for the receptor, with the same safety criteria applied to cadaver donors. We can conclude that careful evaluation of candidates for living kidney donation is the best guarantee for their safety and transplant success, and, in our opinion, it is the best instrument to offer an adequate informed consent.</dc:description>
