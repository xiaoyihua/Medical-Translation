<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the last year, several scientific societies have published guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension. In Spain, two clinical practice guidelines have had a strong impact and have been closely followed in the last few years: the first is the Guideline of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, although their last report (JNC 7) was published in 2003; the second is the clinical practice guideline for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH), whose latest version was published in 2007, although an update was published in 2009. A new ESC/ESH document, published in 2013, adopts a mainly educational stance, closely rooted in clinical practice. Many of the recommendations maintain the same criteria as previous guidelines. However, the new publication shows greater rigor and contains major contributions such as specification of the level of evidence and grade of recommendation for each recommendation, which was lacking in the previous guidelines of these societies. The document is both practical and easy to consult, consisting of 17 tables, 5 figures and 18 blocks of recommendations. The JNC 8 report, however, has a single objective: to respond to three questions that are considered a priority and which refer exclusively to drug therapy. Nine recommendations are made relating to these three questions.</dc:description>
