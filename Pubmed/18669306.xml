<dc:description xml:lang="en">The need in resolving massive bone losses in hip region caused by tumors, infections, trauma or failed arthroplasties in 17 years of the Bone Tumors Department of the National Rehabilitation Institute, Mexico City, and data obtained from different studies: 1) Biomechanic study of an unconventional hip arthroplasty system, 2) Tridimensional model of a human femur by the finite element method, 3) Biomechanical analysis of a system bone-implant for reconstruction of the proximal third of the femur by the finite element method, 4) Incidence of tumor and pseudotumor bone and soft tissue lesions of the hip, generated the project of designing an unconventional interlocked hip arthroplasty system for femur reconstruction. Two processes were done for adequate manufacturing and dimensioning: Anthropomorphometric study of Mexican femora; 2) Design of an unconventional hip arthroplasty system with the following characteristics: first, the arthroplasty system is constituted by an intramedullar stem, is fixated to femur with interlocking screws, this fixation method was inspired from the design of intramedullar nails of Dr. Fernando Colchero Rosas. The system has a second fixation system in the femur cut region, resolved by a fenestrated support introduced in the cortical wall. Once data was processed, the need for manufacturing 2 models was determined: 1) One for the proximal 11 cm of the femur and 2) other for the 12 distal cm. The height of interlocking screws, 2 models of intracortical proximal support (one fixated and one fixable with an expansible screw), were designed. Diameter, length of the stems, size of spacers and supports were determined for adequate interlocking fixation. We designed the instruments for assembling, impaction and orientation of the arthroplasty system. The system was presented to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, at March 15, 1996 and the patent was conceded April 19, 2007 (#245717).</dc:description>
