<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To know the frequency, trends and associated factors of peptic ulcer disease in our Institute. BACKGROUND Peptic ulcer is an important disease; about 5-10% of the population can expect to develop this disease during lifetime. MATERIAL AND METHODS We reviewed 1,123 patients with peptic ulcer in five years. Sex, age, habits (tobacco and alcohol consumption), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use, ulcer location and complications were analyzed. To evaluate temporal trends, our results were compared with previous studies made in our Institute. RESULTS The male-female ratio was 1:1, with a mean age of 52.2 years. Forty percent of the patients had duodenal ulcer, 42% had gastric ulcer, and 19% had esophageal, anastomotic or multiple ulcers. The most common complication was bleeding, which occurred more frequently in gastric (37%) than duodenal ulcer (24%) (P &lt; 0.005). Gastric ulcer occurred in older patients when compared to duodenal ulcer (P &lt; 0.02). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs consumption was more frequent in patients with gastric (14%) than duodenal ulcer (10%) (P &lt; 0.04). The frequency of tobacco and alcohol consumption was higher in multiple ulcers. CONCLUSIONS A tendency toward a decreased frequency of duodenal ulcer and increased frequency of gastric ulcer was observed in our Institute during the last 30 years. In the same period, bleeding has been the leading complication, suggesting a higher referral of complicated peptic ulcer.</dc:description>
