<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Due to recent medical advances, patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) can expect longer survival rates and, as a result, face previously unreported complications such as osteoporosis. Our goal was to determine the mineral bone density in young adult patients with CF attended in the adult CF Unit, and correlate these findings with other clinical variables of interest in this patient population. PATIENTS AND METHOD We carried out a transversal study from 1999 to 2002 of 34 patients with CF (19 males and 15 females. Mean age 23 years). Upon enrollment in the study, patient gender and age were recorded along with Schwachman and Brasfield scores, pulmonary function test results (spirometry) and sputum analysis, phosphorus and calcium balance, vitamin D intake, and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) findings of the spinal column (L2-L4) and femur. RESULTS 54.5% of all study patients were found to have an abnormal mineral bone density. Fifteen patients met criteria for osteopenia and 3 for osteoporosis. Age, treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, and pulmonary function test results correlated with bone density. CONCLUSIONS DEXA scans should be performed in young adults with CF at least once during the course of their illness on the basis of the high prevalence of mineral bone density abnormalities in this population.</dc:description>
