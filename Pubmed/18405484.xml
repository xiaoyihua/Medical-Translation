<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of endoscopic ultrasonography in the etiological diagnosis of patients initially diagnosed with acute idiopathic pancreatitis and to determine the clinical and laboratory factors related to the results of this technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied 73 patients initially diagnosed with acute idiopathic pancreatitis and referred to our service for biliopancreatic endoscopic ultrasonography. A positive result was considered to be identification of at least one possible cause of pancreatitis, excluding patients in whom the only echoendoscopic finding was chronic pancreatitis. The clinical characteristics and clinical course of these patients were compared with the results of the technique. RESULTS Endoscopic ultrasonography diagnosed at least one possible cause of acute pancreatitis in 32 patients (44%). The most frequent diagnoses were cholelithiasis (16%) and biliary sludge (20%). The diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasonography was lower in patients with prior cholecystectomy (16% vs. 49%; p=0.037) while a positive result was more likely in patients with elevated glutamyl oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) or glutamyl pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels at diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (GOT: 68 vs. 31%; p=0.002; GPT: 63 vs. 26%; p=0.001). No differences were found in diagnostic yield according to whether endoscopic ultrasonography was performed during the first episode of pancreatitis (48%) or in recurrent episodes (37%) (p=0.40). Over a mean follow-up period of 28 months, recurrence of new episodes of pancreatitis was significantly lower in patients with an etiological diagnosis (3 vs. 22%; p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic ultrasonography is a useful technique in the etiological diagnosis of acute pancreatitis of unknown origin, especially in patients with elevated transaminase levels and/or without cholecystectomy. This technique should be used in the first episode of acute idiopathic pancreatitis.</dc:description>
