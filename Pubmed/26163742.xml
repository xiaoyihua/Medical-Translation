<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients present chronic cough as one of the main symptoms, which has an important effect on quality of life and social relations. Our goal was to validate the Spanish version of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) in a group of children and teenagers with CF. METHODS After adapting to Spanish by standardized translation and retro-translation methodology, a sample of 58 stable CF patients from 7 to 18 years were recruited from three CF specialized centers in Spain. The questionnaire was administered twice; the second administration (LCQ2) was performed between 2-4 weeks later than the first one (LCQ1), in order to analyse the reliability and validity of the Spanish version. To correlate results with health related quality of life (HRQoL) we used the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R). RESULTS Population was composed by 62% male, age 11.7 ± 3.1 years and body mass index (BMI) 19 ± 3 kg/m(2). Total scores from LCQ were: LCQ1 19 (17.75-21) vs LCQ2 19 (16-21) (P=.199). Cronbach's Alpha coefficient was 0.83 for the LCQtotal and for each specific domain was: 0.82 LCQphysical; 0.74 LCQpsychological and 0.62 LCQsocial. Intraclass correlation coefficient was: 0.69 LCQphysical; 0.59 LCQpsychological; 0.45 LCQsocial and 0.71 LCQtotal (good reliability). Relations with CFQ-R showed moderated and significant results: for the LCQtotal: respiratory symptom domain r = 0,51 (P&lt;.001) and physical capacity domain r = 0,62 (P&lt;.05). CONCLUSION The Spanish version of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire is reliable and valid for children and adolescents with CF and it has good relations with health related quality of life in this population.</dc:description>
