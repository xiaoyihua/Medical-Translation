<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To perform a literature review on the use of buccal mucosa graft (BMG) in the treatment of extensive ureteral stenosis, according to the criteria of Evidence Based Medicine. METHODS Pubmed search of published studies with the following keywords: "ureteral stricture treatment", "buccal mucosa graft ureteral treatment" and "buccal mucosa graft ureteroplasty", without time limits, in English and Spanish; 12 articles were identified with a total of 48 cases (46 patients) of BMG use in ureteral repair. RESULTS The main etiologies of ureteral stenosis, where BMG has been applied, have been iatrogenic and inflammatory strictures. This graft has been used complicamainly in proximal or middle ureter stenosis, as a patch according to onlay technique or as a tubularized graft. Early and late complications of the procedure have been reported in 16.7% and 10.4%, respectively, with a restenosis rate of 6.25%. A 91.6% success rate was observed with this technique, with an average follow-up time of 22 (3-85) months. CONCLUSIONS The findings of the present review do not justify the universal use of BMG in all ureteral strictures, particularly in the absence of long-term followup, but still provide evidence that BMG can be effectively used in extensive ureteral strictures.</dc:description>
