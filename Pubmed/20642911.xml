<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Colonic stenosis is rarely seen in pediatric practice. Its incidence has been reported as 1/40,000 births. Ascending and transverse colon are the most common sites affected. Symptoms may be present at birth. CLINICAL CASE We present the case of a 2 year, 11 month old male. Since birth, the patient had symptoms of constipation, abdominal pain and abdominal distension. X-ray of the abdomen showed a dilated colon and foreign bodies on the right side. Barium enema was normal. The stenotic segment was resected. Foreign bodies were removed and alimentary continuity was restored by end-to-end anastomosis. The pathologist found a 5-cm lumen at the stenosis. Histological ganglion cells were present throughout the specimen. The patient evolved favorably postoperatively and was discharged 1 week after surgery. The patient has been in good health for 2 years. CONCLUSIONS Colonic stenosis is uncommon. Abu-Judeh reported on one case and a review of the literature revealed eight cases of congenital colonic stenosis since 1941. Symptoms are abdominal distension, vomiting and constipation with symptom remission, making diagnosis difficult. This is the first report involving foreign bodies. Barium enema and colonoscopy are necessary for diagnosis. Resection of the stenotic segment with end-to-end anastomosis or colostomy is the treatment of choice. Laparoscopy is an alternative procedure.</dc:description>
