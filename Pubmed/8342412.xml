<dc:description xml:lang="en">During the second half of the 15th century and beginning of the 16th century, the problem of "carnosities" and "urine passion" aroused an enormous concern within the social and courtesan environments. The Monarchy, participating in this concern and confronted with a lack of specialized surgeons, fostered the massive hiring of non-college professionals who demonstrated to be knowledgeable in the treatment and cure of this conditions, granting them degrees and nominations so that they could teach and spread their techniques. One of this practical men was the graduate Andrés de Tamayo, famous surgeon who worked for Philip II and Philip III, acclaimed writer and poet who in 1617 obtained the degree of surgeon and "urologist" of the Royal Family for his dedication and specialization in "urine passions and carnosities".</dc:description>
