<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper is focused in the study of singing voices of both women and children, with the purpose of displaying and verify the existing differences of the two. In this article will be made clear than the affirmation made by Husson, Garde and Arribas (1962, 1973 and 1975, respectively) is not a dogmatic statement. The method used by us in order to drawn out the conclusions are the following: 1. A discriminative audio-perceptive technique requiring skilled experts in order to settle if the recorded voices belong to women, boys or girls. 2. Other technique adopted is founded in the spectral analysis of fragments recorded with the integrator of spectral density. The obtained results are as follows: The analysis audio-acoustic disclose differences between feminine voices and children voices. The experts could, with certainty, differentiate between each one of them (women 74%; children 79%). By means of the spectrum analysis was possible to verify that the prime objective of the spectral analysis employed is able to mimicking the global subjective impression received through the human auditory system.</dc:description>
