<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Migraine is a common complaint in childhood. Atopy is the predisposition to the complaint of one or more of the following conditions: atopic dermatitis, rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. AIM To examine whether there is a relationship between atopy, taking into account each of its different variants, and migraine with or without aura. The practical application of knowing about this association includes improvement in the diagnosis of migraine, which is often difficult in children. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective case-control study of children (5-15 years old) with and without migraine; recruitment time: six months. Data evaluated included age, sex, questions from a questionnaire about atopy to measure prevalence, and medical diagnosis that appears in the patient's medical record and overall (intersection of the previous ones), among other things. A statistical analysis was performed. The odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval were both estimated. Confusion factors were studied. RESULTS Altogether 216 children were analysed. The prevalence of atopic dermatitis (OR = 7.1; p &lt; 0.01), rhinoconjunctivitis (OR = 7.3; p &lt; 0.01) and allergic asthma (OR = 4.69; p &lt; 0.01), as well as their previous and overall medical diagnoses, is significantly higher and more severe in children with migraine. Dermatitis and rhinitis are more commonly diagnosed in the cases with aura. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence and the percentage of prior and overall diagnoses of the three atopic diseases are significantly higher in children with migraine.</dc:description>
