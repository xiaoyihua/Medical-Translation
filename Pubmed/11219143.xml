<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To compare colon cleansing and tolerance with two preparations: polyethylene glycol 4-liters (PEG) and sodium phosphate (FS). MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective randomized study of 100 consecutive patients who underwent endoscopy after taking PEG (Bohm lavage solution) or FS (Fosfosoda). All patients were evaluated for the presence of adverse effects, degree of discomfort of the preparations (1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe) and the degree of cleansing with the products (1: poor, 2: fair, 3: good, 4: excellent). RESULTS Age, sex, depth of insertion and surgical history were similar for both groups. Discomfort in the FS group was mild in 37, moderate in 11 and severe in 2 (mean score 1.30 +/- 0.54); in the PEG group it was mild in 28, moderate in 15 and severe in 7 (mean score 1.58 +/- 0.73). Colon cleansing was poor or fair in 11 (22%) patients in the PEG group and in 8 (16%) patients in the FS group and was good or excellent in 39 (78%) in the PEG group in comparison with 42 (84%) in the FS group. Among the 50 patients who took the FS preparation, 12 had previously taken the PEG preparation and 11 of these preferred the FS preparation. Among the 50 patients who took the PEG preparation, 10 had previously taken preparations: 4 had used enemas (considering the present PEG to be worse) and 6 had taken the same PEG as that used in the present study (p &lt; 0.005). One patient in the FS group and four in the PEG group did not complete the preparation because of vomiting. The adverse effects of both preparations were similar. CONCLUSIONS The adverse effects and degree of colon cleansing were similar for FS and PEG. Tolerance and patient comfort were greater with FS than with PEG.</dc:description>
