<dc:description xml:lang="en">Testicular and paratesticular tumors are rare in childhood, representing 1-2 percent of the solid tumors in the pediatric age. In patients under 14 years, the incidence is 0.5-2/100,000. The evolution differs from that of the adult. Since 1981 to 1994 we have treated 14 cases of testicular and paratesticular tumors. Mean age was 2.54 years, the younger patients presenting germinal tumors. The most frequent tumor was the yolk sac tumor (36%), followed by teratoma mature (29%), and Leydig cell tumor, epidermoid cyst, paratesticular fibrous hamartoma, paratesticular neuroblastoma and paratesticular rabdomyosarcoma (7% each). A testicular mass was present in all cases (100%). Testicular ultrasound was used in 100%. In all the patients with malignant tumors a thoraco-abdominal CT scans was done to rule out extension or the tumor, being negative in all cases. Alphafetoprotein were high in all the cases of yolk sac tumor, being within normal range one month after surgery except in one case. In 11 patients an orquiectomy was done through an inguinal approach, and in three cases a simple tumorectomy without orquiectomy. No lymphadenectomy was done. All the malignants neoplasms were stage I tumors, except one yolk sac tumor stage III. Postop chemotherapy was applied in this one and in the embrionary rabdomyosarcoma. There were no recurrences after a follow-up mean time of 3.98.</dc:description>
