<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Cystic tumors of the pancreas comprise 1% of all neoplasms of the pancreas and 10 to 15% of pancreatic cysts. There are a variety of cystic lesions, of which 90% is made up of serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystic neoplasms, intraductal mucinous neoplasms and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study describes and analyzes retrospectively the clinical, radiological, surgical, pathological and follow up of 12 patients operated on for cystic tumors of the pancreas in the hospital IV Alberto Sabogal Sologuren, in the period 2005 to 2010. RESULTS we found 5 (41%) serous cystadenomas with a mean age of 66 years, localized 80% in the head and 20% body; 2 (17%) mucinous cystic neoplasms with a mean age of 54, all located in body, 2 (17%) intraductal mucinous neoplasms with a mean age of 63, all located in the head, and 3 (25%) solid pseudopapillary neoplasms with a mean age of 33 years, located in body 33% and 66% in tail with a predominance of females in a ratio of 3:1. Had abdominal pain (75%), weight loss (17%) and palpable mass (17%). Of the 2 cystic mucinous neoplasms, only one have a low-grade dysplasia, of the two mucinous intraductal neoplasms, one have grade moderate dysplasia and the other with a high degree, the rest of cystic neoplasms were benign. We realize 6 Pancreaticoduodenectomy, 4 corporocaudales pancreatectomies, 2 distal pancreatectomies; of them splenectomy realize in 4 patients (2 in corporocaudal pancreatectomies and 2 distal pancreatectomies). In all cases the preoperative diagnosis was based on abdominal TEM. in 4 patients was expanded with RMN for suspicion of mucinous tumor and in 2 patients was performed CPRE for suspected intraductal tumors. Two patients coursed with atelectasis, and one patient had pancreatic fistula grade A and other mild pancreatitis post-operative. No patient was reoperated. There was no mortality post operative. Postoperative was more for the pancreaticoduodenectomy group. In a 2 year follow up, no observed recurrence and all patients are alive. CONCLUSION Preoperative diagnosis is crucial given the differences in natural history of the spectrum of lesions. Despite improved radiographic imaging, techniques, definitive diagnosis is only made after studying the resection sample.</dc:description>
