<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Solid pseudo papillary tumor of the pancreas is considered a neoplasm of low malignant potential. The radicality of surgical approach is controversial. PATIENTS AND METHODS We describe and analyze retrospectively the clinical, radiological, laboratory, operative report and pathology results of seven patients who were diagnosed and operated by solid pseudo papillary tumor of the pancreas in the period 2003 to 2010, in our institution. RESULTS Six patients were female and one male. The median age was 35 years (range: 15-49). The most common symptom was abdominal pain (100%). Jaundice in one patient (14.3%). The radiological appearance mixed solid-cystic was the most common. We performed four Whipple procedures (57.1%), 2 distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy (28.6%), one by laparoscopy and the other by local resection. Morbidity presented in four patients. There was no postoperative mortality or reoperation. Five tumors were located in the pancreatic head (71.4%) and two in the tail (28.6%). The median tumor size was 93 mm (range: 20-150). Two (28.6%) were R1 resections. Four tumors showed malignant behavior (57.1%): splenic capsule and infiltration of metachronous liver metastases (1), infiltration of superior mesenteric artery (1), lymphatic metastasis (1) and synchronous liver metastases, and lymphovascular invasion duodenal infiltration (1). There was no mortality from the disease during the average follow-up of 26 months (range 6-70 months). CONCLUSION Solid pseudo papillary tumor is a neoplasm with high malignant potential in our experience. We recommend an aggressive surgical approach with radical resection including lymphadenectomy.</dc:description>
