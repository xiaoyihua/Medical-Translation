<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Severe malnutrition in young children may lead to long-term complications, in particular learning and psychosocial disorders linked to health related quality of life (HRQOL). The aim of this study was to evaluate HRQOL in children whit a history of severe malnutrition before 2 years of life, expecting to find lower scores in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD A comparative study was performed on schoolchildren between 5 and 12 years with a history of early severe malnutrition, excluding those with chronic diseases. The Controls were healthy siblings of patients. The sample size was estimated as 26 subjects per group (Total=52). Sociodemographic variables were recorded and the HRQOL was assessed with PedsQL4.0. Chi square and Student t test were applied. Significance level: P&lt;.05. RESULTS A total of 25 patients and 28 controls were studied. The HRQOL scores obtained from PedsQL for children with history of malnutrition, compared with their healthy siblings, were: Total: 80.82±1.94 vs 89.18±1.84 P&lt;.0001), physical health/dimension: 87.75±3.37 vs 94.75±1.87 (P&lt;.0001), psychosocial health: 77.77±2.90 vs 86.57±1.42 (P&lt;.0001), emotional dimension: 67.80±4.40 vs 78.75±2.96 (P&lt;.0001), social dimension: 88.80±3.05 vs 95.71±1.52 (P&lt;.0001), and school dimension: 74.58±3.80 vs 85.00±3.51 (P&lt;.0001). CONCLUSIONS Patients with a history of early severe malnutrition, showed significantly lower HRQOL scores compared with controls.</dc:description>
