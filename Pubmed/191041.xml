<dc:description xml:lang="en">Intrathoracic tumors in pediatric ages are unfrequent. A review of 138 cases in patients under 15 years of age showed in the first place, the same as in adults, malignant neoplasms represented by pulmonary metastases. However, in those of primary localization, the histologically benign are more frequent. Out of 69 cases, such tumors came up to 78.2% and 47% of them were cystic malformations. Among malignant primary neoplasms, out of 30.4%, neuroblastoma showed 8.6%, diverse sarcomas were 8.6% and the epithelial type added up to 4.3%. The main symptoms were: frequent bronchopulmonary infections, obstructive respiratory insufficiency and vascular stasis. Radiological examinations are of great diagnostic aid, but a full clinical evaluation is always necessary. A surgical treatment removing the mass leads to radical recovery leaving limited sequelae. The comparative group of 69 cases with pulmonary metastases showed that neoplasms considered of embryonal type are practically always multiple and appear during the final stage of the disease. Surgery may be attempted when they are single and the primary has been removed; however, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are always necessary.</dc:description>
