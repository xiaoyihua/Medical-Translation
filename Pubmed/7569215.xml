<dc:description xml:lang="en">A study on infant mortality was carried out in the Chiqui Gómez health area of Santa Clara City during a 5-year period (1988-1992). Data were collected from the Statistics Department; analyses of familial health records; medical micro-histories of pregnant women in family doctors' home offices; and from the supervision report of the Basic Work Group; diagnostic health status of the area was also taken into account. The method employed was descriptive and analytic. The study is concluded with the evaluation of the fulfillment of the Maternal-Child Program as satisfactory in this health area. Causes of death in the first place were main perinatal disorders and congenital anomalies. Factors having a higher incidence in infant mortality in the study are; short intergenesic period; delivery before the 37th week of pregnancy; pregnancy in adolescence; and low birth weight. There is an evident relationship between pregnancy in adolescence and low birth weight; the results attained in prenatal care and infant care prior to children's death are considered adequate.</dc:description>
