<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies have a pathogenic role in Hashimoto thyroiditis. Between 10 and 19% of individuals without thyroid disease, have positive titers of these antibodies. AIM To study the frequency of positive titers of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies in healthy individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS A blood sample, to measure anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) by chemoluminiscense assay, was obtained from 67women and 62 men aged 45 +/- 14years, without a personal or familiar history of thyroid diseases and normal thyroid palpation. The cutoff point of the manufacturer to consider positive a titer of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies was set at 35 IU/ml. RESULTS Twenty-eight women and 28 men had positive antibody titers (43% of the sample). Subjects in the upper tercile of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody titers had a higher TSH than those in the second tercile, although within normal limits (1.73 +/- 0.74 and 1.37 +/- 0.59 mlU/L, respectively p = 0.02) CONCLUSIONS: Forty three percent of the studied subjects without personal or familial history of thyroid diseases had positive titers of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Further prospective studies should evaluate whether this observation discloses an increase in thyroid autoimmune disease in a population with increased iodine intake.</dc:description>
