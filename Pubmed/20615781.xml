<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid with excellent results in perioperative analgesia. It is commonly used for proximal and distal gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures, but its contracting action on the sphincter of Oddi, similar to that of morphine, makes its use for endoscopic cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) controversial. OBJECTIVE To determinate if intravenous fentanyl as part of deep sedation hinders the cannulation of Vater's papilla during ERCP. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective, comparative, randomized and double-blind trial that enrolled patients undergoing ERCP in 2008, &gt; 18 years old, without previous endoscopic or surgical procedures related with Vater s papilla. Patients were randomized into two groups: patients in whom ERCP was performed with intravenous propofol (group A), and patients in whom the procedure was performed with intravenous fentanyl and propofol (group B). Gender, age, comorbid conditions, reasons for referral, difficulty of cannulation, diagnosis, therapeutic procedures, procedure time and endoscopic complications were all documented. RESULTS 432 were included: 214 in group A and 218 in group B. Both groups were similar in relation with demographic characteristics, time of sedation and endoscopic procedure. Difficulty in cannulation had not a statistical significance (p = 0.163). The administered dose of propofol were less for group B (p &lt; 0.001). No procedure-related mortality was documented. CONCLUSION The combination of fentanyl and propofol may be used during ERCP, since it does not hinder the cannulation of Vater's papilla.</dc:description>
