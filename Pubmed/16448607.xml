<dc:description xml:lang="en">We have studied a 49-year-old patient with a HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B in whom, after 34 months of treatment with lamivudine and associated with an increase in the serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, the lamivudine resistance mutations M204I and L180V were detected. Lamivudine was substituted for adefovir dipivoxil and after 16 months of treatment, in the course of a study to investigate hepatitis B genotypes, the adefovir resistance mutation N236T was detected. HBV viral load in this sample was 3 yen 10(7) UI/ml. Adefovir is considered as the alternative treatment when lamivudine resistance is detected. Appearance of resistance to adefovir is very unusual and in Spain, no case has been communicated yet. However, we must be aware of the adefovir resistance in patients who do not respond to adefovir and it must be confirmed with a resistance study, if possible.</dc:description>
