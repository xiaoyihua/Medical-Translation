<dc:description xml:lang="en">Temporal bone trauma are more common nowadays related to sports. We report 2 cases with temporal bone fractures in patients younger than 14 years. They were two male, 9 and 12-year-old respectively, that presented traumatism after accidental falls from lowe height. The first case had a longitudinal temporal bone fracture without hypoacusia or vertigo, whereas the second one had an oblique fracture involving the otic capsule, provoking permanent neurosensorial hearing loss, as well as vertigo and unsteadiness that resolved later, related to a vestibular hyporreflexia. Neither case had facial paresia or paralysis. CT scanning was essential to determine the importance of the trauma. Despite the otic capsule rupture, hearing loss in the second case was only significant over 2 KHz, suggesting a selective cochlear trauma. We present clinical and imaging findings, as well as correlation of audiological and vestibular alterations, reviewing the clinical presentation of temporal bone trauma in children.</dc:description>
