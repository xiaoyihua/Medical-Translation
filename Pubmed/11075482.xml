<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The prevalence of infection of permanent pacemaker ranges from 0.13 to 19.9%. Our objective is to review our experience and to analyze the epidemiology and treatment of those diagnosed as having pacemaker lead endocarditis. METHODS A retrospective study include all cases diagnosis of pacemaker endocarditis in our hospital, since 1991 to 1998. Eleven patients with pacemaker endocarditis were included. RESULTS Eleven patients were admitted for endocarditis related to pacemaker-lead infection. Fever occurred in nine patients (81.8%). A germ was isolated in nine patients (81.8%) and was a Staphylococcus in eight (88.9%). Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated vegetations in only two patients (18.2%), whereas transesophageal echocardiography disclosed abnormal appearances on the pacemaker lead in eleven patients (100%). Six patients were treated with antibiotics initially and four patients required the removal of the whole infected material after finishing treatment with antibiotic. Five patients were treated since the beginning with a electrode removal who responded favorably. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of endocarditis related to pacemaker infection should be suspected in the presence of fever and patient with pacemaker. Transesophageal echocardiography should be performed to look for vegetations. S. aureus and S. epidermidis are involved in the majority of these infections. The best treatment is an immediate removal of the entire pacing system and antimicrobial therapy.</dc:description>
