<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND DATA Surgery stays as the only effective therapy against gastric cancer. Several factors have been postulated to influence morbidity and mortality risk in gastric cancer surgery. OBJECTIVE Determine morbidity and mortality of gastric cancer surgery and establish risk factors. METHOD We reviewed the charts of patients who underwent surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma. Morbidity and mortality is reported. Demographic factors, preoperative physical evaluation, biochemical parameters, surgical technique and tumor biology were analyzed as risk factors for morbidity and mortality. RESULTS During a seven year period, 120 patients were operated for gastric cancer. Median age was 58.07 years. Subtotal gastrectomy was the most common surgical procedure in 51 patients (42.5%). Morbidity was 26.66% (n = 32). Medical most common complication was renal failure (n = 6, 14.63%) and surgical most common complication was wound infection (n = 7, 17.07%). Mortality was 13.33% (n = 16). Statistically significant risk factors for morbidity were age, ECOG status, Goldman Cardiac Risk Index and a total lymphocyte count. Statistically significant risk factors for mortality were Goldman Cardiac Risk Index, albumin, creatinine, and total lymphocyte count. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality after gastric cancer surgery is influenced by preoperative conditions of patients.</dc:description>
