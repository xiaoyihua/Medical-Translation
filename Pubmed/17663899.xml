<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To examine the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and outcomes in a cohort of children with acute rheumatic fever (RF) over the past 27 years in Montreal. METHODS The medical records of patients younger than 18 years of age hospitalized and diagnosed with RF in Montreal between January 1979 and December 2005 were reviewed. RESULTS Among the initial 134 charts selected, 36 children were already followed-up for chronic RF and the remaining 98 patients (51 % females) who fulfilled the Jones criteria for acute RF were included in the analysis. The mean age at diagnosis was 10.1 +/- 3.0 years (range: 3-17). Over the 27-year study period, there was a mean incidence of 3.6 patients/year without peaks, but onset occurred in the last 15 years in almost two-thirds of the patients. Forty-nine percent of the patients were Canadian-born non-aboriginal (CbnA) and the remaining patients were Canadian-born aboriginal (CbA) or foreign-born (Fb). Carditis was diagnosed in 73 % of the patients and Sydenham's chorea in 49 %. Of the CbnA children, 39 % had carditis compared with 61 % of children from other ethnic groups (P = 0.003). However, the form of presentation was chorea in 69 % of CbnA children vs. 31 % of children from other ethnic groups (P &lt; 0.001). No deaths were attributable to acute RF although 2 % of the patients relapsed during the study period. Severe cardiac sequelae requiring valve replacements occurred in 6.1 %. CONCLUSION The incidence of acute RF in Montreal was low but consistent over the 27-year study period. Clinical presentation varied depending on ethnicity.</dc:description>
