<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Given the differences observed in previous studies with respect to occupational injury rates in Spain's autonomous communities, this study tested the homogeneity hypothesis of occupational injury for specific accident types and economic activity between 1994 and 2004. METHODS We analyzed non-fatal injuries of a mechanical nature or those due to overexertion taking place in manufacturing or construction companies during the workday and requiring sick leave. The relative risk was adjusted for sex, age and contract type in each autonomous community using standardized injury causes for occupational injury, employing Spanish rates as a reference and stratifying by duration of leave (less than 16 days and more than 15 days). RESULTS For the different types of accidents analyzed, the adjusted relative risk of occupational injury was heterogeneously distributed across the autonomous communities. Murcia, Navarre, the Balearic Islands and the Basque Country were generally found to be amongst the communities with the most elevated risks, while Castilla-León and Extremadura were those with the lowest risks of occupational injury. CONCLUSIONS The heterogeneity of occupational injury rates across autonomous communities persisted after selecting a series of specific accident types and adjusting for sex, age and contract type. Therefore, in addition to continued analysis of work conditions to explain this variation, other socioeconomic factors should be taken into account when comparing occupational injury rates among autonomous communities.</dc:description>
