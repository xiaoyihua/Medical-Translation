<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Incidence of use for various renal replacement therapies is well-known, but no data are available on conservative treatment use. OBJECTIVE To assess the proportion of patients with chronic kidney failure receiving a conservative treatment. RESULTS From July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014, 232 patients with stage 5 CKD were seen in the Nephrology Department. After having received information on existing therapeutic options and having known the opinion of their treating physicians, 81 patients (35%) selected hemodialysis, 56 (24%) preferred peritoneal dialysis, 5 (2%) selected a preemptive transplant from a living donor, and in 90 (39%) a conservative treatment option was selected. In a univariate analysis using logistic regression, variables associated to a preference for conservative treatment were age, Charlson index excluding age, degree of walking difficulties, and functional dependence level, with the first three factors achieving statistical significance in a multivariate analysis. Presence of a severe disease resulting in a poor prognosis was the main reason for selecting a conservative treatment (49%), with the second one being patient refusal to receive a renal replacement therapy (26%). Mortality rate was 8.2/100 patient-months in conservative therapy group versus 0.6/100 patient-months in patients receiving renal replacement therapy (P&lt;.001). In patients receiving conservative therapy, baseline glomerular filtration rate at the time of study enrollment was the sole variable showing a significant impact on survival. CONCLUSIONS About 39% of patients with stage 5 CKD seen over a 1-year period in the Nephrology Department received conservative therapy. Age, co-morbidity, and functional disability were the factors associated to selecting a conservative therapy option.</dc:description>
