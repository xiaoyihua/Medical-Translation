<dc:title xml:lang="en">Application of new information and communication methodologies (ict) for laboratory teaching in applied physics and physical chemistry</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) will change our teaching methodology with the implementation of new teaching strategies and greater participation of students in the learning process. The objective of our study is to evaluate the students&#146; views in three main areas: a) teaching strategies promoted by the lecturer for the teaching/learning process, b) evaluation methods and c) achieve good competence in other areas such as oral communication skills or team-work. Thus we designed a questionnaire which was filled by Pharmacy students from various years (n=118; 40.5% males and 59.5% females) registered in several subjects. Analysis of data revealed that 93.1% considered that attendance to lectures helped them to understand the topics covered. A good proportion (82.8%) was also of the view that participating in lectures was a good aid to learning. The students valued the teachers explanations and the use of the blackboard as the most useful for them to learn followed by practicals and exercises and lastly by PowerPoint presentations. Our data suggest that students value strategies that make them participate in their own learning process as well as a system of continuing evaluation. The results obtained highlight the importance of teaching strategies which stimulate student participation but also the high value the students allocate to the most classic and characteristic features of any classroom: teacher and blackboard(AU)</dc:description>

<dc:description xml:lang="es">The aim of this innovative teaching work is the improvement in the learning process of laboratory practical sessions of the subject &#145;Applied Physics and Physical Chemistry&#146; of the Pharmacy degree syllabuses at the University of Granada. The laboratory practical sessions of several subjects in this Faculty have been traditionally carried out with the collaboration of &#145;laboratory demonstrators&#146;, who help to their classmates in the performance of the experiments, being always coordinated and supervised by a senior professor. This system has however some handicaps and limitations. With this project, we expect on one hand the figure of &#145;laboratory demonstrators&#146; to disappear, and on the other hand to achieve that the student is more receptive and shows a higher interest in the practical sessions.Our experience proves that it is very important for the student to visualize the manipulation and methodology needed for the performance of the experiments in the laboratory. The new audiovisual Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) provide very didactic tools, which make the learning more attractive. With this purpose, we have prepared a DVD movie of each experiment planned in the practical sessions of the subject. These movies show the manipulation of the material and reagents, the use of specific instrumentation, good behaviour in the laboratory, and data acquisition and analysis, with the aim of guiding the student in the experimental work. The student will perform the experiments simultaneously to the movie projection, with the possibility of interacting with the movie itself and the senior professor present during the session. In short, we expect to enhance the motivation and own-initiative of the students, facilitating their self-learning, by means of an innovative teaching methodology that contributes to promote the adaptation to the European Space for Higher Education(AU)</dc:description>
