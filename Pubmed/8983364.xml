<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To study the delay time to arrive of the hospital and its relation with any variables, of patients with acute myocardial infarction from the province of Teruel (Spain). PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective study was carried out from January 1991 to October 1994. We included patients who were diagnosticated of the acute myocardial infarction (212 men and 63 women). We considered the time between the thoracic pain and their arrive at the urgency service. We based the diagnosis in clinical, electrocardiographic and enzymatic criteria. RESULTS The mean delay time was 8 h 46 m. The 66.5% arrives before 6 hours. We found no differences between rural or urban patients. The delay time was minor in men than women (7 h 12 m versus 14 h, p = 0.0019), in younger (&lt; 65 years old) than in the older (6 h 3 m versus 10 h 18 m, p = 0.0278), and in those who were admitted to the ICU (7h 16 m versus 20 h 33 m, p = 0.0001). Was longer in patients with arterial hypertension and diabetes. Was minor in patients with dyslipemia and tobacco habit. Many patients to arrive of the hospital by physician order and with own vehicles, it took less time arrive at the hospital than by ambulance (8 h 30 m versus 18 h, p &lt; 0.05). The medium delay in the emergency area was 2 h 35 m. The delay time was longer in patients who died (16 h versus 7h 30 m, p = 0.0018) and in those who present more frequently cardiac failure. CONCLUSIONS The mean delay time to arrive at the hospital in patients with acute myocardial infarction from the province of Teruel (Spain) in unreasonable and in takes a poor prognosis, so we consider necessary to study the causes of this delay in order to correct them.</dc:description>
