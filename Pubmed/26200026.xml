<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The aim of this study is to describe antibiotic consumption in the Region of Murcia in 2011, within the Spanish and European context, as well as to analyze the differences within the Region, both between health areas, and between users of the regional health service and those protected by the civil servants' mutual insurance society (MUFACE). METHODS Retrospective observational study of prescriptions dispensed by the pharmacies in the Region of Murcia during 2011. Consumption rates were expressed as defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 inhabitants/day and standardized consumption ratios (SCR). RESULTS Overall antibiotics consumption rate in the Region of Murcia in 2011 was 30.05 DDD/1000/ day (DID), which is much above the average rate for Spain (20.9 DID) and for the European Union (21.57 DID). Health areas within the Region with the highest and lowest consumption rate are, respectively, Vega Alta (SCR: 124.44; CI95% 124.26 to 124.61) and Cartagena (SCR:84.16; CI95% 84.10 to 84.22). Civil servants covered by the mutual society have higher consumption rates than users of the regional health service (SCR: 105.01; CI95% 104.86 to 105.17). CONCLUSIONS There is a high level of antibiotic prescription in the Region of Murcia Region in relative terms. A great variability in antibiotics consumption was observed between the different health areas, which might be related to the higher rate of the frequency of visits. The highest amount of variability in antibiotics prescription was found in cephalosporins and macrolides.</dc:description>
