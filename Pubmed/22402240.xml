<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To evaluate the perceived health status of elderly patients with insomnia, whether primary, secondary to a medical illness, or associated with another mental disorder. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study in a representative sample of 926 persons aged over 65 years. A psychiatric interview was used to verify the presence of insomnia (DSM-IV-TR, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth ed., revised text). Interviews were conducted by health professionals to assess perceived health status (EuroQol-5D), health problems, and socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS The prevalence of primary insomnia was 8.9% (95% CI: 7.1-11.0), that of insomnia associated with another mental disorder was 9.3% (95% CI: 7.5-11.4) and that of insomnia secondary to medical illness was 7.0% (95% CI: 5.4-8.9). Patients with insomnia who used hypnotics/sedatives scored lower in self-reported health (57.6; 95% CI: 53.7-61.4), significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) than participants with insomnia not taking these drugs (65.1; 95% CI: 53.7-61.4). The mean health status score in individuals without insomnia was 0.87 and was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) in persons with any type of insomnia: 0.80 in primary insomnia, 0.73 in insomnia secondary to a mental disorder and 0.76 in insomnia associated with medical illness. CONCLUSIONS Health status was worse in older people with insomnia, whether primary, secondary to other mental illnesses or organic, and when the elderly patients consumed hypnotics/sedatives. Limitations were less severe in primary insomnia.</dc:description>
