<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the epidemiology of skin surgery performed in the dermatology department of Hospital Clínico Universitario in Valencia, Spain, on children up to 16 years of age. The study analyzed a 9-year period. MATERIALS AND METHOD A retrospective review was performed of all tissue excisions and biopsies taken between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2007, from patients up to 16 years of age seen in the dermatology department of Hospital Clínico Universitario. The following data were collected: age, sex, surgical site, and histopathologic diagnosis. RESULTS Between 1990 and 2007, 33840 lesions were analyzed histologically; 996 of the lesions (2.94%) were from patients up to 16 years of age, of whom 502 (50.40%) were girls and 484 (49.60%) were boys. The mean age was 11.06 years. The majority (47.39%) of excisions were performed in children of 12 to 16 years. The distribution of the remainder by age groups was as follows: &lt;1 year, 34 excisions (3.41%); &gt;1 to &lt;4 years, 66 (6.63%); &gt;4 to &lt;8 years, 154 (15.46%); and &gt;8 to &lt;12 years, 270 (27.11%). The most common diagnosis was melanocytic nevus (50.20%), followed by pilomatrixoma (4.62%), capillary angioma (3.61%), epidermal cyst (3.61%), Spitz nevus (3.31%), and pyogenic granuloma (3.11%). CONCLUSION Dermatologic surgery in patients up to 16 years of age accounted for a small percentage of the overall dermatologic surgery in our hospital; the majority of children were in the 12 to &lt;16 year age group. Most children had benign lesions, with melanocytic nevus being by far the most common diagnosis. The majority of lesions were on the trunk, followed by the head and neck. In conclusion, compared with the literature reviewed, ours is the only series on dermatologic surgery in children. It is of interest because it defines the most common conditions in these patients.</dc:description>
