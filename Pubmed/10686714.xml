<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical and biological characteristics of a series of patients with megaloblastic anemia (MA) and to identify potential differences between patients with pernicious anemia (PA(+)) and patients with other MA (PA(-)). METHOD Retrospective study of 50 patients with MA diagnosed in our service between 1993 and 1998. RESULTS MA was diagnosed in 50 patients. The median age in the moment of diagnosis was 70.7 years. The causes of MA were: cobalamin deficiency (CD) in 40 cases (80%), folate deficiency (FD) in 7 cases (14%) and both deficiencies in 3 cases (6%). PA was diagnosed in 19 patients (38%). All cases showed hyper-segmented neutrophils and 41 cases (81%) macroovalocytosis. Hemoglobin level &lt; 8 g/dl was present in 22 patients (44%). The median serum LDH level was 2.059 +/- 1.739 U/l. There was a lower frequency of female sex and a higher RDW in the group PA(+). There were no significant differences between both groups in the rest of studied features, except for the presence of antiparietal cell antibodies and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies in the group PA(+). CONCLUSIONS CD was the most frequent cause of MA in our series. PA was the most frequent cause of CD. Most cases of MA corresponded to a severe macrocytic anemia with hyper-segmented neutrophils, macroovalocytosis and very high serum LDH level. We did not identify any clinical or biological characteristic, except for the presence of antiparietal cell antibodies and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies and a higher RDW in the group PA(+), to permit distinguish the groups PA(+) and PA(-).</dc:description>
