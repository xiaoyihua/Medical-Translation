<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND It has been proved that a breast reconstruction after a mastectomy has a great psycho-social impact on patients. For this reason, it is increasingly done in a greater percentage of cases. There are two major groups of reconstructive techniques: a reconstruction with implants and a reconstruction with autologous tissue of the patient. In order to make a more objective assessment of the results, it is important to know how satisfied these patients are with the results. Therefore, we performed a study using Q-BREAST, the aim of which is to analyze the satisfaction of mastectomized patients according to the different surgical reconstruction techniques. METHODS A retrospective, descriptive and observational study of patients reconstructed in our service from 2008 to 2011 was carried out. Patient satisfaction levels were compared according to the surgical technique used in breast reconstruction using the Q-BREAST test, which was mailed to them. RESULTS There are no statistical differences in the levels of satisfaction in terms of age, type of mastectomy done, coadjutant treatment or existence of complications. Higher levels of satisfaction are observed in patients reconstructed with autologous tissue versus implants (P=.028). CONCLUSIONS Patients reconstructed with autologous tissue have higher levels of satisfaction than those reconstructed with implants.</dc:description>
