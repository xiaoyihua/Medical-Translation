<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a high prevalent disease associated with the metabolic syndrome. It is unknown whether general practitioners have an appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this pathology. OBJECTIVE To determine the level of knowledge on NAFLD of general practitioners of two districts of the province of Chiclayo during 2012. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cross sectional design; 60 practitioners were selected and interviewed by a non-probabilistic consecutive sampling, using a validated instrument of 13 questions. Data were processed using SPSS v15. RESULTS Only in 45% of the general practitioners a sufficient knowledge was found. No association was found between the level of knowledge with the university of origin, the number of years of graduated nor the antecedent of previously had diagnosed at least one case of NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS The level of knowledge in NAFLD in the general practitioners interviewed from Chiclayo was insufficient.</dc:description>
