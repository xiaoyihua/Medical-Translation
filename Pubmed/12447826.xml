<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Language is almost always affected in fragile X syndrome (FXS) and a delay in language acquisition is one of the first characteristics. They articulate poorly and have a repetitive language, using the last word or sentence they have said or have been told. They have a tendency to change subjects as they talk and to repeat what they have heard. Even if comprehension is correct, they are unable to answer questions. Sometimes this is due to the fact that they don't expect the question or because they are not paying attention. They react better to short and concise commands. Their speech is fast with a poor control of the rhythm and inappropriate pausing in words, making it difficult to understand them. Some children with severe language dysfunction will require a complementary communication system to aid them. DEVELOPMENT In speech therapy we will improve their communicative skills, both in comprehension as in expression, minimising or eliminating negative patterns, with exercises, techniques and strategies. Work is needed on the use of alternative language if necessary and finally work on feeding problems caused by the low muscular tone and on sensorial problems such as tactile hyper/hypo stimulation or difficulties to plan their movements. In conclusion, we must bear in mind that each child is different and so are their specific needs. CONCLUSION We must know the individualities to provide for opportunities of development or of their control, and focus our objectives in a more real and effective manner.</dc:description>
