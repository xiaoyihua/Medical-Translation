<dc:description xml:lang="en">The introduction of etiological, diagnostic and therapeutical factors have modified the knowledge on the evolutive behaviour of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH). Mortality and morbidity associated to spontaneous ICH were assessed using as independent variables clinical and neuroimage factors obtained upon admission of the patients. We studied 228 patients with spontaneous ICH selected from a data bank of 277 patients with non-traumatic ICH. During the first 24 hours, we assessed several clinical factors (arterial hypertension, Glasgows Neurological Scale and Barthels Scale) and TC images (size, location, extension of bleeding to ventricles, edema and atrophy). Thirty-one per cent of the patients died during the first 2 months. The multiple linear regression study showed that mortality was related to variables of the Glasgows Neurological Scale upon admission, extension to ventricles, size of ICH and perilesional edema, whereas the morbidity was only related to the size of the hemorrhage. Severity of the clinical affection, extension of the bleeding to ventricles, size of the hemorrhage and presence of perilesional edema, but not arterial hypertension, were the main factors affecting mortality at two months of spontaneous ICH.</dc:description>
