<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the foregoing investigation breast-feeding during the first 30 days of life was studied in a representative sample of 620 babies born and settled down in the city of Cordoba Argentina. To analyse this information, the classification of breastfeeding suggested by the WHO/UNICEF was used. The results reveal that being a month old, 26% of the babies had complete breastfeeding 60% had partial breastfeeding and the remaining 14% did not have it at all. Among the children with complete breast-feeding, 21% was exclusive and 5% was prevailing. 18% of the babies were exposed to breastfeeding before an hour and a half after they were born, the average number of nursings a day was 7.3 (D.S. 1.9) taking less than 15 minutes to reach the 57%; and with a free-demanding timetable in 44%. The children with partial breast-feeding were classified into low, medium, and high being 20%, 54%, 22% respectively. The average age in which another milk was introduced was 3.7 days, and the main reasons were "insufficient mother milk", and "the child's hunger". Among the children with artificial lactation, 87% were once exposed to breastfeeding, the weaning took place during the 4 days in average (D.S. 5.6) and in an abrupt way in 55% of them. The Health personnel helped supporting the introduction of lacteal formula in 68% of the children with partial lactation and in 42% of the cases of complete abandon of natural breastfeeding.</dc:description>
