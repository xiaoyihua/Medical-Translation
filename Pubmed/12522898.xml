<dc:description xml:lang="en">Comfort, safety and time saving makes air travel more and more popular and widely use by an increased number of people in a range of extended age frame. Recent concerns in the global news have again raised an issue about the association of thromboembolic disease and air travel. Although there are numerous studies in the literature examining venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), variability of population demographics makes difficult a right and prospective assessment in the context of the cabin environment and air travel. Literature review clearly demonstrate that VTE is multicausal in nature, resulting in differing etiologic and predisposing factors across different age groups. Many questions are still to be answered, How many cases?, Direct association to Air Travel?, How to prevent it in the aviation environment? In this paper we analyze the incidence of VTE and some additional epidemiological aspects, risk and predisposing factors, diagnostic, and preventive measures given by the airline, the user, aviation authorities, aeromedical especialist in order to cope this complication. Finally we discuss the physiopathological bases in which VTE is developed and related considerations of this syndrome in the context of the aviation environment.</dc:description>
