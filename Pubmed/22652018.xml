<dc:description xml:lang="en">Infection in the acute phase of stroke has been identified as an independent predictor of poor outcome, both in the short and intermediate term. Various factors raising the risk of developing an infection (exposure to multiple pathogens, disruption of the protective function of the mucous membranes and a state of relative immunosuppression) coexist during the acute phase of stroke. Several risk factors have been identified for their development (especially increasing age and stroke severity). It has been proposed that infection contributes to a worse prognosis through different mechanisms, notably the development of an inflammatory response to brain tissue (with a potential to add secondary damage to that caused by the ischemic insult). Clinical trials evaluating the prophylactic and early administration of antibiotics to reduce the incidence of infection in the acute phase of stroke have yielded inconsistent results. Immunomodulating strategies, which may provide therapeutic alternatives in the future, are currently being evaluated.</dc:description>
