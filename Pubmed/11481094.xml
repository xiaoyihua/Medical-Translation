<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The effectiveness of a given treatment is only achieved with a due compliance. Our objective was to know the compliance degree of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in menopausal women. METHOD A descriptive observational study was carried out in three hospitals in the Valencia Community (Spain). We included menopausal patients who were visited in a menopause unit from 1989 to 1999 and who were administered HRT. We analyzed age, age at menopause, type of menopause, age at starting HRT, education level, prescription reason, treatment duration, information level, side effects, and causes leading to withdrawal. RESULTS The study was performed in 363 women. There were 75% probabilities that women fulfilled the therapy for 5 years. The median of fulfillment was 11 years. Those women who had side effects were more prone to withdraw the treatment. By contrast, women who experienced benefits were less prone to withdraw it. Risk of withdrawal was also lower in cases of postsurgery menopause and in women who were younger than 55 years when they started HRT. CONCLUSIONS In our study, the compliance level was high and it was determined either by treatment benefits or side effects, type of menopause and age at starting HRT.</dc:description>
