How to write a great documentation (in 5 points)

1. Use question and answer look (more like FAQs)
2. Use pointers wherever possible
    a. maximum 5, preferably 3
    b. if goes beyond 5, try making sub-points instead
3. Diagrams wherever possible. a ðŸ–¼ is worth a 1000 words
4. Be precise, but accurate. And have  w h i t e  s p a c e s , increases readability.
5. Avoid similar synonyms, generous adjectives, spellnig and grammatical the mistakes
    a. repeat same words already used to refer something
    b. have links to go to something previously explained
    c. Avoid external links, instead provide a brief. Add link only for confidence (reduces distraction)
