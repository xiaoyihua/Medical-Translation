<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Leukotrienes participate in certain biological activities such as contraction of human airway muscle, increased vascular permeability, chemotaxis and allergen-induced early and late responses. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the leukotriene antagonist montelukast in patients with atopic dermatitis unresponsive to traditional treatment. METHODS Eighteen children with atopic dermatitis were treated with 5 mg of chewable montelukast every 24 hs during a period of 24 weeks. Patient's history was utilized as a control for each individual. On each visit, every child was assessed by a single observer and objectively scored for disease extent and severity. In addition every parent filled a similar evaluation. RESULTS There was statistical improvement (p &lt; 0.01) when values before and after treatment were analyzed, although no improvement was reported in five. No adverse reactions were reported. CONCLUSION Findings suggest that leukotriene antagonists can be used as an adjunct treatment on patients with atopic dermatitis that are refractory to traditional management.</dc:description>
