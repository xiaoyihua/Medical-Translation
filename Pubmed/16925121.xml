<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Evaluating the role of the main factors associated with high-risk cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in women from the Cauca Department in Colombia. METHODOLOGY After signing a consent-form, women were interviewed to obtain socio-demographic and lifestyle data. A cervical biopsy was performed on each woman for histopathological diagnosis (cases) and a sample of exfoliated cells (cases and controls) to extract DNA for HPV detection by polymerase chain reaction. A total of 98 cases and 109 controls, matched by age and ethnicity, were recruited for the study. RESULTS The study confirmed association between HPV and the risk of cervical neoplasia (OR = 19.0; 95% CI = 8.20-44.2). The data suggested that multiparity (OR = 4.1; 95% CI = 1.62-10.6) and exposure to carcinogens present in wood-smoke (OR = 7.3; 95% CI = 3.00-19.4) are important co-factors for cervical neoplasia given the presence of HPV. CONCLUSIONS These results provide valuable information for public health institutions to develop better cervical neoplasia prevention programmes.</dc:description>
