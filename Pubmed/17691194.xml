<dc:description xml:lang="en">The enlightened magic showed off by Philippe V during the first stage of his reign, was shattered because of two basic biographic misfortunes: first, to contract second marriage with Isabel Farnesio, a biting female personality that turned him into a sexual and emotional dependent person; second, the bipolar disorder associated with other mental disorders, above all obsessive personality and Cotard's syndrome. The bipolar disorder was characterized according to the prevalence of melancholic episodes. In this way, the opposite pole appeared only in form of hipomanic rises as reaction to a warlike event, in general experienced by him as a positive stimulus. The course of his melancholy together with Cotard's syndrome was progressive worsening and became continuous starting from the seventh episode when this enlightened king was 52 years old.</dc:description>
