<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Ecstasy use have raised in recent years and it have been related to psychopathological symptoms. The comsumption pattern associated with psychiatric complications is unknown. METHOD Thirty-six case reports about psychiatric complications due to ecstasy and published from 1985 to 1997 were studied. RESULTS The disorders with higher prevalence were psychosis (n = 21), panic attacks (n = 12) and depressive symptoms (n = 3). Seventy two per cent were substance abusers. Urinary drugs screening were present in 28%, only in two subjects might detect amphetamine. Men had higher MDMA doses compsumption and higher prevalence of background psychiatric disorders than women. Subjects with psychotic symptomatology had more psychiatric background, higher doses of MDMA comsumption and for a long time than individuals with depressive or panic attacks symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS The review of the case reports of psychiatric complications related to ecstasy use do not allow to conclude that ecstasy use was the main responsible factor for psychiatric symptoms. They could be related to an individual vulnerability and or to lasting of comsumption.</dc:description>
