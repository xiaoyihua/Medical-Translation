<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study w trial randomized as to investigate the frequencies of human papillomavirus (HPV) and mutation in Ha-ras oncogene and tumour suppressor p53 gene in cervical cancer and precursor lesions. A total of 30 invasive carcinomas (IC), 36 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (CIN III) and 12 normal tissues adjacent to the tumor (NT) were included. HPV typification and scanning of possible mutations in Ha-ras and p 53 genes were made by SSCP-PCR. The IC cases showed 93% HPV positivity, 41% having mobility shifts for Ha-ras mutations and 17% for p53 mutations while in CIN III, these percentages were 80%, 18% and 11%, respectively. In normal tissues HPV frequency was 17%. All Ha-ras mutated samples were HPV positive but 33% of p53 mutated cases were HPV negative. All mutations were heterozygous. HPV 16 was more prevalent (44%) than HPV 18 (15%) and the high rate of undetermined HPV types (18%) would indicate the circulation in our country of other types different from the assayed HPV controls (6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 33), being variants or mixed infections. The low frequency of p53 mutations (17%) strengthens the view that wild type p53 inactivation by HPV probably plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. Because mutated Ha-ras was found in HPV associated premalignant lesions, we speculate that it represents an early marker for progression. Our findings provide additional evidence for an interactive effect between high risk types of HPV and oncogene activation in the development of uterine cervical cancer.</dc:description>
