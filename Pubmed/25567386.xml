<dc:description xml:lang="en">The high prevalence of allergic diseases and the use of more complex diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options require allergists to be highly trained professionals and health-care organizations to be knowledgeable about available structural and human resources. Updated information is lacking in Spain, and current activity indicators do not reflect complexity. The present article analyzes the situation of allergology in Madrid and proposes improvements where necessary. The heads of the allergy departments of public hospitals in Madrid voluntarily completed a purpose-designed survey. Data on care activity (2010) and on teaching and research activity (2009-2010) were provided. A SWOT analysis was performed, and strategic lines and proposals for improvement were designed. One hundred and seventeen allergists (41% with a PhD) worked in 24 hospitals with an allergology department (4.6 physicians/center; ≤3 in 10 hospitals). All the institutions had an outpatient clinic (4,000 first consultations/hospital/year, 36% high-resolution rate; 6200 successive visits/hospital/year) performing complex diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, most of which were not taken into account by activity indicators. Two hospitals had their own hospitalization facilities and 10 were accredited teaching hospitals (2.78 medical residents/year). The survey revealed that, twice yearly, a typical allergology service participated in 4 research projects, 2 clinical trials, 16 publications and 17 communications at scientific meetings, with notable differences between hospitals. Allergists in Madrid are well prepared. The allergology care structure is adequate, although possibly insufficient. Quality and efficiency can be improved with new tools for recording activity and by increasing coordination and taking advantage of new technologies and geographical proximity.</dc:description>
