<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the preterm neonate (PTN) with respiratory distress is frequent and there are controversies related to its medical and/or surgical treatment. The goal of the present study was to compare the outcome between the two groups of newborns with PDA, operated (group A) and not operated on (group B); and to determine the internal diameter (DI) in ductus arteriosus (DA) on outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS The clinical records of PTN hospitalized from January 1999 to January 2002, discharged either by improvement or death, were retrolectively analyzed. Statistical analysis was carried out using the descriptive and inferential statistic. The statistical significance was considered at p&lt;0.05. RESULTS The was significant difference in DI in DA in favor group A with p&lt;0.01; and DI of 2 mm or more showed significant difference too in favor of group A with a p=0.0006. The mortality was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS We concluded that in the PTN with significant PDA should intervene medical or surgically and without those data but with DI of 2 mm or more of DA, also.</dc:description>
