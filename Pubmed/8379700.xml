<dc:description xml:lang="en">From a series of 5000 cases that had undergone extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy at the Hospital Clinico Quirúrgico "Hermanos Ameijeiras" from March, 1986 to April, 1988, 220 cases that required percutaneous nephrostomy due to obstructive hydronephrosis from stone fragments were studied. We analyzed the clinical, radiological and ultrasound features of these cases, as well as the criteria for performing percutaneous nephrostomy. We identified the risk factors that made the procedure necessary, particularly urinary tract infection. No important complications ascribable to the foregoing procedure were observed. Performing the procedure early improved patient clinical course and reduced cost of treatment. To eliminate stone fragments completely, percutaneous nephrostomy was combined with other procedures in 198 cases (90%). The stone fragments were passed spontaneously in 10 cases (4.5%) following diversion. At 2 months 190 cases (86%) were completely stone free, 18 (8%) had residual stones and 12 (6%) required open surgery. The foregoing results show that percutaneous nephrostomy is a very useful procedure in septic-obstructive complications following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and acquiring the skill to perform it is essential.</dc:description>
