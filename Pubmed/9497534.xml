<dc:description xml:lang="en">Toxocariosis is a zoonosis which has been widely studied in dogs. However, not much is known about this parasitosis in cats. The aim of the present work was to determine the frequency of Toxocara cati in domestic cats in Mexico City and the State of Mexico. Feces of 660 domestic cats were studied by the Faust concentration-floating test; 401 samples were from cats living in Mexico City of which 308 lived in houses and 93 in apartments; 231 were from urban areas of the State of Mexico and 28 from a rural area of the same state. The total frequency of T. cati eggs obtained from domestic cats in Mexico City was 42.9%; in cats living in apartments it was 18.3% and in cats living in houses it was 50.3%. In domestic cats from the State of Mexico, T. cati frequency was 36.4% in the urban and 21.4% in the rural areas. We consider that toxocariosis frequency observed at the two studied sites is high and that the need to prevent dissemination of the infectious forms of T. cati is urgent, as is the necessity of informing the population of the risk of living with T. cati parasited animals and of the anatomopathological alterations caused by T. cati in man.</dc:description>
