<dc:description xml:lang="en">Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently have skeletal muscle dysfunction, of either respiratory muscles or those located of the limbs. This dysfunction may appear even at relatively early stages and it conditions symptoms and patient's quality of life. In the case of respiratory muscles, factors that seem to determine muscle dysfunction are, particularly, changes in thorax configuration and an unbalance between decreased energy availability and increased energy demands by the muscle. However, respiratory muscles show signs of structural and metabolic adaptation to this situation, partially compensating the above-mentioned deleterious effects. However, at muscles of the limbs, particularly of the lower limbs, dysfunction seems to be essentially due to deconditioning by physical activity reduction. Structural changes in these muscles are involutional in nature. At both respiratory and peripheral muscles, other factors such as nutritional impairments, inflammation, oxidative stress, some drugs, and the presence of comorbidity seem to play a relevant role. All of them will condition both dysfunction and structural changes, which will be heterogeneous for the different muscle groups in each patient.</dc:description>
