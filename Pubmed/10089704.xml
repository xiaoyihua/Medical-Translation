<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to verify the early effects that the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) produces on thrombocytopenia and its possible relationship to portal pressure and the size of the spleen. A TIPS was placed in 24 cirrhotic patients (11 women and 13 men) with a mean age of 57.6 +/- 12.3 years. Prior to the test the platelets count, the size of the spleen and the portocaval gradient were determined. The same parameters were evaluated one day and one month afterwards. A significant increase was observed in then number of platelets following the placement of the prosthesis (87.6 +/- 55.2 vs 97 +/- 66.8 x 10(9)/l) (p &lt; 0.05) which was maintained in the monthly control without achieving statistical significance (99.5 +/- 60.8 x 10(9)/l). A significant decrease was also observed in the size of the spleen from 156.7 +/- 28.7 mm during the previous control to 144.5 +/- 19.9 mm in the monthly control (p &lt; 0.05). The portocaval gradient was significantly reduced following the procedure with the values being 23.25 +/- 3.86 mmHg prior to the TIPS, 10.29 +/- 3.84 mmHg in the immediate control and 10.37 +/- 4.81 mmHg at the one month control. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the size of the spleen and the number of platelets in both the previous control (r = 0.7264; p &lt; 0.001) and in the monthly control (r = 0.5764; p &lt; 0.05), between the size of the spleen and the portocaval gradient prior to the test (r = 0.5285; p &lt; 0.05) and at one month (r = 0.7185; p &lt; 0.01) and between the portocaval gradient and the number of platelets before the prosthesis (r = 0.5060; p &lt; 0.05). TIPS may improve the thrombocytopenia in correlation with the decrease in portal pressure.</dc:description>
