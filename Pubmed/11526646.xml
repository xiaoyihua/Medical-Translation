<dc:description xml:lang="en">By the moment, craniocorpographic record of the Romberg test has been scarcely used in clinical practice. Since craniocorpography is a method for recording oscillations of the head and shoulders, it can show characteristic patterns in patients with vertigo caused by increased muscle tension in the neck. In order to confirm this hypothesis, a prospective comparative study was performed with 329 patients. They were included in three different groups: patients with cervical vertigo, patients with vestibular pathology and a healthy control group. Movements of the head (with static shoulders) are more usual in patients with cervical vertigo (67%) than in those with vestibular pathology (27%) and healthy subjects (31%). With regard to the kind of head oscillations, front-back flexions and oscillations in all directions were the most frequent (36% and 34%, respectively). Nevertheless, the only movements previously reported (cervical rotation or torsion) only were 3% of total head movements in our study. We concluded that static craniocorpography is an useful method in diagnosing vertigo secondary to increased muscle tension in the neck.</dc:description>
