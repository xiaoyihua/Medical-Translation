<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE [corrected] Determine the extent to which levels of glycosylated hemoglobin levels among type 2 sedentary diabetic patients change when performing aerobic exercises two or three times a week. SETTING Mexican Institute Social Security, Family Medicine Unit, primary care level. STUDY DESIGN Controlled clinical trial. METHODS AND SUBJETS: Two groups of 25 participants carried out a comprehensive exercise routine 2 or 3 times per week in alternate days. Measurements were done at baseline, 8 and 16 weeks. HbA1c, aerobic capacity, BMI and compliance were assesed. OUTCOME There was no significant difference in HbA1c between the two study groups, however both groups showed lower levels of HbA1c when comparing their baseline and follow up levels (p &lt; 0.001). No significant association was found between Hb1Ac, aerobic capacity or BMI. Compliance was higher among the group exercising 2 days. CONCLUSION Moderate aerobic exercise was well tolerated showing a significant decrease on HbA1c even among the 2 day group.</dc:description>
