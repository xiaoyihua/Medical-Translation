<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To show the advantages of the use of vaginal misoprostol, a prostaglandine E1 analogue, in the prevention of the post-partum haemorrhage. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a prospective, observational, comparative study. The study included 400 patients with high risk of postpartum haemorrhage at our center between January 1999 and may 2001. Patients were divided in two groups. In group I (208 patients) misoprostol was used in a dose of 800 ugr and in group II (192 patients) in whom misoprostol was not used. Both groups were treated initially with our conventional oxytocin protocol. We evaluated the use of additional oxytocin or ergotamine, haemoglobin levels pre and post-partum, the amount of blood loss, and the need for blood transfusion or hysterectomy. RESULTS The need for additional oxytocin or ergotamine was reduced to less than 10% in group I when compared to group II; the drop in haemoglobin levels and the amount of blood loss were also less in group I (p: 0.03). In this group only one patient needed for blood transfusion and no patient needed hysterectomy. In group II six patients need a blood transfusion and there was the need for two hysterectomies. CONCLUSION The use of vaginal misoprostol is effective to control the postpartum bleeding, reducing the blood loss after birth in women with high risk of post-partum haemorrhage as well as the need for blood transfusion. It's use has mild side effects and is of low cost.</dc:description>
