<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Neuroendocrine tumors are rare neoplasms which have a slow growth pattern. When liver metastases are diagnosed, treatment is controversial and it is focused in symptomatic control. AIM To present a patient with a neuroendocrine tumor that arised from the ileocecal valve and it was diagnosed with carcinoid syndrome and treated with radical liver and colonic resection. A discussion of the different forms of treatment is presented. CASE REPORT A 41 year-old woman was sent to our hospital with liver metastases and carcinoid syndrome from a neuroendocrine tumor of the ileocecal valve for treatment. Right colectomy, right hepatic trisectionectomy and radiofrequency ablation of two left sided lesions was performed as a first procedure. A second procedure was performed two months afterwards when resection of residual left sided lesions was done. After a two year follow up a 2 cm residual liver lesion was diagnosed and percutaneous radiofre-quency ablation was done. After four years of follow up the patient has been asymptomatic without tumor recurrence CONCLUSIONS Radical surgical treatment of neu-roendocrine tumors controls symptomatology, improving quality of life and survival. However, this treatment should only be performed in a well selected group of patients.</dc:description>
