<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cannulation of the axillary artery is one possible means of establishing cardiopulmonary bypass during surgery of the ascending aorta and aortic arch. Use of a Dacron graft for cannulation has a number of advantages. In this article, we report our experience with this technique in seven consecutive patients in whom we performed an ascending aorta replacement. The associated procedures involved were aortic root reconstruction using David's procedure in two patients, the Bentall procedure in one, the hemi-arch technique in two, the complete arch and elephant trunk technique in one, aortic valve repair in one, and Valsalva sinus reconstruction in one. Circulatory arrest with antegrade cerebral perfusion was carried out in three cases. There was no in-hospital mortality, and there were no vascular or infectious complications related to axillary access. One patient presented with transient paresthesia of the brachial plexus. In all cases, cardiopulmonary bypass flow was adequate.</dc:description>
