<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Sleep disorders can affect daytime functioning in a variety of neurodevelopmental disabilities as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Asperger syndrome. DEVELOPMENT Researchers using behavioural and/or electrophysiological measures have identified differences in sleep architecture among people with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other developmental disorders. Children with neurodevelopmental disabilities have significant sleep problems, most commonly disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep. Studies of sleep disturbance in children with academic and behavioural problems have underscored the role that primary sleep disorders play in the clinical presentation of symptoms of inattention and behavioural dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS Identification and treatment of sleep disorders in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities may improve daytime behaviour in this patients. When establishing a treatment plan, it is imperative to understand the underlying etiology of the sleep problem, which in many cases is multifactorial.</dc:description>
