<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND AIM Patients arriving in Paediatric Emergency Departments due to alcohol abuse is fairly common. The aim of this study is to determine the profile of the patients seen in the emergency room for acute ethanol intoxication. MATERIAL AND METHOD A descriptive study was performed on all patients seen in the emergency department with an acute ethanol intoxication over a 12-month period (2007). Patients with accidental poisoning or with related chronic illness were excluded. RESULTS A total of 104 patients were included (50% males). Their mean age was 16.2 years (standar desviation [SD] 1.2 years); 95.8% were older than 14 years. There was on patient who was seen twice for the same reason. The majority, 72.4%, were seen on holiday days; 82.9%, from 8:00 pm to 8:00 am. A total of 81.9% of the patients were brought in by ambulance. No cases of hypoglycaemia were detected and 7.5% of the patients had hypothermia. Ethanol levels and urine toxicology were measured in 66 cases. The mean blood ethanol was 186.1mg/dl (SD 56.2mg/dl); 21.2% were slightly intoxicated, 75.8% moderate and 3% severe. Cannabis was detected in seven cases and amphetamines in three. Three patients needed hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS The profile of the patient who arrives to emergency department with acute ethanol intoxication is a teenager who is seen on holiday nights, after a consumption of high proof alcoholic drinks, presents a moderate intoxication, and does not require hospitalisation.</dc:description>
