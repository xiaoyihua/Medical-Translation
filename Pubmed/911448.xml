<dc:description xml:lang="en">The results of secondary nasal tip elongation in bilateral cleft lip were analyzed. Brown and Mc Dowell's, Cronin and Millard's techniques, were used in thirty-five patients, who were seen at the Cleft Lip and Palate Clinic at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico for a five year period (1970-1975). Such correction was performed in 16 patients following Brown and Mc Dowell's technique, 10 by Millard, 8 by Cronin's and just one by Abbe Stlander's technique. 60% of the patients were males and 40% were females. The follow-up control (5 years) was made in 30 patients; the results are shown.</dc:description>
