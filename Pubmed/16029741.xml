<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse pharmacist intervention (PI) resulting from the implementation of the Dáder Pharmacotherapeutic Follow-Up Program (PFU). DESIGN Descriptive study of the findings from the PFU program during the first year. SETTING Community pharmacists in area of the College of Pharmacists of the Province of Cordoba (Argentina). PARTICIPANTS A total of 202 patients were included in the PFU, selected on the basis of the observed needs by each of the participating pharmacists. PRINCIPAL MEASUREMENTS From the resulting PI reports the sex and age were obtained and problems related to medication (PRM) were classified according to the Second Consensus of Granada. The method of resolving PRM, the number of medications used and the number of visits made to the pharmacy to resolve each of them. RESULTS 38 pharmacists participated and 108 patients were registered in the PI. The number of PI increased to 280, with 218 PRM resolved (77.9% effectiveness: 95% confidence interval [CI], 70.6-86.2). 25% of the PRM were resoled between the pharmacist and the patient and 75% required the participation of the doctor, the PI achieving an acceptance of 74.6% (95% CI, 67.8-82.6). CONCLUSIONS A high percentage of resolving PRM was obtained, with a significant acceptance of the PI by the doctors, which demonstrates the feasibility of including community pharmacists in the medical team and the possibility that they could make a significant contribution in decreasing the mobility and mortality associated with medications by carrying out PFU activities.</dc:description>
