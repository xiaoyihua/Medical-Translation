<dc:description xml:lang="en">A 33-year-old secundipara with a history of gestational diabetes and familial hypertriglyceridemia exacerbated during her previous pregnancy was admitted in the 36th week of gestation with diffuse abdominal pain, vomiting, low-grade fever, and general malaise. A blood sample had a lipemic, milky-pink appearance and plasma concentrations were as follows: triglycerides 2173 mg/dL, cholesterol 320 mg/dL, amylase 801 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 650 U/L, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, glucose 380 mg/dL, and left-shifted white cells. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed and owing to signs of fetal distress, a cesarean was performed under light general anesthesia with propofol, succinylcholine, and sevoflurane. After the umbilical cord was cut, rocoronium and fentanyl were administered. The neonate was healthy and the patient's condition evolved favorably with conservative treatment. The incidence of pancreatitis during pregnancy is low but related morbidity and mortality are high. The usual cause is biliary tract disease, although rare metabolic alterations such as hyperlipidemia may occasionally act as the trigger. Early diagnosis and treatment are the keys to successful surgery and postoperative recovery.</dc:description>
