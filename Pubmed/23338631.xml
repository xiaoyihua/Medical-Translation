<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Determine the genetic diversity of Peruvian isolations of Leptospira spp. through Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). MATERIALS AND METHODS The PFGE methodology proposed by Galloway and Levett (2008) was standardized. A database including the PFGE profiles of 65 reference strains was prepared, and the technique was applied in 111 isolates of Leptospira spp. obtained in Peru between 2002 and 2010. RESULTS A great generic diversity of serovars of circulating Leptospira spp. was determined in our country. 57 serovars were identified, 47 out of 97 pathogen isolates. Most frequent serovars were Icterohaemorrhagiae/Copenhageni (n=24) and Canicola (n=7). The most frequent species were L. santarosai (49,5%) and L. interrogans (37,1%). The distribution of species, clusters and serovars changed according to the source of isolate, the environmental context and the origin. CONCLUSIONS There is great diversity of circulating serovars in Peru. There are genetic and epidemiological relations among isolates of different sources, and this is related to species, reservoir, environmental context and the origin of the isolate.</dc:description>
