They were observed during a two years period, with a follow-up time till 18 months. In report to their ages 67% were lower than 6 years old and two of them lower than one year old. There was a male sex predominance. The 'hump' sign was the most frequently observed. The most frequent damage localization was at dorsal level. All patients received treatment with four drugs, 14 of them needed orthopedic methods, and only 6 were submitted to surgical correction. In more than 50% of the patients there was good outcome toward cure or improvement with sequelae.</dc:description>
