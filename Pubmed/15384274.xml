<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Bladder cancer is such an important health problem and accounts for most of the surgical duty in the urology departments. We achieve to draw the features of patients diagnosed with bladder tumors in the Cuenca area throughout a seventeen-year period. MATERIAL AND METHOD From January 1985 to December 2002 we recorded in the Cuenca area the entire urologic tumor recently diagnosed. The following features were recorded: gender, age, pathology, TNM classification, risk factors (alcohol, cigarette smoking and coffee), social demography (rural/ urban) and the presence of metastasis. RESULTS We achieve significant differences within pathology, age at diagnosis, incidence, social demography and some risk factors throughout the seventeen-year period. CONCLUSIONS More bladder cancers are diagnosed along this time, more of them are infiltrating, in an aging population and from a rural precedence although a slightly decrease in the overall population in this are has been documented.</dc:description>
