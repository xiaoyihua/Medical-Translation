<dc:description xml:lang="en">Extrusion is used to produce crunchy expanded foods, such as snacks. The nutritional impact of this process has not been studied sufficiently. In this study, in vitro and in vivo protein and starch bioavailability was evaluated in both raw and extruded corn (Zea mays)(C) and lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus)(B) flour blends, prepared in 75C/25B and 50C/ 50B (p/p) proportions. These were processed with a Brabender extruder at 160 degrees C, 100 rpm and 15.5% moisture content. Proximate composition showed that in the extruded products protein and ash contents increased whereas the fat level decreased. In vitro protein digestibility was higher in the extrudates (82%) than in the raw flours (77%). Potentially available starch and resistant starch contents decreased with extrusion. The in vitro assays indicated that extrusion improved protein and starch availability in the studied blends. In vivo bioavailability was evaluated using the rice weevil (Sithophilus oryzae) as a biological model. The most descriptive biomarkers of the changes suggested by the in vivo tests were body protein content (increased by extrusion) and intestinal a-amylase activity (decreased by processing). Overall, results suggest that extrusion notably increases the nutritional quality of corn and lima bean flour blends.</dc:description>
