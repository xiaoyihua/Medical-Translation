<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The purpose is to describe the relationship between family disfunction and mental disorder. The secondary objective is to know the prevalence and distribution of mental disorders in primary care attended population. DESIGN A cross-sectional study was conducted in a primary care setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS Random sample was selected over 280 subjects from consultant population. The variables (family function, family structure, social and economic conditions and mental disorders) were collected through interview. APGAR test and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview test were performed. RESULTS 264 patients were finally included (64% women). Mean age was 45.6 years (SD 16.7). Mental disorders were detected in 87 patients (33%). The most prevalent disorders were generalized anxiety disorder, dysthymia and major depression, family disfunction was found in 32 patients (12.3%). Prevalence of mental disorders wasn't statistically different in the group with family disfunction. CONCLUSION Mental disorders are a common problem between primary care attended population. There wasn't any association between family disfunction and mental disorders, because of the limitations in the APGAR test in detecting family disfunction.</dc:description>
