<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED There are not published incruent methods of provocation and/or measurement of the velocity of the reflexive arterial pulse wave. This phenomenon is implicated in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension. We describe that during compressive sphygmomanometry (CS) done in the forearm, reflexive waves are provoked that are register in the arm with an equipment developed by us, which measures the velocity of the antegrade (APWV) and the provoked retrograde (RPWV) pulse waves. The procedure consist in: 1) detection, capture and digitalization by pneumatic cuffs of oscillopulses of the arm and the forearm, 2) detection of finger photopulse to control the efficacy of CS, 3) measurement of APWV and RPWV by taking the conduction time travel distance of pulse wave between detectors arm-forearm and forearm-arm respectively. Thirty normal case (group A, GA) and 37 essential systemic hypertensive patients (group B, GB) were studied. Sixteen cases of GB had left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). RESULTS A reflexive wave was provoked in 99% of cases. The APWV (m/s) was 6.0 +/- 0.9 vs 7.5 +/- 1.3, p &lt; 0.001 for GA and GB respectively. The RPWV (m/s) of the same groups were 1.8 +/- 0.3 vs 2.5 +/- 0.7, p &lt; 0.001. The hypertensive cases with LVH had more RPWV than the cases without it (2.7 +/- 0.6 vs 2.3 +/- 0.6, p = 0.07). CONCLUSION Hypertensive cases vs normals had higher antegrade and retrograde pulse wave velocities possible due to the major degree of arterial rigidity of the former. The method may be used in study of chronic arteriopathy.</dc:description>
