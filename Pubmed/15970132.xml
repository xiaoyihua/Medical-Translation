Little is known about Internet patient's use in Spain. Our objective was to study the frequency with which patients with different chronic autoimmune diseases cared in our unit use Internet as a source of medical information, and to identify the factors associated with its use. METHODS A survey was carried out on Internet use to patients cared in a teaching hospital Systemic Autoimmune Diseases unit along three consecutive weeks. RESULTS Hundred thirty-eight patients completed the questionnaire. Eighty-seven (63%) were women. Fifty-four patients (39.1%) were older than 55 years. Mean disease progression was 34.2 +/- 39.2 months. 22% of the respondents were uneducated, 39% had elementary education level; 20% had average education level, and 20% had advanced education level. Forty-two patients (30.4%) used regularly Internet for any purpose. Factors associated to Internet use for medical purposes were regular Internet use (OR: 4.6; CI: 1.1-18.8;p = 0.03), and average or advanced educational degree (advanced education: OR: 22.9; CI: 2.6-202.7; p = 0.005; average education: OR: 8.5; CI: 1.2-59.6; p = 0.03). Eighty-one patients (58.7%) expressed their need of information on quality web pages. CONCLUSIONS Many patients use Internet for medical purposes in our environment and even more consider to use it in the future.
