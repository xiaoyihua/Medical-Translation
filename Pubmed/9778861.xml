<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Fasciolosis is a source of serious economic loss in various regions of Brazil and when control measures of its host (molluscs) are not taken under favorable ecological conditions, isolated cases of human Fasciolosis may occur. Among the alternative measures for its control is the use of vegetable extracts and the purpose of this project is the assessment of the use of juice extracted from the fruit and seeds of the Paraiso plant (Melia azedarach L.) in the control of Lymnaea cubensis, the main vector of Fasciolosis in Cuba. MATERIAL AND METHOD Various concentrations of the juice extracted from the Paraiso fruit (Melia azedarach L.) were tested to determine the average and maximum lethal doses (DL50 and DL90' respectively) used in a computerized PROBIT-LOG program. Seven experimental series were undertaken, 72 molluscs being used in each of them. Three groups of ten molluscs were tested to determine the effect on cardiac frequency, two of them being treated with CL50 = 0.88627 and CL90 = 1.7641, respectively, the third being used as control. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS A considerable effect of both doses on the cardiac frequency of the mollusc studied was observed. The results were encouraging, for they demonstrated the potential use of this plant in the control of undesirable molluscs.</dc:description>
