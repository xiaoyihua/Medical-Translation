<dc:description xml:lang="en">Feeding during the first months of life has a decisive influence not only in early developmental phases of children but also in their long-term health. Therefore, inclusion of new functional ingredients to pediatric milk formulas is, nowadays, the matter of a number of studies, incorporating day-by-day newer products and more similar to human milk, the gold standard, which contains them in a natural way. Nowadays, technological advances have made possible to obtain these ingredients from animal or vegetal sources for their addition into pediatric milk formulas and cereals. In the present article, the main functional ingredients, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, palmitate, nucleotides, pre- and probiotic oligosaccharides, carnitine and taurine are reviewed with regards to their nutritional and functional interest in infant feeding. Their incorporation in pediatric foods has been possible after carrying out animal and clinical studies that provide a solid scientific basis which guaranties their proper bioavailability and their efficacy in the newborn. In the future years, thanks to a better understanding of maternal milk composition and to the performance of further studies, it will be possible to add new ingredients that will allow to obtain pediatric milk formulas more and more similar to maternal milk from a nutritional and functional point of view.</dc:description>
