<dc:description xml:lang="en">Asthma is a global public health problem. Even though the prevalence is variable in different parts of the world, including Latin America, asthma morbility is high, particularly in countries with emerging economies. Asthma mortality is unacceptable, especially since it has been estimated that a high percentage of asthma deaths could be prevented. Fortunately, most patients suffer mild persistent asthma, however, there is evidence that asthma is many times underdiagnosed and undertreated. Primary care physicians, family doctors and paediatricians have to deal with the majority of asthma patients together with different medical conditions; such as heart problems, diabetes, and infectious, etcetera. In order to help these physicians in the process of decision making, guidelines have been developed. There are many asthma guidelines; they range from opinion based guidelines (in the past) to a current more evidence based approach. Among GINA, Global Initiative for Asthma, is the most comprehensive and widespread all around the world. More than a guideline, GINA is actually a programme directed at asthma specialists, other health care providers and patients and their families.</dc:description>
