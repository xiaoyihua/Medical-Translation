<dc:description xml:lang="en">Amazing advances have been made in medical sciences since the first international conference on eating disorders (ED) was held in the 1970s, and there have been remarkable changes in the field of ED itself. Back then, virtually all that was talked about was anorexia nervosa; clinicians and researchers were mainly concerned about the possible hypothalamic and endocrine factors that seemed to be involved and there had been no epidemiological studies or controlled trials with psychiatric drugs or psychotherapy. Although the picture today is quite different, there are still significant gaps which even affect the classification of these disorders, as well as their neurobiological bases and both the pharmacological and psychological treatments which should be used. This paper gives a brief summary of these gaps and discusses the need to find endophenotypes which may help in categorising and directing research into these disorders. Mention is made of possible contributions from other fields for the benefit of greater progress in understanding eating disorders. Specific reference is made to the addictive model, out of which neuropsychology and animal models may provide data transferable to our area of expertise. Lastly, the current state of ED treatment is discussed with pointers as to from what perspective it would be most useful to seek improvements.</dc:description>
