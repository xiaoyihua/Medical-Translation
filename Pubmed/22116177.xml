<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since the forties, the National Health System has been organized based on a segmented and shortly linked model by the different service providers. This segmentation is because the population has always been the criterion that differentiates the provision among institutions. Additionally, these institutions have followed strategies conditioned by their own development and in accordance with the needs of population segments that they care (vertical system: each institution is responsible for stewardship, financing and service delivery). According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the fragmentation of the National Health System (NHS) in various organizations that vertically integrate the functions of financing, security and provision, generates inefficiencies and inequities that affect the Federal government's efforts to achieve universal coverage, and impacting on its financial viability. One of the first challenges facing the NHS is associated with the financing; therefore, this paper aims to develop a proposal for structural change in the way of financing the system and changes in management and delivery of health services Mexico.</dc:description>
