<dc:title xml:lang="en">Causes and diagnosis of dysphagia</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dysphagia is a highly prevalent symptom that may be due to several pathological conditions both structural and functional and be localized at the oropharynx or the oesophagus.Oropharyngeal dysphagia may cause hyponutrition in up to 1/3 of the patients suffering from it as a result of impairment in bolus transportation efficiency and lead to impairments in safe swallowing (penetrations and aspirations)in up to 2/3 of the patients presenting it, with high risk of aspiration pneumonias and respiratory infections.In neurological, elder or institutionalised patients its prevalence may vary 30%-60%, with varying degrees of severity that may render necessary the implementation of artificial nutrition. It is also related with higher degrees of disability, longer hospital stays, and higher mortality, soit seems necessary to carry out an analysis of the current methods to perform an early and accurate diagnosis allowing for the implementation of effective therapies helping the clinician preventing complications, both nutritional and respiratory.In the present review, we outline the study of oropharynge aldysphagia from early studies of detection by means of practical and accurate methods to its confirmation by instrumental examinations, helping us not only to diagnose dysphagia but also to determine the most effective therapeutic strategies in each case (nutritional and for rehabilitation) and to control its course (AU)</dc:description>
