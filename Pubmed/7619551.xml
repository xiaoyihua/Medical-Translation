<dc:description xml:lang="en">We have studied 60 ears initial stage professional acoustic trauma and a hearing loss in the 2,000 and 4,000 frequencies at 30-40 db. We also included in the study 60 normal ears as the control group. In the first group we investigated the recruitment by the SISI test. Watson and Tolan's test, vocal audiometry and Metz's test. Recruitment was considered positive when indicated so by two of four tests. In waves I and V of BERA we have obtained the following results compared to those of the normal ears: Amplitude is similar in both waves, whatever the intensity of the click. Latencies increase with weak clicks, more in wave V, while the become equal with stronger clicks, what means the existence of recruitment. While other tests are not useful or doubtful, BERA are of interest for the study on recruitment in deep hearing loss.</dc:description>
