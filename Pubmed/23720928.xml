<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Many women experience menorrhagia episodes resistant to medical treatment requiring definitive surgical treatment. OBJECTIVE To analyze the effectiveness of hysteroscopic endometrial resection versus Novasure system. MATERIAL AND METHODS A descriptive and retrospective study comparing 20 patients who underwent endometrial ablation with Novasure vs 20 patients who underwent hysteroscopic endometrial resection. We analyzed the indication, age, time of surgery, the incidence of complications, satisfaction at 3, 6 and 12 months and technical failure. RESULTS No significant differences were found in terms of failure to complete the technique, and satisfaction at 3, 6 and 12 months. But significant differences regarding the mean operation time, which was reduced to 15 minutes among Novasure system patients. This could influence the total costs of the procedure. CONCLUSION There were no significant differences between the two methods in terms of efficacy and safety; however, the final costs seem to be higher for the Novasure system.</dc:description>
