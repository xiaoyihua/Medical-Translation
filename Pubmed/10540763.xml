<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyze the incidence and nature of the prostatic inflammatory changes, to determine the prevalence of prostatic colonization or infection in patients undergoing surgery for benign hyperplasia of the prostate (BPH) and to correlate the inflammatory lesions with the bacteriological findings. METHODS A prospective study was conducted on 175 patients undergoing surgery for BPH. All patients were entered into a study protocol that included quantitative bacterial cultures of the prostatic tissue and histological analyses of the surgical specimens. Data of previously defined variables were entered into a data base for subsequent analysis comprised of a descriptive and an analytical study. RESULTS 44 of the 175 patients (25.1%) had a positive bacterial culture of prostatic tissue. Histological lesions indicating prostatitis associated with BPH were found in 68 of the 175 patients (38.9%), regardless of the presence or absence of bacteria. Of these 68 patients with a histologically demonstrated inflammation of the prostate, only 19 (27.9%) had positive prostatic tissue cultures. The incidence of granulomatous prostatitis was 1.1%. CONCLUSIONS Histological lesions indicating prostatitis associated with BPH were found in 68 of the 175 patients (38.9%). The presence of bacteria was demonstrated in the prostates of a significant number of patients (25.1%) who underwent adenomectomy for BPH. No differences were found between the patients with a positive or negative bacterial culture and histological evidence of prostatitis.</dc:description>
