<dc:description xml:lang="en">In a national program to combat cervical uterine cancer (CUC) four basic elements should exist: primary prevention, early detection, diagnosis/treatment and palliative care. Of these, early detection is the most effective modality. One of the purposes of Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) is to encourage the use of research results with the assistance provided, reinforcing the importance of research for clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate the evidence available in the literature regarding effective nursing interventions for the early detection of CUC. The selection of articles was performed in the databases: Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, Lilacs and Cochrane. The sample of this review consisted of seven articles, with evidence levels 1, 2 or 3. The behavioral, cognitive and social interventions, showed positive effects in the early detection of CUC, especially the interactive cognitive interventions. It is suggested, when appropriate, to use a combination of interventions in order to obtain a more effective result.</dc:description>
