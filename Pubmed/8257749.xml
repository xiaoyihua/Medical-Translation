<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Analyze the extent to which criteria and practice of the Sanitary Personnel approximate the recommendations of the Consensus on the Control of Hypercholesterolemia in Spain, find out how extensive their dietary knowledge in and how skillful they are to interview and counsel a patient with hyperlipidemia. DESIGN Transversal study with simple aleatory sampling using a questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS AND LOCATION: 101 physicians and 95 nurses working in Primary Health Care Teams in Bizkaia, during the monthly of June 1991; deputies for periods inferior to 3 months were excluded. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS 82% of physicians (P) counselled dietetic treatment for cholesterolemic levels coinciding with those set in the Consensus and 70% demanded excessive analytical controls for hypercholesterolemic patients under treatment already normalized; 37% (P) and 12% of nurses (N) knew that the polyunsaturated/saturated fat ratio is the main dietetic factor; various errors were detected in questions relating to olive oil, unsaturated fat in fish and fibre values of legume; accurate responses between 13-54% (N) and 23-77% (P). CONCLUSIONS The "mediterranean diet" is not sufficiently known; our ability for the dietetic interview and personalized counsel needs to be improved. In the light of the above and taking into accounted the gaps and deviations existing between our practice and the Consensus and its applications, we consider a better diffusion of the cited document is necessary among Primary Health Care Teams.</dc:description>
