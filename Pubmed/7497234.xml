<dc:description xml:lang="en">The syndrome known as migraine with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis is a clinical syndrome of controversial pathogenesis characterized by typical migraine headaches occurring in a fixed period of time along with lymphocyte pleocytosis in CSF which persists during intercritical periods. We present four new cases of this syndrome diagnosed in our service and we review those cases published in the literature in which there were no personal headache antecedents, attempting in this way to separate this syndrome from other types of migraine as included in the present classification. There also exists the possibility that it might be a question of a secondary process, the pathogenesis of which may play a part in the activation of the humoral immune system, given the frequent existence of immunogenic antecedents the previous days as well as that of a humoral reaction expressed as an increase in IgG levels in CSF with normal blood electrophoresis.</dc:description>
