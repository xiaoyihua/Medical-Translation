<dc:description xml:lang="en">Samples of Lupinus luteus, var. Aurea/Weico and Lupinus albus var. Multolupa flours were analyzed. The flour proteins were extracted and fractionated by gel filtration, and the per cent pattern for both globulins and albumins was then determined. The dehulled seeds, previously analyzed for composition, were ground, defatted and consecutively extracted with distilled water (pH 5.0) and phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 8.5). The extracted protein content was measured by the Lowry simplified method. Globulins (pH 8.5 fraction) from both species were filtered through Sephadex G-100; besides, Lupinus albus globulins were filtered through Sephadex G-150, and absorbance of the collected fractions was measured at 280 nm. The dehulled seed (DS) of L. luteus and L. albus revealed a good protein content (58.2 and 41.0%, respectively). The protein extracted from L. luteus was constituted by 17% albumins and 58.4% globulins. In contrast, L. albus presented a higher albumin content (55.6%) than globulins (31.5%). The elution pattern for the Sephadex G-200 gel filtration showed for both lupine species analyzed a preponderant peak I corresponding in L. luteus to 55.0% and in L. albus to 84.1% of the total globulins content. From these results, it may be concluded that the dehulled seed protein content is 42.0% higher for the L. luteus sample than for the L. albus. The applied methodology indicated a predominant content of globulins above albumins in L. luteus, while in the case of L. albus, the albumin content was the highest.</dc:description>
