<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cefuroxime axetil (CAE), an orally absorbed product of cefuroxime, and amoxycillin/clavulanate (AAC), were evaluated for their efficacy and safety in the treatment of acute sinusitis. A total of 47 patients were enrolled in a randomized study to compare cefuroxime axetil 500 mg. b.d. for 8 days (25 patients) with amoxycillin/clavulanate 500 mg. t.d.s for 8 days (22 patients). All patients were evaluable for clinical, radiological and bacteriological response. Of 25 clinically assessable patients treated with CAE, 24 were cured, 1 improved and 1 relapsed (96% success rate). Of 22 assessable patients given AAC, 14 were cured and 8 improved (100% success rate). Two out of 25 (8%) patients treated with CAE experienced drug-related adverse events, including 4% with diarrhoea. In the AAC group, 3 out of 22 (13%) patients had a drug-related adverse event, including 13% with diarrhoea. In conclusion, CAE appears to be as safe and effective as AAC in the treatment of acute sinusitis.</dc:description>
