<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyze prospectively the results of the first endorectal ultrasonographies performed at the Coloproctology Unit of the Hospital Mutua de Terrassa in patients with rectal tumors. METHODS During the period between September 94 to June 95, 27 endorectal ultrasonographies were performed to patients with rectal tumors. The echographies were performed with a 360 degrees transducer. The ultrasound findings were compared to the histological results. RESULTS Three patients were not treated surgically, and were excluded from the analysis. In addition, three patients with perianastomotic recurrence were excluded. Of the remaining 21 patients the level of penetration in the rectal wall was correctly identified in 17 (81%). The presence of metastatic nodes was correctly assessed in 19 of the 24 patients explored (78%). CONCLUSION For the preoperative assessment of rectal tumors, endorectal ultrasonography offers a good accuracy even during the learning curve.</dc:description>
