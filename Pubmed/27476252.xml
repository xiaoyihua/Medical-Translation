<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of intramuscular oxytocin against intravenous oxytocin against intravenous traditional oxytocin infusion, in the active management of the third period of the delayed impingement labor work and controlled cord traction. METHODS Randomized controlled blinded clinical trial. In women age 14 to 40 with full term pregnancy, childbirth attended by ISSSTE's Regional Hospital "Gral. Ignacio Zaragoza", in the period from August to December 2015. RESULTS 152 deliveries were attended, from which 66 fulfill with selection criteria. Group 1 = 22 patients, group 2 = 21 patients and Group 3 = 23 patients. The total age average was 26.92 + 5.8. For blood volume, statistical differences were significant among the three groups (p = 0.000). Adverse reactions were presented in 1 .5%, without difference between the groups. (P = 0.337). The differences in hemoglobin values and final and initial hematocrit presented differences with statistical significance (p = 0.000 for both). CONCLUSIONS Nonetheless, the differences obtained in the analysis of the diverse variables among the three types of treatment, the three schemes are effective on the obstetrical hemorrhage prevention.</dc:description>
