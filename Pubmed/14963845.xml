<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The changeover to the new currency has meant that the Money test, a screening test for dementia with a number of advantages over those currently available, is now of no use. AIMS Our aim was to perform a preliminary evaluation of the Eurotest, which is a version of the Money test adapted to the new currency system. DESIGN phase I, diagnostic evaluation (convenience sampling; pre-test prevalence 50%). SUBJECTS &gt;65 years with no sensory deficit; 30 with mild dementia and 30 without dementia. METHOD evaluation of socio-demographic variables and of mini-mental performance (MMSE), Pfeiffer's test (SPMSQ), the seven-minute test (7MT) and Eurotest. Statistical study: comparison between groups using t test and chi squared, depending on the variables; determination of diagnostically useful parameters and ROC curves, with their respective 95% confidence intervals; linear regression study with a step by step strategy. RESULTS The groups did not differ as regards age, sex, level of schooling, degree of literacy, employment and knowledge of money systems. The Eurotest has a sensitivity of 0.93 (0.76-0.99) and a specificity of 0.87 (0.68-0.96), which is similar to that of the MMSE and the 7MT. The Eurotest (6.77 +/- 1.65 min) takes less time than the 7MT (8.87 +/- 1.81 min) and is not modified by the subject's clinical situation. The level of schooling does not affect the results of the Eurotest. CONCLUSIONS The Eurotest is simple, quick, valid, useful and is unaffected by the level of schooling, which are features that make it a valid alternative to the tests currently available.</dc:description>
