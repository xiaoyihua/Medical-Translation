<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Human papillomavirus (HPV) genital infection is a sexually transmitted disease that appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of various tumors of the genitourinary system, especially carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Diagnosis and treatment of sexual partners of female carriers is fundamental in preventing reinfection after treatment. METHODS A prospective study was conducted on 118 male partners of females diagnosed as having HPV infection by cytology and, in some cases, dysplasia or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. RESULTS Patient mean age was 38.5 years; 40 had a history of other sexually transmitted diseases. Peneoscopy was performed in all cases, 44 were biopsied and 47 had a urethral cytology. The infection rate was 55%. Peneoscopy and biopsy were the best diagnostic methods. CONCLUSIONS HPV infection in male partners of female carriers can be diagnosed by peneoscopy and biopsy of the suspected lesions. Treatment and complete eradication of the infection are fundamental since HPV has been implicated in the pathogenesis of carcinoma of the cervix and other urogenital tumors.</dc:description>
