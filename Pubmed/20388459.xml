<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the response to cognitive event-related potentials (P300) in patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and their relationship with clinical and cognitive status before and after shunt surgery. METHODS We performed a prospective study in a series of 26 patients with NPH who underwent clinical and cognitive assessment before surgery and 6 months afterwards. Visual P300 potentials obtained before and after treatment were also compared with those obtained in 18 healthy volunteers. RESULTS Before shunting, the P300 wave was detected in 11 (42.3%) NPH patients, compared with the 18 (100%) volunteers. Six months after shunting, the P300 wave was found in 20 (76.9%) NPH patients. P300 latency was significantly longer in NPH patients than in the control group before surgery, but not at 6 months after surgery. No significant differences in neuropsychological studies or in the level of dependence for daily life activities were found between the subgroups of NPH patients with and without pre-surgical P300 waves, or between changes in P300 parameters and clinical and cognitive changes. CONCLUSIONS The P300 wave was delayed or undetectable in a substantial percentage of patients with NPH before surgery. These alterations can be reversed by shunting. P300 analysis and neuropsychological tests could be complementary measures to evaluate functional status in patients with NPH.</dc:description>
