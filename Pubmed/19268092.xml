<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The aim of this study is to establish the risk of thromboembolic events and evaluation of the use of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients and after discharge, and their concordance with protocols used in our hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a cross-sectional with prospective follow-up until hospital discharge. It included all medical patients in Internal Medicine, Pneumology and Oncology Departments. The patient's thromboembolic risk and type of thromboembolism prophylaxis indication during hospitalization and after discharge were determined. RESULTS A total of 116 patients (52 in Internal Medicine Department, 35 in Pneumology Department and 29 in Oncology Department), with a mean age of 67 +/- 17 years (35 females; 81 males) were included. During hospitalization, 62.9% of the patients had a high risk of thromboembolic events, 3.4% a moderate risk, 23.3% low risk, and 10.3% had no risk. After discharge, these proportions were 35.6%, 3.8%, 24% and 34.6%, respectively. A total of 49.1% of the patients had an adequate indication of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis during the hospitalization and after discharge.</dc:description>
