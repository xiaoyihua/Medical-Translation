<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the present paper the incidence and severity of croup during the months of september, october and november of the last three years is analyzed. The existence of an important outbreak of laryngitis in the autumn of 1987, with a peak of incidence during the month of october is shown. A prospective study about the children with croup admitted in a pediatric center during the epidemic period in 1987. Was done after serologic and cell-virus culture tests it became clear that the parainfluenza virus type 1 was the cause of the outbreak, as excepted. We suggest the possibility of another laryngitis outbreak in 1989 if there is not change in the epidemiologic pattern of the virus.</dc:description>
