<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The beneficial effects of estrogen supplementation in climacteric women are clear. However, their psychological effects are not well documented. AIM To study the effects of estrogen supplementation on psychological variables in climacteric women. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Forty postmenopausal women were divided in two groups to receive a daily dose of 2 mg oestradiol valerate and 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate or an identical placebo during six months. Initially and at the end of the treatment period, they were subjected to a psychiatric interview and the Graffar, Hamilton and Eysenk personality tests were applied. Also, an Analysis of Verbal Behavior was used, that results in hope and hopeless scores. RESULTS There were no differences in the initial assessment between the two treatment groups. In women receiving hormonal supplementation, the Hamilton score decreased from 11.2 to 4.9 (p &lt; 0.002) and in women receiving placebo from 8.1 to 5.3 (NS). No other significant changes in psychological tests were observed. CONCLUSIONS Hormonal supplementation decreases the Hamilton depression score in postmenopausal women.</dc:description>
