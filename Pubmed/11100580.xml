<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyze the degree of utilization of generic drugs in Spain and Catalonia. To determine real savings and scope for further savings due to the use of generic drugs. DESIGN Descriptive, crossover study. SETTING Public health prescription in Spain and Catalonia in June of 1999 and in Catalonia from January to June of 1999. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS In June of 1999, the market share of generic drugs in Spain was 1.15% in units and 0.91% in pesetas of the hole drug prescription. The most used were oral ranitidine, oral diclofenac and oral amoxicillin. Catalonia, in this period, has a greater relative utilization of generic drugs, specially in psychotherapeutic agents like alprazolam and fluoxetine. During the first semester of 1999 only in 9.9% of the occasions where generic drugs could be used, were they actually prescribed. Specifically, the drug most used in its generic form was oral diclofenac with 27.1% of the all possible prescriptions. The real savings generated by the generic drugs were 0.2% of the public pharmaceutical bill, and the theoretical capacity of savings with the current generic offer were 2.3%. CONCLUSIONS There is a low but fast-rising utilization of generic drugs in Spain and Catalonia. Nevertheless the possibilities of savings are at the moment, in relative terms, small. A greater use of them and specially a diversification of the offer is necessary to achieve important relative savings in the overall pharmaceutical bill.</dc:description>
