<dc:description xml:lang="en">Abdominal ultrasonographic study is a part of the acute abdominal pain diagnosis protocol in our hospital. As an internal quality assessment, we performed a six-month prospective study, including those patients who meet one of these requirements: 1st the reason for attendance being non-traumatic abdominal pain 2nd an abdominal ultrasonography achieved at the hospital. Collected data included: demographic characteristics, presenting sign and symptoms, test results, ultrasonography, final diagnosis and treatment. Children attended to the hospital were evaluated through clinical findings to verify concordance between clinical and ultrasound diagnosis, and patients who did not stay at the hospital had telephone follow-up in 2 weeks. A total of 136 patients underwent ultrasonography (7 children did not cooperate and were discarded): 74 females and 55 males with a mean age of 9.52 years. Admission was required in 63 subjects and 66 were sent home after clinical evaluation. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed by the radiologist on duty (occasionally paediatric radiologist). Ultrasound examination, for acute appendicitis, had a sensitivity of 94.8%, specificity of 98.8%, positive predictive value of 97.3% and negative predictive value of 97.8%. Abdominal ultrasonography has showed usefulness for surgical pathology discrimination in acute abdominal pain. When ultrasonography is inconclusive, clinical follow-up and periodical ultrasonography results in a positive change in management and treatment.</dc:description>
