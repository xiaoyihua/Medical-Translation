<dc:description xml:lang="en">During this experimental work, we studied the immunological recuperation in CD1 mice in whom a weakening disease was induced using intraperitoneal injections of a sterile mixture of dead staphylococci. After a deep depression of the synthesis of anti-sheep red blood cell antibodies (SRBC) during the following 10 days after the induction of wasting, the animals regained their capability to produce anti-SRBC antibodies, significantly increasing. Two weeks after the injections were applied, the average number of antibody producing cells rose significantly and even doubled in the control group of healthy mice. Finally, after two weeks after this "rebound", the number of antibody forming cells return to normality. The article includes a discussion on the biological significance of this carried out in experimental animals while offering a hope for children with secondary immunological deficiencies or for those with repeatedly severe infections.</dc:description>
