<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Violence against women is a recognized public health problem in developed countries. There is increasing awareness on family violence in Chile, but there is scant information about its prevalence. AIM To determine the prevalence of family violence against women in a population sample in Temuco, Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS A standardized questionnaire about family violence was applied to a sample of 422 women at their homes. The questionnaire had six sections that included a list of violent behaviors from husbands or partners, a standardized instrument to assess mental health and alcohol consumption by the couple, history of child abuse, community support, type of employment and years of school education. RESULTS Forty nine percent of women reported psychological aggression, 13% reported physical violence and 5.5%, sexual violence. The presence of anxiety or depressive symptoms, being witness of violence between parents during childhood, a lower educational level, being a housewife, alcohol abuse and lack of community support were risk factors for violence among women. Among men, the history of child abuse, a lower education level, and alcohol abuse were identified as risk factors for violent behaviors. CONCLUSIONS Conjugal violence is a significant mental health problem in Temuco, Chile.</dc:description>
