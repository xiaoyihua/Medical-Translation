<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors report a case of entomophthoromicosis caused by Conidiobolus coronatus, a saprophytic fungus that belongs to the class Zygomycetes (Phycomycetes in the past). Our patient was from a rural area. The paranasal sinuses had been drained surgically and a polyp was removed from his nasal cavity. He had a deformity in the face and nasal obstruction. His general condition and immunological status were normal except for epistaxis since childhood. The diagnosis was made clinically by the appearance of the lesion and confirmed by the mycological and histopathological findings. The therapeutic response was slow but with total resolution of the lesion.</dc:description>
