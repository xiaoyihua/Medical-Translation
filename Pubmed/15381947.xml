<dc:description xml:lang="en">Liver cirrhosis main related to hepatitis C virus constitutes the main indication of liver transplantation in Europe and the USA, representing as many as 50% of the indications in adults, while cirrhosis associated with hepatitis B virus represents around 10%. The indications for transplantation in patients with infection by both viruses are fulminant hepatitis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Both injections may relapse after transplantation. The evolution of the relapse in the graft is variable and can include non-significant alterations of the liver junction tests, chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis. Less frequently, a particularly severe form called "fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis" can develop, which rapidly evolve to graft failure. The immunoglobin against the B virus and lamivudine reduce the risk of reinfection. The principal factor associated with reinfection is active viral replication before the transplantation, thus it is considered a contraindication for liver transplantation. INF-alpha has been used in the treatment of hepatitis B virus reinfection with discouraging results. More recently, lamivudine and adefovir have been used. Post-transplantation recurrence of hepatitis C is universal and its evolution towards cirrhosis is more rapid than in immunocompetent patients, with graft dysfunction being the most frequent cause of mortality and of indication for retransplantation. Different factors have been related to the severity of the recurrence including factors related to the donor, the recipient, the virus, immunosuppression and surgery. There are no preventive treatments against recurrence of post-transplantation hepatitis C. In the treatment of the hepatitis C virus recurrence, INF-alpha and rivabirin have been used in single form or in combination with variable results, with the combined therapy being more effective. Recently, encouraging results have been described with the combination of pegylated interferon and rivabirin without a higher incidence of rejection. Finally, the results of retransplantation in patients with recurrent hepatitis B or C have not been encouraging.</dc:description>
