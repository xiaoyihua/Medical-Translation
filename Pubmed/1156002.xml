<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two cases of aortic pseudocoarctation were presented, the first one associated to rheumatic heart disease and the other one with an added obstruction of the left subclavian artery due to an angulation. The alterations of the subclavian arteries due to obstruction have been described very few occasions because they are usually asymptomatic. In our case there was only tiredness of the affected limb. The association of pseudocoarctation with rheumatic heart disease has been never reported, but we consider it to be just a mere coincidence. After reviewing what has been reported, we conclude that since the aortic pseudocoarctation is a benign sickness, the only thing to be done is to check these patients periodically.</dc:description>
