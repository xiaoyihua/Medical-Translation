<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Previous studies have related the delay in starting chemotherapy (&gt;3 months from date of surgery) with worse survival. The study objective is to analyse the delay in the start of chemotherapy and associated biomedical, sociodemographic and cultural factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS A cohort of women operated on for breast cancer, candidates for receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and participants in a clinical trial of non-pharmacological intervention, were surveyed regarding the delay in starting their chemotherapy, measured by the number of days from date of surgery. Differences in function of the clinical and biographical variables were studied. RESULTS In 197 women, mean delay was 42.32 (15.29) days; this was associated with tumour stage (i, 40.06 days; ii, 44.76 days; iii, 38.7 days; P=.049), age (≤ 35, 37.36 days; 36-64, 41.49 days; ≥ 65, 52.61 days; P=.007) and occupational situation (active, 36.91 days; unemployed, 45.5 days; pensioner, 40.07 days; housewife, 43.17 days; P=.038). For patients older than 65 years, the delay in starting adjuvant chemotherapy was longer than for those in the 2 lower age groups -less than 35 years, and between 35 and 65 years- (P=.023 and P=.009 respectively). In the multivariate analysis, the variables associated independently with the delay in starting chemotherapy were again age (P=.019), tumour stage (P=.037) and occupational situation (P=.022). CONCLUSION Patients began receiving adjuvant chemotherapy within the time period (3 months from surgery) defined as appropriate, and during which no evidence exists of worse survival results. Length of delay varied according to age, tumour stage and occupational situation.</dc:description>
