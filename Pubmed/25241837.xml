<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report two cases of right crossed non-fused renal ectopia diagnosed in male patients about 30 years of age who arrived to emergency centres with symptoms of renal colic. METHODS We report two cases of male patients who arrived to an emergency centre complaining of colic lumbar pain. Crossed renal ectopia was finally revealed by means of intravenous urogram after several analytical and imaging examinations. RESULTS/CONCLUSION Right crossed non-fused renal ectopia is an uncommon congenital anomaly with a higher incidence in males. It is much more common to find a crossed fused renal ectopia of the orthotopic kidney. In contrast, if there is no fusion it may be located on the lower portion of the normal kidney, which is not the case in this instance. This malformation is not usually accompanied by other congenital anomalies. Most of cases are spontaneously solved and they do not require an intercurrent surgical intervention.</dc:description>
