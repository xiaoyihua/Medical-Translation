<dc:description xml:lang="en">From January, 1988 to March, 1994, 83 patients with diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease, were identified. Incidence was 2.4 per 1000 births. Average age of patients was 28.9 years. Forty four point five per cent of them were multiparae and in 25.3% there was the antecedent of molar pregnancy. Seventy seven point one per cent of the cases are from low socioeconomic stratum. The diagnosis was done by ultrasound in 89.1%. Instrumental uterine curettage was done in 89.1%, with histological confirmation in 100% of the cases. From the 83 cases with molar pregnancy, 74 were classified as complete moles, four, incomplete, four, invasive and one choriocarcinoma. There was follow up in all the patients with beta fraction of chorionic gonadotropin hormone; this was negative in most of the cases for eight weeks after evacuation. Oral contraceptives were indicated in 73.4% of the cases.</dc:description>
