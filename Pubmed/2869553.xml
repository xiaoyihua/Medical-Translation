<dc:description xml:lang="en">The effect of a type A MAO inhibitor, clorgyline, injected alone or with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (aMpT) on the plasmatic corticosterone levels estimated at 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. has been studied in male Wistar rats. The clorgyline injected alone produced significant decreases in corticosterone values, especially at 5 p.m., determining a variation lack between the morning and the afternoon levels. When alpha-MpT is associated to IMAO, increases at both points of the day considered in this experiment take place. The amount of NA and 5-HT in the brain was also estimated; clorgyline high increases in Na and 5-HT contents, 5-HT; aMpT reduces the effect of clorgyline, especially as regards content. The results are discussed in relation to this highly specific MAO inhibitor and with the role of these amines as modulators of ACTH secretion. In view of the changes introduced by the aMpT injection, the modifications produced by clorgyline alone are related to NA, but to 5-HT, when the NA synthesis has been interrupted by the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor.</dc:description>
