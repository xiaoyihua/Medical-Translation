<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Overall and central obesity are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. AIM To investigate the association of body weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) with cardiovascular risk factors in Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS We included 5,157 participants from the National Health Survey 2009-2010. Prevalence of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia (high total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and low HDL-cholesterol) were defined using international recommendations. BMI and WC were measured using standardized protocols. RESULTS A five percent lower body weight, BMI and WC were associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk factors. For each 5% reduction in body weight, the risk for hypertension decreased by 8 and 9% in women and men respectively. Similar risk reductions were observed for diabetes (9 and 11% respectively), metabolic syndrome (23 and 30% respectively), low HDL cholesterol (13 and 13% respectively), high triglyceride levels (16 and 18% respectively) and total cholesterol (8 and 10% respectively). Similar findings were observed for BMI and WC. CONCLUSIONS Lower body weight, BMI or WC are associated with important reductions in cardiovascular risk factors. A 5% reduction in these adiposity markers could be a perfectly feasible goal for lifestyle interventions.</dc:description>
