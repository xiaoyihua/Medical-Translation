<dc:description xml:lang="en">RATIONALE To study sociodemographic characteristics and current diagnostic and therapeutic behaviour with Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) patients in Spain at the end of the 20th century. METHODS Sociodemographic, clinical, therapeutic and quality of life (QoL) data from study ESECI-98, conducted in Spain (1998-1999) in patients with BPH. RESULTS Nine hundred and forty nine patients were evaluable, with a mean (+/- SD) age of 65.6 (+/- 7.8) years, with concomitant diseases (40%), pain/discomfort (34%) and anxiety/depression (23%); QoL score (mean +/- SD) was 72.1 +/- 16.1 on a total possible score of 100. BPH diagnosis was based on symptoms (93%), digital rectal examination (93%) and abdomino-pelvic ultrasonography (76%). PSA was mentioned for the diagnosis of BPH in 54% of the patients and 77% were receiving pharmacological treatment (61% alpha-blockers) during less than 6 months (38%) or more than a year (35%). CONCLUSIONS In this study the diagnosis of BPH was mainly based on symptoms, digital rectal examination and abdomino-pelvic ultrasonography. It is worth mentioning that PSA for the diagnosis of BPH, was used in a half of the total number of patients. Pharmacological therapy was used in 3 out of every 4 patients. Compared to a previous national study, there is a change on diagnosis and therapy of BPH.</dc:description>
