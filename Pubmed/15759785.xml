<dc:description xml:lang="en">Self-expandable prostheses have gained in popularity for palliation tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. We present four cases of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who were palliated by self-expandable metallic prostheses. Two patients had undergone total gastrectomy with esophago-jejunal anastomosis. In one there was recurrent cancer in the anastomosis and the other had non-malignant stenosis. The remaining two patients had unresectable tumors. Correct placement of prostheses was possible in all cases; however, maintenance of adequate hydration and acceptable nutritional status per orem was possible only in three of four patients. In all cases there was temporary slight pain, in one, slight hemorrhage, and in one the prosthesis migrated and it was necessary to withdraw it surgically. Although these are only a few cases, we can say that self-expandable prostheses are a promising alternative to palliate gastric cancer.</dc:description>
