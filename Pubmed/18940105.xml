<dc:description xml:lang="en">This research follows the line of investigation opened some years ago about the generalizability studies and variance components applied to soccer. In this investigation, various matches played during the final phase of the last three World Championships (France'98, Korea and Japan'02 and Germany'06) were observed and coded while their interaction contexts were registered. In total, 58 matches were used for this investigation. The following facets were considered: 5 field areas where the 48 contexts are moved or transformed and 7 different types of match result. The results confirm the linear model, which can be generalized to the universe. The resulting 1% of the variance explained by the World Championship facet (1 point when analyzed singly and 14 points when it interacts with the other facets) allows us to confirm that soccer has not changed over the last three World Championships.</dc:description>
