<dc:description xml:lang="en">Obesity and overweight are serious public health problems. Many observational studies suggest that low level of education would be among the many factors involved in its development. Our objective was to determine whether there was a relationship between lower education levels and increased body mass index (BMI). In this cross-sectional study, the BMI of adult outpatients evaluated at Internal Medicine Service of a General Hospital in Buenos Aires City was measured and a survey was given to determine their level of education and the prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors. Between June 24th, 2013 and September 5th, 2013, 513 patients were included, 196 (38%) had overweight and 169 (33%) were obese. The mean age of patients with high BMI was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.0001) compared to those who have normal BMI, and a statistically significant association between overweight and obesity with over 30 years of age was observed (p &lt; 0.0001). Low education level was independently associated with the presence of obesity, only in subjects younger than 30 years (OR 3.18 IC 95% 1.10-9.23, p = 0.033). These results suggest that lower level of formal instruction behaves as an independent risk factor for the development of obesity in young individuals. This finding indicates that formal education also might be a useful intervention to maintain a healthy weight.</dc:description>
