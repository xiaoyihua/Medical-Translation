<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thirty atopic pregnant women by clinical history, skin testing, and laboratory data, and 10 non-atopic women, were studied for the influence of a diet on the outcome of their babies. The atopic women were divided into two groups: non-diet and diet group, the last group, decided to follow a non-allergenic diet that they started after 11 weeks of pregnancy. We had a follow up of the babies from all pregnancies after birth for a year. As a part of the babies clinical history, we determined the IgE concentration within 2 months after birth. Our data indicated that two babies from diet group and non from the control group, had an atopic disease during the first year of life, in contrast, five babies from the non-diet group, these preliminary results, suggested that a non-allergenic diet in atopic pregnant women, may decrease the morbidity of atopic disease during the first year of life.</dc:description>
