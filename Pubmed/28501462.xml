<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM Evaluation of clinical and functional outcome of ray resection in paediatric population and description of key aspects of surgical technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a retrospective review of all patients undergoing surgery between 2010-2015. INCLUSION CRITERIA one or more ray resections of the hand and a minimum of one year follow-up. Evaluation of clinical characteristics, functional and cosmetic results, complications, need for psychological support and patient or family satisfaction. RESULTS Four patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age at surgery was 5 years (range, 1-14 years). Aetiology was: fibrolipomatous hamartoma, traumatic amputation, radial deficiency and complex syndactyly. Second ray was resected in three patients and third and fourth ray in one. No finger transfer was performed. No immediate post-operative complications were found at the final evaluation. None of them needed psychological support. All the patients showed excellent clinical and functional results with a high grade of satisfaction. DISCUSSION Ray resection of the hand has been used as salvage procedure in patients with vascular lesions, tumours, trauma, infections or congenital malformations. There are only a few published studies including small samples in adults or case reports, with no references in the paediatric population. CONCLUSION Ray resection of the hand is a useful and safe technique in paediatric population, obtaining excellent cosmetic and functional results in those cases in which it is impossible to preserve one or more fingers.</dc:description>
