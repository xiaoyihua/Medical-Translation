<dc:description xml:lang="en">A drug interaction is the quantitative or qualitative modification of the effect of a drug by the simultaneous or successive administration of a different one. Hypertensive patients, mainly the more elderly ones, frequently present concomitant diseases that require the administration of several medicines which facilitates the appearance of interactions. The lack of effectiveness of the antihypertensive treatment is a relatively frequent fact that sometimes is due to interactions of antihypertensive drugs with other treatments. It is difficult to determine the incidence of interactions, but it is related to the number of drugs administered simultaneously. Between 37 and 60% of hospital-admissions are treated with potentially dangerous drug associations and up to a 6% of fatal events are due to this circumstance. Among antihypertensive drugs, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are less affected by drug-interactions. Lipophilic beta-blockers agents may present some clinical relevant interactions, whereas calcium channel blockers, especially the non-dihydropiridinic ones, are implied in clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions. Among the angiotensin receptor blockers there are differences that would have to be considered when they are used in patients who receive other drugs. Although it is impossible for the doctor to remember all the clinical relevant interactions, it is important to bear in mind their existence and the possible mechanisms of production which can help to identify them and to contribute to their prevention. The most frequent interactions related with clinical problems are the pharmacokinetic ones, mainly those related to the metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system or the presystemic clearance by means of the P-glycoprotein. Enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system may present polymorphisms that can explain the individual differences in the response to drugs or the appearance of drug-interactions.</dc:description>
