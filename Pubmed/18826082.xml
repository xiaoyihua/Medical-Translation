<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Intraarticular injuries of pediatric patients have a different approach to that of adult patients. Part of this problem lies in minimizing children's symptoms by parents as well as physicians thinking they are less prone to injuries that require surgical management. Arthroscopy has helped in diagnosing these injuries, but the use of this method could be over used. We present a correlation of clinical diagnosis and arthroscopic findings. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a transversal retrolective study in "Hospital Central Sur Petroleos Mexicanos". We compared clinical diagnoses vs. arthroscopic findings in a group of patients younger than 18 years operated on from June 1995 to February 2005. RESULTS One hundred and thirty one patients were operated on, and subdivided in two groups: younger that 13 years and older that 13 years, 42% preoperative and postoperative diagnoses correlated in the first group, and 46% for the second group. CONCLUSION Arthroscopic surgery is useful in achieving better diagnostic precision, as well as it gives us the opportunity to specifically treat knee injuries in pediatric patients.</dc:description>
