<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION We assess frequency and intensity of depression in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, the degree at which it is detected and its relationship to the treatment with beta interferon and other clinical and paraclinical factors. METHODS The series comprises MS patients, seen in the Demyelinating Disease Unit of a tertiary hospital, who fulfilled the following criteria: clinically defined MS (relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive), disease duration greater than two years and absence of relapses during the month prior to the study. The variables analyzed were detection and assessment of depression with the Hamilton Depression Scale, general demographic data, functional systems, EDSS, ISS, ESS, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, interferon treatment, chronic fatigue and a series of analytical variables. Statistical study: both variate and multivariate analysis by logistic regression. RESULTS 100 patients (72 female and 28 male). Mean age: 39.27 years. RR MS form, 88%, and SPMS form, 12 %. Mean evolution time, 11.2 years. Mean EDSS, 2.54. Depression was present in 44 % of the patients in our group and was not related to neurological degree of disability, disease evolution time, clinical form, interferon treatment, or to sleep disorders. However, depression was related to the presence of both chronic fatigue and ESS scores. CONCLUSIONS Depression is common in MS patients and is associated with the presence of chronic fatigue and a worse social status.</dc:description>
