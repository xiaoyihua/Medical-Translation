<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The efficacy of clindamycin-primaquine as treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is similar to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol and endovenous pentamidine. The untoward effects of this combination are scarce and of mild degree. METHODS Patients presenting with microbiologically confirmed PCP (bronchoalveolar lavage or induced sputum) were treated with clindamycin-primaquine. Patients presenting PO2 of less than 60 mmHg were excluded, being therefore treated with conventional therapy. RESULTS Sixteen patients received treatment with clindamycin-primaquine. All demonstrated clinical improvement after the fifth day of treatment. Treatment was discontinued in three patients due to cutaneous adverse reactions. One patient voluntarily discontinued treatment, being readmitted with acute respiratory failure, and died. Clinical cure was achieved in 13 patients who completed the treatment with clindamycin-primaquine. CONCLUSIONS The combination of clindamycin-primaquine was effective as the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in the patients here reported. The percentage of patients who presented secondary effects was not greater than expected with other therapeutic options. The severity of the adverse events was mild and easy to control.</dc:description>
