<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the obstetrics outcomes of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective, analytic, and descriptive case of study is presented about of the obstetrics outcomes of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy attended in Hospital General de Mexico Obstetrics and Gynecology Service from June, 2000 to February, 2003. RESULTS Thirty-six records were reviewed. The mean age was 28 years. The most frequent maternal complications were the hypertensive disorders in association with pregnancy (27.5%). One patient had antiphospholipid syndrome, showed HELLP syndrome I and brain hemorrhage, she died in puerperium period. The main resolution of pregnancy was normal delivery. The median gestational age at delivery was 36 weeks (range of 24-40 weeks), and the mean birth weight was 2,389 g, median Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes of life respectively. There were 19 cases of low weight at birth and 7 preterm deliveries. There were no cases of neonatal lupus. CONCLUSION The maternal-fetal morbid-mortality rates decrease when no lupic disease activity is reported. During the pregnancy stage, preterm delivery and intrauterine growth retardation grow in number as observed in all the study subjects. All pregnancies should still be considered high risk and be managed with a multidisciplinary team. Co-existing antiphospholipid syndrome is the poorer prognosis for pregnancy outcome.</dc:description>
