<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Salmonella infections (SI) are common in Spain. The aim of this study was to appraise risk factors and the clinical characteristics of sporadic Salmonella Typhimurium infections compared with other sporadic salmonella serotype infections (OSI). METHODS From September 2014 to August 2015, a case-case study was carried out by the Epidemiology Division of the Public Health Centre of Castellon. Case 1 consisted of patients with sporadic S. Typhimurium infections, while case 2 comprised OSI patients, assessed according to the stool cultures analyzed by the Microbiology Laboratories of Hospital General de Castellon and Hospital de La Plana in Vila-real. Patients from detected outbreaks were not included. The salmonella serotype was identified by the National Centre of Microbiology (Madrid). RESULTS The total number of SI patients reported was 327, 242 of whom were studied (74.0%). 148 patients had sporadic S. Typhimurium infection and 64 had OSI, with median ages of 4 and 8.5 years, respectively. Sporadic S. Typhimurium infection patients presented more blood in feces and diarrhea episodes. Consumption of pork meat (OR=2.22; 95% CI 1.12-4.43), cold pork meats (OR=2.49; 95% CI 1.32-4.68) and playing in the dirt (OR=3.02; 95% CI 1.55-5.88), were associated with sporadic S. Typhimurium infection. In the 0-4 year-old group, the associated factors were consumption of cold pork meats, omelets and female gender. In the 5-year-old and over group, only playing in soil was associated with sporadic S. Typhimurium infection. CONCLUSIONS The consumption of pork and omelets, as well as playing in the dirt, were the main factors associated with infection. Children were most affected by sporadic S. Typhimurium infection.</dc:description>
