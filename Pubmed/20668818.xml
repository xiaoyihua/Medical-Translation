<dc:description xml:lang="en">Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a severe disease, specially among immunocompromised patients. Its frequency increases in other patients such as those with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), mainly when steroids are prescribed. The most common form of presentation is a respiratory tract infection with poor response to antimicrobial treatment. The delay in its diagnosis is one of the main causes of its high lethality. Once suspected, respiratory secretion cultures, chest X ray examination and computed tomography should be obtained and galactomannan, a marker of hematogenous dissemination of the microorganism, should be determined. Although the repeated isolation of Aspergillus spp is suggestive of invasive disease, the definitive diagnosis requires cytopathological confirmation. Further studies should be performed in these patients, since the available information was obtained from the observations made in immunocompromised patients, and may not be applicable accurately to API among COPD patients.</dc:description>
