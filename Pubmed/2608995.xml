<dc:description xml:lang="en">A case of Kartagener's syndrome (situs inversus, sinusitis and bronchiectasis) is reported at the "Comandante Manuel Fajardo" Teaching Clinico-surgical Hospital, Havana City, in a patient aged 33 years, who presents the three elements of Kartagener's triad. The case was investigated in the Department of Medicine and Department of Radiology. The literature on this uncommon syndrome was reviewed and it was found that there are an open prevalence of this entity in children younger than 15 years, as well as severe respiratory complications in affected patients. Emphasis is made on the importance of early diagnosis and adequate treatment of affections of high respiratory passages, which allows an orientation to avoid future bronchiectasis and sinusopathies. Genetic aspects, as well as incidence of suffering variants, are mentioned. Emphasis is made on specific nursing procedures of this syndrome.</dc:description>
