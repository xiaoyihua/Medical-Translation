<dc:description xml:lang="en">Twenty-four families with at least one patient with congenital cataract in each were studied. In eleven families (45%), the etiology was genetically determined (mendelian or chromosomal) and in the rest, it was not established. Bender's test was done to six patients which had more errors than expected for their chronological age; this suggests the importance of an early diagnosis of cataracts in order to correct and/or rehabilitate the eye lesions which are affecting the psychomotor development. Finally, family studies are needed for genetic counselling.</dc:description>
