<dc:description xml:lang="en">The cervical sprain, also known as Whiplash Syndrome, is a frequent pathology that produces high economic losses by year in the big cities. The most common mechanism most for whiplash, is the automobile accident with collision in the backside of the car, although it can be caused by other mechanisms. The pathophysiology of the whiplash syndrome is poorly understood, therefore the treatment is controversial and poorly described in the literature. Many signs and symptoms are reported, some of which are related to poor prognosis and are rarely reported. While making the diagnosis work-up, plain X-rays have low sensibility compared to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the detection of changes. The electroneurophysiology studies should be considered for using them in a routine basis, and when alterations appear, it is recommended to use MRI. Unfortunatelly, the rehabilitation treatments for whiplash syndrome have not been scientifically evaluated, thus there is few supportive evidence of the benefits and effectiveness from said treatments. It is very important to mention the treatment could be surgical.</dc:description>
