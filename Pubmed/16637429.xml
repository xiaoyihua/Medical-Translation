<dc:description xml:lang="en">Post-anesthesic parotiditis is a little known entity related with anesthesic procedures but described in any situation that motivates manipulation of the oropharyngeal cavity. Its physiopathological mechanism is not well-defined, although it could have a multifactorial origin. A case of a male who was admitted for post-operative control of brain tumor exeresis and who had preauricular and submaxillary inflammation after a routinely performed tracheostomy is presented. Coincidence with the performing of a tracheostomy required us to propose the differential diagnosis with the complications associated to said surgical act. Post-anesthesic parotiditis, even though it is a rare complication and has no clinical significance, should be kept in mind when there is facial edema after any manipulation of the oropharyngeal cavity.</dc:description>
