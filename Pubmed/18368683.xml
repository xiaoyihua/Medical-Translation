<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT There is a close relation between female sex hormones and migraine. Before puberty the incidence of migraine is the same in both sexes, but it becomes three times more frequent in females following menarche. Thus, approximately 25% of females of reproductive age suffer migraine versus 8% of males; above the age of fifty, however, the prevalence is again similar in the two sexes. Other evidence backing this theory include the existence of menstrual migraines, improvements in migraines between the fourth and ninth month of pregnancy and the fact that both contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy can modify the frequency and intensity of migraines. The changes in the characteristics of the migraines of females in different phases of their lives, such as puberty, pregnancy, lactation, menopause, and while they are using contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, are closely related to the concentrations of estrogens in the blood. This relation is even closer in the case of migraine without aura. AIMS The aim of this study was to review the changes that take place in the characteristics of the migraines suffered by women in the different stages of their lives (menstruation, pregnancy, lactation and menopause), as well as when using contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. We also sought to examine the therapeutic options that are indicated in each situation.</dc:description>
