<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To present a series of four cases of Gartner cysts and their clinical presentation. A bibliographic review was performed. METHODS The series consisted of 4 women, mean age 39, who complained of a bulge at the anterior vaginal wall, associated with a variety of urinary symptoms. RESULTS Surgical removal was performed in all cases. The pathological studies confirmed the diagnosis of Gartner cyst. There were no recurrences in the long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION Vaginal wall cysts are rarely found in common urological practice. Gartner cysts arise as a consequence of the Gartner duct (mesonephric remainder) obstruction and they are located in the anterior or lateral wall of the vagina. They may be associated with renal and ureteral anomalies. Differential diagnosis with other vaginal cysts can only be made by histological studies. The correct treatment is the entire removal through a vaginal approach.</dc:description>
