<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE The complications observed after 350 surgically treated retinal detachment in the Hospital Universitario de Málaga are retrospectively estudied. METHODS All the patients attended in our emergency service, surgically treated after retinal detachment diagnosis, are studied. Neither admission requirement nor preselection of patients was established for this study. RESULTS From the whole of 317 patients, 130 were myopic (41%); previous cataract surgery was present in 32.1%. Retinal reattachment was achieved in 67.9% after the first procedure, in 80.8% after a second and in 82.8% after the third. A relapsed detachment was observed in 112 cases (32%), 62 of which were retreated, observing in 20% a new tear as relapse cause. In one case (0.3%), a permanent central retinal artery after intravitreus gas injection was present. CONCLUSIONS Neither a prior selection of cases nor the establishment of admission criteria does contribute to a lower success rate after a first procedure. Only in 16.1% of retreated relapse detachment the persistent filtration of the treated tear could be involved as relapse cause. A case of complete blindness after intravitreous injection is worth-noting for its severity and dramatism.</dc:description>
