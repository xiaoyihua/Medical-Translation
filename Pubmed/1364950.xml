<dc:description xml:lang="en">The evaluation of spermatic morphology is of importance due to its prognostic value in potential male fertility, both in natural and in assisted reproduction. In the present work, the morphologic profile of samples of semen from normal and dispermic patients was determined, in order to establish a correlation between structure and function. Samples were obtained from male partners of infertile couples who attended andrologic consultation. The smears were stained by the Papanicolaou technique, and the criteria of the OMS and the recent modification of Kruger were followed to evaluate spermatic morphology. Of all the patients studied (n = 46), 35% were normospermics (A), 39% asthenospermics, 7% oligospermics, 2% terastospermics and 17% presented combined alterations. The average percentage of normal spermatozoa was of 23.7 +/- 1.23 in the whole population. When group A patients were compared with asthenospermics, significant differences were found in the percentage of spermatozoa with middle piece and tail alterations, in the last group (p &lt; 0.02). Similarly, when samples were analysed according to the presence of alterations: none (A), one (B) two or more (C), it was observed that the percentage of normal forms decreased in the groups in that order (A &lt; B &lt; C); (A or B vs C p &lt; 0.05). The percentage of tapering spermatozoa was significantly higher in group C (p &lt; 0.01 vs A or B). From the above results, it appears that 1) the larger number of functional alterations is related to a higher percentage of structural anomalies, and 2) the deficient motility in the asthenospermic group, is associated to the middle piece and tail alterations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
