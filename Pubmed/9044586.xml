<dc:description xml:lang="en">A retrospective study was made of 123 cases of nose injury seen in our hospital. Clinical and diagnosis aspects useful for the management of these injuries are discussed. Local inflammation, nosebleed, and deformity were the most common clinical signs. Most injuries were closed and about 80% were fractures. Immediate reduction under local anesthesia was the preferred treatment. The literature was reviewed and the technique is described.</dc:description>
