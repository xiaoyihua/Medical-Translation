<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The amount of chronic health problems in students is increasing with the time (food allergies, diabetes mellitus...). The presence of a school nurse in the educational sites could be the key to control this kind of health issues. OBJECTIVE Overhaul the function of a possible nurse in the schools of our region, with the target of trying to control and prevent diabetes mellitus and other illnesses. METHODOLOGY We have reviewed the figure of a school nurse and the diabetes care in non-university schools, using scientific sources of information and the own experience. RESULTS Many countries of the European environment are performing really important activities which have their benefits on the students'health; using the figure of a school nurse. However, the presence of this person is generally not constant in the educational sites, and requires some improvements. CONCLUSIONS We must promote the establishment of school nurses in Spain so that we can take care and prevent many health problems which mostly affect youth and childhood.</dc:description>
