<dc:description xml:lang="en">The treatment of patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome has not been very successful because of the number of variations that are associated with the illness. Some of them are: Depression and Anxiety, intensity of the symptoms and colonic hypersensitivity, all this, added to the unknown etiology of the illness. This review expects to bring a global vision of the difficulty that has existed for Medicine or psychology to bring the best treatment to these patients. Diverse investigations had obtained successful results with different psychotherapeutic approaches (Hypnotherapy, Psychoanalysis, cognitive therapy, multicomponent therapy, etc.). Nevertheless these present methodological errors that put in doubt those results. It is thought that interdisciplinary treatment would be a good option for these patients.</dc:description>
