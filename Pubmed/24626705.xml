<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To develop a composite index for coverage of antenatal and delivery continuum of care, and use it to measure the gaps among different populations of pregnant women in Mexico. MATERIALS AND METHODS Based in the information of 5 766 women from the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012, a composite index of coverage of continuum of care (Cobac in spanish) was developed, integrating five interventions for antenatal, delivery, and puerperium periods. RESULTS Women living in metropolitan areas who were affiliated to social security had the best Cobac (0.879; IC95%:0.867-0.891); the worst were found in women living in rural areas, with the lower socio-economic level (NSE-I), (0.722; IC95%: 0.700-0.745), women without health insurance (0.735; IC95%: 0.700-0.770), and indigenous women (0.759; IC95%: 0.740-0.779). CONCLUSIONS The Cobac during pregnancy and childbirth has important differences within the country, which allows for the identification of areas where we must focus efforts to move towards universal health coverage.</dc:description>
