<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Adrenal tumors of more than 6 cm diameter, also called macrotumors, cause diagnostic and therapeutic problems. AIM To perform an analysis of adrenal macrotumors diagnosed by CAT scan between 1984 and 1995. PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirty three patients aged 9 to 86 years old, 15 female, with an adrenal macrotumor diagnosed by CAT scan, were analyzed. RESULTS Thirty percent of tumors were functioning (70% secreted cathecolamines and 30% cortisol). Eighty two percent had an adrenal localization and 18% were para-adrenal. Thirty four percent were malignant. These tumors were mostly non functioning, 70% occurred in men and 67% were metastatic. CONCLUSIONS Most adrenal macrotumors in this series were non functioning and 36% were malignant.</dc:description>
