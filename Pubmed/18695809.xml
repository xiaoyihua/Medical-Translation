<dc:description xml:lang="en">Most of vaginal births are accompanied by lacerations in the genital tract. This was a randomized study carried out in a Birth Center located in São Paulo city to evaluate the efficacy of liquid petroleum jelly in reducing perineal laceration. The sample was composed of 38 nulliparous women per group (experimental and control). In the experimental group was used 30 ml of the petroleum jelly in the perineal region during the expulsive period. The parturient were allowed to push spontaneously during the delivery and remained in the left side position. The frequency of perineal laceration was similar in both groups (experimental 63.2% versus control 60.5%). The posterior perineum region presented the highest frequency of trauma (53.2%). Of the total cases of perineal trauma, 72.3% were first-degree lacerations. The use of liquid petroleum jelly of perineal protection does not reduce the frequency neither the degree of lacerations in childbirth.</dc:description>
