<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM The aim of this study is to determine the nature of venous flow in the lower extremities, as well as to correlate the velocity of the flow with average vein pressure in the right atrium. MATERIAL AND METHODS Over a period of one year 236 pulsated Doppler echographs were made of patients, bearers of a venous catheter located in the right atrium. The patients were in a supine lying position and breathing gently. The lines of the Doppler wave were used to analyse the frequency of the wave, the components of its velocity, the relationships of velocity and the existence of pulsatile flow. These parameters were compared with the pressure in the right atrium. RESULTS The study showed a cardiac and respiratory periodicity of the venous wave. A statistically significant correlation (p&lt;0.0001) was found between average venous pressure in the right atrium and the following variables: the systolic atrium wave (a), the diastolic atrium wave (d), the relation of pulsatility (RP=Velocity min/Velocity max) and the index of pulsatility (IP=[Velocity max-Velocity min]/Velocity average). CONCLUSION There is an inverse and significant relationship between pulsatile flow and atrium pressure. Nonetheless, although a relation exists between the different components of the venous wave, an elevation in central vein pressure cannot be predicted.</dc:description>
