<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To investigate whether omeprazole has improved morbidity-mortality among patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding of non-variceal origin in comparison with ranitidine. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective, randomized and open study. We study 519 consecutive patients admitted to our Service between June 1991 and January 1993 for upper gastrointestinal bleeding of peptic origin, dividing the patients into two randomized groups that were homogeneous in terms of age, sex, previous history of gastric disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, intake of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and the severity of bleeding on admittance. Thus, Group A consisted of 252 patients treated immediately upon arrival at the emergency ward with 50 mg intravenous ranitidine, followed by a further 50 mg every 6 hours. Group B in turn consisted of 267 patients initially given a bolus dose of 80 mg omeprazole intravenously, followed by an additional 40 mg every 8 hours for 48 hours. Forty mg were subsequently administered every 12 hours until hospital discharge. Endoscopy was performed in all cases within the first 24 hours following admittance, those patients with active upper gastrointestinal bleeding resulted from Forrest-type ulcer of subjected to endoscopic sclerotherapy were excluded. RESULTS Duodenal ulcer was the most common cause of bleeding, followed by gastric ulcer and acute lesions of the mucosa. Emphasis should be placed on the high incidence of previous non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug intake in our series (54.5%). We encountered no statistically significant differences between the two groups on comparing bleeding stigmata, transfusion requirements, recurrences, emergency surgery, the duration of hospital stay, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS Both drugs were found to possess a similar efficacy in treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding of peptic origin.</dc:description>
