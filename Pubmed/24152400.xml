<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective was to explore the usefulness of the logistic EuroSCORE to stratify the long-term survival curves in a sample of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The 8-year survival of 390 patients undergoing cardiac surgery between 2003 and 2004 was analyzed, according to the basal value of the EuroSCORE, patients were classified into three risk groups: &lt; 5%, 5-14.9% and &gt; 15%. Eight-years Kaplan-Meier's survival after coronary artery bypass grafting divided by the basal EuroSCORE was 83.5% for a basal risk &lt; 5%, 65.2% for a basal risk 5 to 14.9% and 40.0% for a basal risk &gt;15% (p = 0.000); whereas for valve or combined surgery it was 86.1%, 60.0% and 18.2% respectively (p = 0.0000). For all patients, ROC area was 0.759 (p = 0.000), for a EuroSCORE &lt; 5% it was 0.689 (p = 0.002), between 5 and 14.9% it was 0.544 (p = 0.499) and for &gt;15% it was 0.725 (p = 0.067). In conclusion, the logistic EuroSCORE allowed properly stratify the long-term survival curves in a sample of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, both the coronary and valve or combined surgery. Long-term results stratified by risk are a reasonable way to present late postoperative survival.</dc:description>
