<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Tuberculosis is a public health problem. The most common presentation is pulmonary disease. The diagnosis of any extrapulmonary forms are quite difficult. Clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal tuberculosis are non-specific and compatible with pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, advanced ovarian cancer, deep mycosis, yersinia infection and amebomas. Abdominal form is located at 6th place of the extrapulmonary forms, after lymphatic, genitourinary, osteoarticular, miliary and meningeal infections. Eventually, 25 to 75% of patients with abdominal tuberculosis will require surgery. These procedures should be limitated with the purpose to preserve small bowel. Resection should be limitated for complicated cases. The surgical indications include: Intestinal occlusion (15-60%), perforation (1-15%), abscesses and fistulas (2-30%) and hemorrhage (2%). CONCLUSIONS In most of the cases, the diagnosis of peritoneal or intestinal tuberculosis is made during a laparoscopy or laparotomy even during surgery performed by different purposes. Excessive manipulation of the intraabdominal organs may produced unexpected bowel lesions, increasing morbidity and mortality. Medical treatment is highly effective in the resolution of moderate complications such as bowel obstruction. Resectional procedures should be reserved for complications like perforation, bleeding or stenosis non-suitable for stricturoplasty.</dc:description>
