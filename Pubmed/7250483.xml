<dc:description xml:lang="en">It is usual for women to ask for temporary control of fertility during the puerperium. When hormonal therapy is administered, the selection of the adequate pill is very important. The effect of D-(-)-norgestrel 300mg was studied on uterine contractility values during puerperium is seven patients breast feeding and was compared with a control group of 26. The 33 patients had the following characteristics: multiparous during puerperium without recent episiotomy, with healthy cervix, absence of genital septic focus, uterine tumours or malformations; all of them breast feeding. In the hypothesis, it was considered that the endogenous oxytocin increases and stimulates the mammary mioepithelium and uterine contractilities. For recording uterine contractility, the technique of Jaumandreu and Hendricks was used. The recordings were made during 24 hours postpartum, and at 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days with a duration 2 to 3 hours. All the studies were longitudinal. The changes of the human uterine contractility during normal puerperium were estimated. The range of the tonus was 22--41 mm Hg, the intensity 5--18 mm Hg, the frequency 17--23 contractions in 10 minutes, and the uterine activity 102--223 Montevideo Units. In the control group the following results were obtained: The range of the tonus was 24--34 mm Hg, the intensity 9--16 mm Hg, the frequency 17--37 contractions in 10 minutes, and the uterine contractility 137--524 Montevideo Units. In the comparative study Student's t test was used and p estimated.</dc:description>
