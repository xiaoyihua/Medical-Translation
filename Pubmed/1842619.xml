<dc:description xml:lang="en">At the Files Department of the Matanzas Teaching Gynecological and Obstetrical Hospital, the case histories of the patients with heart disease and pregnancy were requested. These patients were cared for at the specialist outpatient treatment and the different wards of the hospital. Ten case histories were studied out of 3916 patients whose deliveries took place in 1988, accounting for 0.3 per cent of the total number of admissions. Such indicators as age showed a 20-25-year-old mode and a 26-year-old mean age. Primiparas had a higher incidence than those women with more than one delivery. Acquired heart diseases occurred in more than half of the cases. There were no results concerning perinatal mortality I and maternal mortality.</dc:description>
