<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND the osteogenic distraction is the treatment for the correction of the hypoplastic maxilla secondary to the repair of a cleft lip-palate. Its planning is based on articulated models. Our objective was to describe the accuracy of three-dimensional Cephalometry (CT3D) for projecting jaw displacement. METHODS three patients with hypoplastic maxilla. Interventions estimation of the advance required of lateral maxilla through Cephalometry of skull (CLC), CT3D and an articulated model (gold standard). Two months after distraction finalized the advance predicted was compared. RESULTS the error of the advance projection in each patient was smaller with the CT3D versus CLC (+1, +1 and +1 mm versus -10, -14 and -9mm). Corrections post-distraction were of +25 %, +26 % and +38.4 % on the programmed one. CT3D predicted better the correction (+19 %, +10.8 %, +33.4 % versus CLC: -50 %; -60.8 % and -34.6 %). Chewing alterations were not seen in any patient. CONCLUSIONS the planning of the necessary advance for distraction in patients with hypoplastic maxilla by CT3D can shorten the time of studies and should be consider as next to the projection of articulated model.</dc:description>
