<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of 4 techniques for internal saphenous nerve block with 10 mL of 1.5% mepivacaine. METHODS Eighty ASA I-II patients scheduled for foot (hallux valgus) surgery with combined sciatic and saphenous nerve blocks were randomized to receive the saphenous nerve block by one of the following techniques: a paravenous approach (n = 20), a transsartorial approach (n = 20), a femoral nerve approach in the inguinal region using a nerve stimulator (n = 20), and by subcutaneous infiltration between the tibial tuberosity and the internal gastrocnemius muscle (n = 20). A pressure cuff was placed 10 cm below the knee of all patients. Success was assessed by pin prick inside the ankle 30 minutes after initiation of the block. Tolerance of the pressure cuff and discomfort during performance of the technique were also assessed. RESULTS The 4 groups were similar as to distribution of males and females and mean weight, age, and height. Blocking the saphenous nerve by way of the femoral nerve in the inguinal region was the most effective approach (success in 95% of patients), significantly better than the other 3 techniques (P &lt; 0.05). The paravenous approach was successful in 60% of cases, the transsartorial approach in 50%, and the subcutaneous infiltration technique in 45%. The pressure cuff was well tolerated by all patients (100%) in whom the femoral nerve approach was used. The cuff was tolerated by 70% in the paravenous approach group, by 65% in the transsartorial approach group, and by 60% in the subcutaneous infiltration group. Patients reported more discomfort during initiation of the blockade in the paravenous approach and subcutaneous infiltration groups than in the femoral nerve or transsartorial approach groups (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION The femoral nerve approach in the inguinal region, with nerve stimulator, to block the internal saphenous nerve led to a larger number of successful blocks than did the paravenous or transsartorial approaches, or the technique of subcutaneous infiltration between the tibial tuberosity and internal gastrocnemius muscle.</dc:description>
