<dc:description xml:lang="en">Children under 18 months of age, with primary moderate and severe malnutrition, were treated by a multiprofessional team with an ambulatory system. The prospective effect of intensive psychosensorial stimulation over psychomotor development and physical growth was studied. Control (41 children) and experimental (55 children) groups were compared when the program started and successively followed up after 6 and 12 months. The experimental group were given intensive psychosensorial stimulation at home by their mothers. They were trained and periodically inspected by nurses. Both groups were matched by age, sex and birthweight. They all came from very poor families. Mean age when the program started was 10.4 months. Weight for age, weight for height, height for age (Standard NCHS), serum albumin, serum iron, transferrin saturation, TIBC were evaluated. Psychomotor development was evaluated with Rodríguez S. (EEDP) and Brunet Lezine scales. Both groups had similar increment in weight for age, weight for height, serum iron and transferrin saturation. No change was observed in height for age, serum albumin and TIBC. Psychomotor development improved more in the experimental group (p less than 0.01), coming to normal range in most children in that group. To conclude, intensive psychosensorial stimulation in malnourished children is not shown to improve physical growth but does improve psychomotor development (malnutrition, psychomotor development, physical growth, psychosensorial stimulation).</dc:description>
