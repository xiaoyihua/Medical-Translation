<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Establishing the prevalence of abnormal and inflammation cytology reports and its association with risks factors for uterine cervical neoplasms amongst females from the Cauca department in Colombia. METHODOLOGY After signing a consent-form, females were interviewed using a questionnaire to collect socio-demographic and clinical data, including reproductive history, sexual activity, cytology history and smoking habits. Cytology was then taken for analysis and classification according to the 2001 Bethesda System. A total of 1,735 females were recruited for the study. RESULTS According to the cytology report, 1061 women had normal cytology (61 %), 36 abnormal cytology (2 %) and 638 reactive cellular changes associated with inflammation (37 %). The results indicated that having sexual intercourse at an early age, multiparity, using hormonal contraceptives and not having annual cytology screening were associated with abnormal cytology reports. CONCLUSIONS These results provided valuable information for public health institutions for developing better screening programmes to prevent risks of uterine cervical neoplasms amongst females from our region and throughout Colombia.</dc:description>
