<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The renin-angiotensin system (SRA) acts on the bone metabolism and decreases the mineralization. Menopausal women frequently are hypertense and have risk of developing osteoporosis. The inhibition of SRA could favour the mineralization and protect the bone mass of hypertense women in treatment with antihypertensive drugs that are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. PATIENTS AND METHOD Cohorts prospective study. 50 menopausal women were recruited and divided in one cohort of non hypertense patients and one cohort of hypertense women who initiated antihypertensive treatment with oral fosinopril. Baseline and after 1 year bone mineral density of lumbar spine and femoral neck was made. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the bone mass of both groups. Significant changes between the baseline and after the treatment were not demonstrated in the cohort exposed. In the group of non exposed women were demonstrated differences in lumbar spine (baseline, 0.874 g/cm(2); final, 0.854 g/cm(2); p = 0.002) and femoral neck (baseline, 0.743 g/cm(2); final, 0.725 g/cm(2); p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS The menopausal and hypertense women who followed treatment with fosinopril did not present the physiological loss of bone mass that affected to menopausal women without treatment.</dc:description>
