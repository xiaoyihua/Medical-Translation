<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Although the mortality due to cerebrovascular disease in Spain has been considerably reduced in the past twenty years, at all ages and in both sexes, it is still the second cause of death in men and first in women. OBJECTIVE To describe the mortality due to cerebrovascular disease in Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyse a time series over a period of 45 years (1951-1995) by age, sex, period of death (calendar year) and cohort of birth, the geographical distribution in the last five year period available (1991-1995), and compared with other industrial countries. RESULTS The mortality due to cerebrovascular disease in Spain has dropped over the past twenty years. This fall has accelerated over the past five years, mainly in the older age groups. Both effects, period and cohort, are seen in this drop. There is marked male predominance. The geographical distribution is in a north-south pattern. At an international level, mortality due to cerebrovascular disease in Spain is medium-low, although in some provinces it is high. CONCLUSIONS Efforts to reduce the incidence and severity of cerebrovascular disease are essential to reduce mortality. It is necessary to continue investigations as to the true impact of this group of disorders, incidence, gravity and mortality, and the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors in the whole population.</dc:description>
