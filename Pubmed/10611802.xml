<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Gadolinium-DTPA used as a contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging allows the detection and quantification of the necrotic area in acute myocardial infarction. The aim of the present study is to assess the value of this method for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in comparison with clinical and echocardiographic data. METHODS Contrast magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiographic studies were performed on 16 patients during the first week after admission for acute myocardial infarction. Necrotic and total myocardial mass were calculated from magnetic resonance images and this was compared to the extension of the myocardial infarction assessed by electrocardiography and the peak level of total creatinine-phosphokinase serum enzyme. The number and localization of myocardial segments showing contrast uptake was related to segments with contractile abnormalities at the echocardiographic exam. RESULTS The mean value of the mass of myocardial necrosis calculated from the total area of gadolinium-DTPA uptake in each patient was 25 g (range: 2-67 g), corresponding to 17% of the total myocardial mass (range: 1-45%). This value correlated with the peak serum level of total creatinine-phosphokinase enzyme (r = 0.714; p &lt; 0.003) and with the number of Q waves present at the electrocardiogram (r = 0.69; p &lt; 0.005). A very good agreement between the location of the myocardial infarction by ECG, echocardiography and magnetic resonance was evidenced, and a satisfactory correlation existed between myocardial segments with gadolinium-DTPA uptake and akinetic echocardiographic segments (kappa = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS The detection and quantitation of the necrotic area in the acute myocardial infarction with gadolinium-DTPA contrast magnetic resonance shows a good correlation with clinical and echocardiographic data.</dc:description>
