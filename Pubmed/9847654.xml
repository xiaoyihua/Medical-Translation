<dc:description xml:lang="en">A potential space between the dura mater and the arachnoides is thought to exist, occupied by a serous fluid and called the subdural space. Recent studies may change this classical concept, however. The dura-arachnoid complex from the epidural to the arachnoid space is formed by morphologically distinct layers: the dura mater, the subdural compartment and the arachnoid mater, which are made up of different cell types. The dura mater consists of greater and lesser laminae formed mainly of collagen fibers aligned differently. The subdural compartment is formed by a number of so-called "neurothelial cells", which are in close contact with the inner dural layers. These cells are flat and have long interlaced branches. The arachnoides are made of cells grouped in three different layers. The outer layer is the "barrier arachnoid layer". Located just inside the anterior cell plane, this layer is made of less flattened cells that form an epithelial-type tissue, with complex cell-cell junctures surrounded by collagen fibers. The middle layer is the reticular arachnoid, composed of irregularly interlaced cells alternating with collagen fibers and intercellular gaps of varying sizes. The innermost layer, the trabecular arachnoid, is in direct contact with the subarachnoid space. The cells of this layer form strands that contribute to the weblike pattern found in the subarachnoid space. Recently, special techniques for fixing and preparing samples, preserving in situ the anatomical relations between the arachnoides and the dura mater, have allowed us to examine the normal configuration of the subdural space. All samples examined revealed the presence of a cellular plane between the dura mater and the arachnoides, with no evidence of the classically described space. The zone of least resistance in the dura-arachnoid complex was the subdural compartment, which could be torn mainly along intercellular spaces, though cell rupture was also observed, affecting the cytoplasmic membranes of adjacent cells. The subdural space is opened by tearing the subdural compartment between neurothelial cells alongside the collagen fibers of the dura mater. Such a tear can be caused mechanically by injecting air or contrast media, which exert pressure on a laminar structure that tends to separate because it is weaker than neighboring ones.</dc:description>
