<dc:description xml:lang="en">Electric stimulation of the greater splanchnic nerve produced short-lasted maximum effects on the renal function ranging between 4 to 8 minutes, during which glomerular filtration and diuresis were annulled, to later increase up to values close to those of the controls in spite of stimulation being maintained, and become stabilized after discontinuation at values similar to the previous control. Analogous changes occurred in blood pressure, central venous pressure, heart and respiratory rates, which consisted in maximum effects during the first minute of stimulation, to immediately initiate a gradual return to control values with fluctuations that translate the activation of regulatory mechanisms. These results show that neuroadrenergic effects due to electric stimulation of the greater splanchnic nerve which cause vasoconstriction and ischaemia of the renal parenchyma, as well as other cardiovascular alterations, are significant but short-lasted, suggesting that they do not necessary result by themselves in irreversible organic lesions.</dc:description>
