<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The origin of functional dyspepsia (FD) is unknown, however, abnormal gastric emptying and infection by H. pylori have been suggested as possible causes. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that infection by H. pylori could be related to alterations in gastric emptying of solids and play a role in the pathophysiology of dyspepsia. METHODS Studies were performed on 12 controls: 6 males, 6 females, age 40 +/- 13, and on 45 FD patients: 15 males and 30 females, age 43.5 +/- 12. Clinical criteria for FD diagnosis were post-prandial epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting or epigastric bloating, with normal blood test, upper endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound. Diagnosis of H. pylori infection was either by growth positive on culture of antral biopsy or by all of the following: on Gram stain, urease test positive and visualization of microorganisms in the antral biopsy. Gastric emptying of solids was studied with a radio-nuclide technique. Patients were prospectively classified in 4 groups according to the main symptom: reflux-like, ulcer-like, dysmotility, and non-specific. RESULTS H. pylori infection was observed in 21/32 (66%) FD patients. No significant differences in the gastric emptying of solids between the control group and patients with FD (tl/2 80 +/- 17 minutes vs 75 +/- 16 min). The presence of H. pylori infection did not influence gastric emptying rates (78 +/- 16 minutes in infected patients vs 73 +/- 15 min in non infected patients). Gastric emptying times were similar among the four subgroups of FD patients. CONCLUSIONS No significant differences in gastric emptying of solids were found in H. pylori infected persons as compared with the controls. These findings suggest that H. pylori infection and/or changes in gastric emptying of solids do not play a role in the pathophysiology of FD.</dc:description>
