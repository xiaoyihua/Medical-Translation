<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE to compare pregnant adolescents of 15 and 19 years old to non-pregnant adolescents of the same age group with active sexual life in order to explore the existing relationship of the social and cultural barriers and the accessing of methods of birth control. METHODS a case-control study was performed in a six month period at Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. The cases included pregnant adolescents of 15-19 years of age; the controls were non-pregnant adolescents with an active sexual life of the same age group. The size of the sample was of 96 adolescents, 48 cases and 48 controls. It was calculated RM to obtain associations of a 95 % IC. RESULTS the non-utilization of birth control methods was associated with pregnancy (OR = 2.78, CI 95 % = 1.21-6.36), low education (OR = 2.66, 95 % CI = 0.97-7.29), and no medical service access (OR = 2.23, CI 95 % = 0.96-5.18). CONCLUSIONS the social and cultural barriers were associated with pregnancy during the adolescence.</dc:description>
