<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION We conducted a retrospective analysis of our series to assess the factors that influenced disease-free survival (DFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) for patients with localised renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We also created our own risk groups. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 1990 and December 2012, 596 patients underwent surgery for localised RCC (clear cell, papillary or chromophobe). Using Cox regression models, we analysed the clinical-pathological variables that influenced DFS and CSS and designed risk groups for DFS and CSS with the variables. RESULTS The median follow-up for the series was 5.96 years. By the end of the study, 112 patients (18.8%) had a recurrence of the disease, with DFS rates of 82%, 77% and 72% at 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. The independent factors that influenced DFS in the multivariate study were the following: A Furhman grade of 3-4, haematuria, lymphocytic or vascular invasion, the presence of tumour necrosis and a disease stage pT3-pT4. Furthermore, by the end of the study, 57 patients (9.6%) died due to renal cancer, with CSS rates of 92%, 86% and 83% at 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. The independent factors that influenced CSS in the multivariate study were the following: A Furhman grade of 3-4, perinephric fat invasion and the presence of tumour necrosis. CONCLUSIONS Factors in addition to the disease stage pT3-pT4 in patients with localised RCC are important, such as the presence of haematuria and lymphocytic or vascular invasion for DFS. A Furhman grade of 3-4 and the presence of tumour necrosis are especially relevant for DFS and CSS.</dc:description>
