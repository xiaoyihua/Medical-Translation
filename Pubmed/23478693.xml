<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The prevalence of hyponutrition among hospitalized patients varies between 30 to 50%, increasing both the morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of hyponutrition in diabetic and non-diabetic patients at the General Surgery Department. METHODS Prospective, observation, and longitudinal study assessing the nutritional status by means of VGS, CONUT, and MNA. RESULTS 384 patients: 97 surgical diabetic patients, incidence of hyponutrition assessed by VGS 28.8%, by MNA among patients older than 65 years 54.28%. Two hundred and eighty seven non-diabetic surgical patients were assessed with an incidence of hyponutrition of 12.9%, and of 52.94% by MNA. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of hyponutrition in surgical diabetic patients is twofold higher than in non-diabetic patients. Elder diabetic and non-diabetic surgical patients show the same incidence of hyponutrition. Given the high incidence of hyponutrition in surgical patients admitted to the General Surgery Department, the nutritional status should be assessed by means of a protocolled method, at admission by VSG or MNA if they are older than 65 years, and admitted patients should be followed by using CONUT.</dc:description>
