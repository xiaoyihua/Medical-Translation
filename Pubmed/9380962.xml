<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Surgical treatment is the first option for patients with obstructive multinodular goiter. The extent of the resection and the use of postoperative hormonal therapy are, on the other hand, still under debate. OBJECTIVE To analyze the results of surgical treatment in 101 patient with multinodular goiter seen from 1980 to 1995. MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical/pathologic charts of all patients were reviewed with emphasis to the clinical diagnosis, extent of resection, final histology, type and number of complications, and long-term follow-up. The mean follow-up was three years (range 0.5-12). RESULTS Ten males and 91 females with a mean age of 46 years were included. Surgery was recommended for a nodule suspicious of malignancy in 60 patients, for airway compression in 33, and for cosmetic reasons in eight. Unilateral lobectomy was performed in 30, bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy in 55 and total thyroidectomy in 16. Postoperative hormone therapy was administrated to 83 patients. Surgical complications occurred in six patients. Four developed permanent hypoparathyroidism and two vocal cord paralysis. There was no operative mortality. A final diagnosis of multinodular goiter was established in 89 whereas 12 had cancer. There were three asymptomatic recurrences in the group with benign lesions (they had undergone unilateral lobectomy followed by hormonal therapy). CONCLUSION Bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy was the best treatment for multinodular goiter in our series. This procedure had few complications and there was no recurrence of the disease.</dc:description>
