<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Accurate subtyping of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is crucial for the effective management of this disease and it is particularly important to distinguish between aggressive and nonaggressive histologic variants. Histologic subtype is not always accurately identified by biopsy and this can have serious implications. High-resolution ultrasound (HRUS) is a recent technique that has proven to be of value in differentiating between variants of BCC. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential usefulness of HRUS for detecting invasive disease in recurrent BCC treated nonsurgically following an initial diagnosis of noninvasive BCC by biopsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a prospective observational study of consecutive cases of BCC with clinical suspicion of recurrence following nonsurgical treatment and a pretreatment diagnosis of superficial BCC by punch biopsy. Before surgical excision, the recurrent lesions were evaluated by HRUS followed by a punch biopsy of the site of suspected recurrence. The diagnostic agreement between HRUS, punch biopsy, and excisional biopsy was then evaluated. RESULTS Eight lesions were studied. HRUS identified invasive disease in 3 of the 4 cases that were incorrectly classified as superficial subtypes by punch biopsy. CONCLUSION HRUS could be useful for detecting persistent tumor after nonsurgical treatment and for choosing the site most likely to harbor invasive disease for punch biopsy.</dc:description>
