<dc:description xml:lang="en">Children with physical, psychological and sensorial disabilities are known to be more vulnerable to violence and maltreatment, or to be at a greater risk of these forms of abuse. Violence and maltreatment of children with disabilities is part of the general problem of child maltreatment, which is still under-researched and little known as a whole; prevention, in particular, has received little attention. Preventing violence and maltreatment against children with disabilities means preventing physical pain, emotional suffering, difficulties in integration and sequelae additional to those already experienced by children due to their disability, in addition to avoiding great expense to the community. This article presents a review of the literature published in the last 10 years on the various primary and secondary prevention strategies that have taken place in developed countries, with the aim of bringing the subject to public attention, especially that of health professionals, and of serving as a basis for the planning of future research lines and prevention strategies.</dc:description>
