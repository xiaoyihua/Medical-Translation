<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of the present paper was to study the effects of adenosine (ADO) on automaticity and after potential oscillations on canine cardiac Purkinje fibers. ADO concentrations from 10(-8) to 10(-5) M were used. The intracellular electrical activity was recorded with conventional microelectrodes. ADO increased during the first two minutes the basic cycle length (BLC) with concentrations higher than 10(-8) M, to a value 50% above control, later there is a progression to a steady state. The dose-response curve in the steady state is sigmoidal and resembles those of receptor occupation. The slopes of pacemaker potentials have a tendency to decrease along with the increase in BLC length. After potential oscillations decrease with 10(-8) M of ADO but not with larger concentrations. There results supports the hypothesis that ADO produces an increase in the time independent potassium current similar to the one described for atrial and ventricular myocytes. This effect probably depends on specific receptor stimulation. The biphasic time course suggests the existence of subtypes of A1 receptor with different dissociation constants and affinities but with similar actions. The idea that the ADO effects depend mainly on the potassium currents and not on I(f) is supported by the absence of a dose-dependent effects in the oscillatory after potentials.</dc:description>
