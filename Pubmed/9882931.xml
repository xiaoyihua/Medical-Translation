<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND In recent years, the usefulness of programs for the prevention of colorectal cancer has been demonstrated in the general population as well as on specific risk groups. However, its implantation rate is unknown in our area. This study was aimed at evaluating the level of introduction of colorectal cancer screening. METHOD A telephonic survey has been carried out using a pre-established questionnaire to find out if the interviewed had undergone a fecal occult blood test, digital rectal examination, barium enema and/or colorectal endoscopy with the final aim of colorectal cancer prevention. Moreover, the knowledge of both above mentioned explorations and the colorectal cancer clinical manifestations have also been evaluated. Individual characteristics determining these aspects have also been investigated. RESULTS Only two (0.8%) of the 250 subjects included had undergone a screening procedure (digital rectal examination). In contrast, in female population, 142 women (82%) had been included in a surveillance program to detect early signs of breast or gynecological cancer. In addition, a low level of knowledge of these explorations has been observed (digital rectal examination: 58%; colorectal endoscopy: 56%; barium enema: 44%; fecal occult blood test: 41%). This low level was also observed regarding to clinical manifestations associated with colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS In contrast with gynecological cancer, colorectal cancer screening has not yet been introduced in Catalonia. Moreover, the knowledge of the available information regarding to preventive strategies is very low.</dc:description>
