<dc:description xml:lang="en">The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the agent that causes AIDS, a disease known for 30 years that has reached pandemic proportions. Its origin dates back to human transmission of retroviruses infecting populations of chimpanzees in central Africa about 100 years ago. From this location its expansion to the whole world has been phenomenal, particularly in recent decades. Extensive research has led to an effective treatment for controlling virus replication and to prevent progression of the disease, but we do not yet have a vaccine to prevent the continuing spread of the pandemic. It is not possible to understand these phenomena without detailed knowledge of the biology of HIV-1 and the mechanisms that have been selected in this amazing agent to infect a key cell such as the CD4 + T cell and evade the immune response.</dc:description>
