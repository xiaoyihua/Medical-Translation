<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate if there exist an association between the % of normal forms and the kinetic characteristics in human spermatozoa MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study was performed to analyze semen samples of 203 patients by Computer Assisted Semen Analysis. Sperm morphology was evaluated by the aid of a micrometric objective according to strict criteria. Only the patients presenting &gt;20 x 106 sperm/ml and &gt; 50% of progressive motility were included. Data from 168 patients were divided according to the % of normal forms in three groups a) &lt;4% (n=22), b) between 4-13% (n=89) and c) &gt;14% (n=57). Data collected among groups were compared. In order to select a motile sperm population 35 samples were treated by a discontinuous gradient and the % of normal forms as well as motility parameters evaluated before and after selection. RESULTS The kinetic analysis showed that sperm concentration, the % of motile and rapid spermatozoa (&gt;25 microm/s) as well as the average path velocity (VAP) and the lateral head displacement (LHD) were increased in association with the % of normal spermatozoa presenting the lowest values in the group &lt;4% with respect to the &gt; or = 14% group, (p&lt;0.05). Linearity (LIN) remained constant among groups. Kinetic parameters and sperm morphology were significantly increased (p&lt;0.0001) in the selected samples Results showed that the use of gradients even in teratozoospermic samples improves significantly the % of normal forms respect to baseline values (p&lt;0.0002). CONCLUSIONS Our results would support the hypothesis that morphologically better spermatozoa would be associated with those with better movement parameters measured in an objective way. In this manner we could suggest that in vivo the best spermatozoa would comprise one "elite" in the journey through the fertilization site.</dc:description>
