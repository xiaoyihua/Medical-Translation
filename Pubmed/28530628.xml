<dc:description xml:lang="en">Continued progresses in the field of laparoscopy have been introduced in urological surgery. With the development of smaller instrumental minilaparoscopy was born seeking to reduce abdominal trauma and improve cosmetic scars, obtaining similar or better results than conventional laparoscopy. OBJECTIVE The objective of this paper is to evaluate the results and reproducibility of mini-laparoscopic pyeloplasty. METHODS A literature review and a bibliographic search in PubMed were performed. We describe the technique used in the "Hospital Marqués de Valdecilla" (HUMV), Santander (Spain). RESULTS 60 articles about mini-laparoscopy were found. Although there are few reported minilap pyeloplasty series, they offer excellent cosmetic and functional results. We analyze operative time, complications, postoperative hospital stay, conversion rate, functional and cosmetic results, and we compare them with conventional laparoscopic pyeloplasty. CONCLUSIONS More reported series are necessary but it has been proved that minilap pyeloplasty is a reproducible and safe technique with excellent results.</dc:description>
