<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of the surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is to achieve its complete cure, evidenced by normal serum calcium in the postoperative period. Measurement of intraoperative serum parathormone (PTH) can be useful to predict complete cure of the disease. AIM To assess the usefulness of intraoperative PTH measurement to predict complete cure of PHPT. MATERIAL AND METHODS Serum PTH was measured to all patients operated for PHPT between 2003 and 2008, before and five and ten minutes after the excision of the parathyroid gland causing the disease. The criteria for complete cure were normal serum calcium at 24 hours and 6 months after surgery and the pathological confirmation of parathyroid gland excision. RESULTS Eighty-eight operated patients, aged 58+/-15 years (72 females) were studied. Sixty four percent were asymptomatic and their preoperative serum calcium was 11.6+/- 1.2 mg/dl. A normal serum calcium was achieved in 86 patients (98%) at 24 hours and 50 of 52 patients followed for six months (96%). The pathological study disclosed an adenoma in 69 (78%), and multiglandular disease in 16 (18%), a parathyroid cancer in one and a normal gland in one patient. Intraoperative PTH predicted early and definitive cure in 97% and 100% of patients with a single adenoma, respectively. Among patients with multiglandular disease, the predictive figures were 94% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative PTH measurement efficiently predicts early and definitive surgical cure of PHPT.</dc:description>
