<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Treatment of grade III Rockwood acromioclavicular lesions continues to be controversial. A new surgical technique for reduction using minimally invasive surgery provides good results. The purpose of this paper is to present the short and medium-term results of a series of patients with grade III acromioclavicular dislocations who underwent surgery. METHODS Prospective assessment of a series of 14 patients with acromioclavicular dislocation who underwent surgery from May 2009 to June 2010 consisting of open reduction and synthesis with coracoclavicular fixation with a double anchor. Radiologic, functional and personal satisfaction parameters were assessed. RESULTS Statistically significant radiologic results were obtained, which reflect a correct reduction. An "excellent" mean score was obtained in the functional assessment using the Imatani test. Patients reported subjective satisfaction during the interviews at the outpatient visits. CONCLUSIONS There are only a few papers reporting postoperative results with this surgical technique. Without a control group it is not possible to make a comparison with orthopedic treatment, so comparisons were made with published series using classical techniques. The surgical technique provides similar results; it is simple, inexpensive and has not shown to have any postoperative complications during a mean follow-up of 13.7 months. Surgical treatment of grade III acromioclavicular lesions using this surgical technique has provided appropriate results in this group of patients.</dc:description>
