<dc:description xml:lang="en">After describing the affections caused by the virus Coxsackie, the characteristics of disease in mouth-hands-feet are looked over reporting the principal epidemic outbreak as well as the isolated forms of exhibition. The illness can be shown in a complete, incomplete or moderate way. This outbreak occurred in Mendoza (Argentina) in 1975-1976: 25 school aged children were controlled and no other relatives of different ages fell ill. No predisposition for either sex. They didn't come from the same school. A sudden eclosion and without general display. In some of them the buccal were absent. All of them had palm and sole lesions and only four of them had buttock lesions. Everybody recovered after a short eruptive period and without any complications.</dc:description>
