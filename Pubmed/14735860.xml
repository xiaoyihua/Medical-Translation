<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The association between testosterone and prostate cancer badly is understood. The testosterone levels are not conclusive to distinguish benign prostate processes of malignant. The objective of our work is to determine the relation between levels of serum testosterone and prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHOD 38 patients with prostate cancer and a control group of 32 were studied in prospective form, with ages that fluctuated between the 50 and 80 years. The total and free testosterone was determined by radio-immunoensayo. The statistical analysis was descriptive inferential, with bands of 95% confidence. RESULTS The average values of total and free testosterone, were significantly smaller in patients with prostate cancer. Any correlation between gleason, prostate antigen and stage with testosterone, was not demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS Our work demonstrated that the testosterone is significantly smaller in the patients with prostate cancer that in the controls.</dc:description>
