<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cyproterone acetate acts as an antiandrogen through competitive inhibition of the androgens at cellular level on the peripheral effectors. Associated with ethynyl estradiol potentiates its action upon the cutaneous effectors, and at the same time has a potent ovulostatic action. Forty one women with seborrhea, acne, hirsutism and androgenic alopecia were treated. In 18 cases serum testosterone level were measured by radioimmunoassay before treatment. Most had levels above the normal range. In 7 cases testosterone level were repeated during treatment. Some did not show changes, but in most testosterone plasma increased. Most of the cases with acne and seborrhea showed a definite improvement between 3 and 6 months. Alopecia and hirsutism needed a longer treatment and the results were not so satisfactory. The tolerance was excellent and the side effects were those usually found with other oestrogens and gestagens associations. No rebound was observed when the medication was discontinued, although most of the cases showed a tendency to mild recurrence.</dc:description>
