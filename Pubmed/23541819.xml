<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To quantify and to describe the characteristics of use of an Emergency Medical Service by children in Bilbao City (Spain). PATIENTS AND METHODS An observational and retrospective study was performed taking patients younger than 15 years old who were served by Basic Life Support Units from an Emergency Medical Service for 4 consecutive years (2008-2011). RESULTS 525 interventions were registered (anual range 102-155 interventions), which represented 2.25% of total services. 54.5% (p&lt;0,001) of patients were male. The mean age was 7.6 years old (95% CI 6.8 to 7.5). The causes of action were associated to accidental causes in 49.1% of cases and disease in 50.9% (p=0,44), with a predominance of injuries in the 5 to 9 years (p&lt;0,001) and disease among children under 5 years (p&lt;0,001). The main disorders observed were injuries (41.9%), convulsive episodes (17.1%) and respiratory symptoms (10.3%). 78.9% need to transfer to health care center. CONCLUSIONS The volume of pediatric care carried out between 2008 and 2011 has not changed annually. The main visits were due to traumas and convulsions. Most emergency situations are not resolved on the spot, being necessary to transfer to hospital.</dc:description>
