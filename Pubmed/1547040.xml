<dc:description xml:lang="en">We show the results of a retrospective study carried out during ten years (1978-1987), in Catalonia in the provinces of Barcelona and Gerona. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory chronic bowel disease in our country, its clinical aspects, management and long term survival. An epidemiological inquiry was sent to all the hospitals and gastroenterologists of Catalonia. Nine hundred and seventy six answers were received from 20 Hospitals and four specialists. All of them were revised by the Research Committee, and 761 were validated for their inclusion in the study. The prevalence of the disease was similar both in Barcelona (19 per 100,000) and Gerona (18 per 100,000). The incidence of ulcerative colitis increased during the study, from 0.4 in 1978 to 0.8 in 1987, with a peak of maximum incidence (1.0 per 100,000) in 1985. In the same way, an increase in the incidence of Crohn's disease from 0.2 to 0.7 per 100,000, was observed. The mean incidence per year was 0.6 and 0.4 respectively, similar to the incidence observed in other Spanish regions during the same period of time. Finally we show the most important clinical and therapeutic aspects as well as the survival data.</dc:description>
