<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this study was to identify the knowledge and attitudes towards breastfeeding and towards breastfeeding in public of a group of high school students in the Caguas Educational Region. The study design was a descriptive survey. The sample consisted of 101 students registered in the Health Course. A self administered questionnaire was used to gather the information. Descriptive and inferential statistics (chi square and t test) were used for data analysis. We found that the majority of the participants have the intention of breastfeeding or supporting breastfeeding for their children. We found, nevertheless, that there were misconceptions regarding breastfeeding which could develop into barriers for effective breastfeeding. It was also observed that support for breastfeeding varied depending on the location where it took place. Support was greater if it was done in non-public places. In conclusion, it became evident that there is a need for educational programs with correct information on breastfeeding and the importance of breastfeeding in public.</dc:description>
