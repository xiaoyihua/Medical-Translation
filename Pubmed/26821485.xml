<dc:description xml:lang="en">Evidence is increasing that breastfeeding beyond its well-established beneficial effects during the breastfeeding period, also confers long-term benefits, particularly in the prevention of risk factors for non-communicable diseases. Therefore, we sought to identify the latest evidence about the benefits of breastfeeding later in life. We searched on PubMed for published studies assessing the effects of breastfeeding on risk factors for non-communicable diseases later in life (cardiovascular risk factors, obesity/overweight, type-2 diabetes and inflammation). Out of 75 references identified, 31 were included in this revision to review the available evidence on long-term benefits of breastfeeding. The search was completed on December 2014. Some of the reviewed studies suggest that breastfeeding may offer protection to develop risk factors for non-communicable diseases later in life, and also have been proposed several mechanisms for a protective effect of breastfeeding against non-communicable diseases. Although there is more evidence of overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease these is inconclusive. There is a lack of evidence for type-2 diabetes and inflammation, therefore it is difficult to conclude. Although the majority of the studies are observational and this is a limitation to prove causality, the results of this article may provide support to breastfeeding policies.</dc:description>
