<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Data on the prevalence of obesity in elderly population in Spain are scarce. The objective of this work was to describe the prevalence of obesity and the related factors in a random sample of Spanish population aged 60 years-old or more, stratified by autonomous communities. SUBJECTS AND METHOD We analyzed the PREV-ICTUS study, a population-based study carried out between September and December 2005 in a random sample stratified by autonomous communities according to the census of inhabitants and the habitat in each community. Subjects were classified as with normal weight (body mass index [BMI] &lt; 25 kg), overweight (BMI 25-29.9) and obesity (BMI &gt; or = 30 kg). RESULTS In 6,843 subjects -mean age (standard deviation): 71.9 (7.1) years-old; 53.3% women-, prevalence of obesity was 34.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33.3-35.5%), higher in women (38.4%; 95% CI, 36.8-39.9%) than in men (30.0%; 95% CI, 28.4-31.6%; p &lt; 0.001), with a tendency to decrease in the older population. In total, 81.7% of the population showed overweight (BMI &gt; or = 25). Prevalence differed among communities from 46.4% to 20.7% (p &lt; 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, obesity was inversely related to age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.98 per each year increment), and directly to female gender (OR = 1.25), rural (OR = 1.50) or semi-urban habitat (OR = 1.38), sedentary lifestyle (OR = 1.86) and non-smoking history (OR = 1.19). CONCLUSIONS Obesity was present in one out of 3 individuals of this reasonably representative sample of the Spanish population in an age range, 60 years-old or more, which concentrates a high cardiovascular risk. Differences in the prevalence among autonomus communities were detected.</dc:description>
