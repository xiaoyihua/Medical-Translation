<dc:description xml:lang="en">A descriptive and prospective study of 73 patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa, who were attended at the Provincial Center of Retinitis Pigmentosa, in Santiago de Cuba, from January to May, 1996, was conducted aimed at emphasizing the nurse's role in the application of ozonotherapy. There are different ways to administer this gast: autohemotherapy, intramuscular, artrectal insufflation. The information obtained was manually processed and percentage was used as a summary measure. The predominance of young and male patients is among the main results. Most of the patients were in stage II and III of the disease, and the rectal administration of ozone was the most used. This last aspect shows the significance of the nurse-patient relationship, which contributed decisively to the acceptance of rectal administration that was rejected by a great number of patients.</dc:description>
