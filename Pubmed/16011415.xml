<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To investigate the effect of the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor rofecoxib on the incidence of perianastomotic colonic tumors in a model of chemical carcinogenesis in the rat. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Experimental study with 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats randomly assigned to one of three groups: control (n = 15) with colocolic anastomosis and chemical carcinogenesis with 1-2 dimethylhydrazine (1-2 DMH); rofecoxib 0.0027% (n = 15) with colonic anastomosis, chemical carcinogenesis and the addition of dietary rofecoxib at doses of 27 parts per million (ppm), and rofecoxib 0.0058% (n = 15) with colonic anastomosis, chemical carcinogenesis and the addition of dietary rofecoxib at doses of 58 ppm. Carcinogenic induction was performed with 1-2 DMH at a weekly dose of 25 mg/kg of weight for 18 weeks, and colonic tumors induced were analyzed in postoperative week 20. The main parameter evaluated was the percentage of colonic neoplastic tissue, which relates tumor surface area to the colon's surface area. RESULTS Rofecoxib at doses of 2.5 mg/kg or 0.0058 ppm significantly reduced chemical colon carcinogenesis in rats, both in the perianastomotic area and the rest of the colon (p &lt; 0.01). In the extra-anastomotic area, rofecoxib at doses of 2.5 mg/kg has significantly greater inhibitory effect than rofecoxib in doses of 1.2 mg/kg or 0.0027 ppm (p &lt; 0.005). CONCLUSIONS Rofecoxib causes a reduction in chemical colon carcinogenesis in rats. This effect is sustained in the perianastomotic area, and the investigation of its role in operated colorectal cancer with risk of locoregional recurrence may therefore be of interest.</dc:description>
