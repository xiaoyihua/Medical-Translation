<dc:description xml:lang="en">The three lipoproteins of high (HDL) and very high density (VHDL-I and VHDL-II) were separated from the hemolymph of adult males of T. infestans. They were delipidated and the corresponding apolipoproteins examined by sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) gel electrophoresis in polyacrylamide in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. They were also iso-electro focused in a pH gradient of 5 to 8. All three groups of apolipoproteins were separated in several polypeptide chains, but all of them had in common a glycoproteic unit of PM 86 000. The VHDL-II presented the simplest composition with predominance of the 86 000 band. Apo-HDL was the most complicated and showed intense bands of PM as high as 210 000 and as low as 17 000 together with 44 000 and 86 000 and less intense bands. The apo-VHDL-I was separated in polypeptides chains in the range of 86 000 to 17 000. The different apoproteins are apparently formed by the association at least in part of common polypeptides.</dc:description>
