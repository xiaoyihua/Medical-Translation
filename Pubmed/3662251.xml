<dc:description xml:lang="en">Vaccine coverage, morbidity prevalence, and immunity to measles, rubella, and mumps, were estimated in 1985-1986 among a sample of 2 to 5 years old Galician children, studied through questionnaires and immunoenzymatic determinations of antibodies. According to the mothers, measles vaccine and measles-mumps-rubella vaccine were administered to 22.1% and 45.7%, respectively, of their children, whereas measles were reported in 17.9, mumps in 14.3%, and rubella in 2.9%. The seroconversion to rubella (50.7%) resulted significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than that to measles (75%) or mumps (68.6%). The three types of antibodies were found altogether in 32.1% of the subjects, and 5% of them showed none of these antibodies. The analysis of the serologic data stresses the need for reaching rapidly higher vaccination rates.</dc:description>
