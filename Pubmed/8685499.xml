<dc:description xml:lang="en">Results of the Spanish Registry for Hemodynamic and Interventional Cardiology are presented. As previous years, has been done by the Chapter of Hemodyamics and Interventional Cardiology of the Spanish Society of Cardiology. Seventy seven cardiac catheterization laboratories have collaborated, which represents 100% of those who had any activity in 1994. Sixty nine performed cardiac catheterization in adults, in 90% of the cases performing coronary intervention, and 22 performed both adult and pediatric studies. Eight laboratories exclusively performed pediatric cardiac catheterizations. Fifty five thousand one hundred sixty nine diagnostic procedures were performed, the majority of them being coronariographies (41,887), representing an increase of 10% from 1993. Ten thousand four hundred thirty three angioplasty procedures were performed in 1994. This represents 274 PTCA per million people (an increase of 21% compared to 1993). Eighty seven per cent of these procedures were done with conventional balloon, 1,361 stents were implanted (724 electivily), and 308 directional and 305 rotational atherectomies were performed. The overall results are similar to those of 1993, except for a marked reduction in complications of stents procedures (mainly in those implanted in a rescue situation). PTCA success was 91% with a complication rate of 3.4% and a mortality of 0.69%. The number of mitral valvuloplasties decreased 16% (694 vs 825 in 1993), and the pediatric interventional procedures were 7% less than those of 1993.</dc:description>
