<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The incidence of morbid obesity is increasing and gastric bypass is the most effective surgical treatment. AIM To assess the long term results of resection gastric bypass among morbidly obese patients aged less than 18 and over 65 years in terms of weight loss and correction comorbidities. MATERIAL AND METHODS From August 1999 to December 2006, 712 patients with morbid obesity were subjected to open resection gastric bypass. A group of 12 patients, aged less than 18 years and a second group of 8 patients aged more 65 years were selected to prospectively assess weight loss, complications and correction of associated comorbidities. RESULTS In the first group body mass index (BMI) decreased from 45+/-6.7 kg/m2 to 27.7+/-3.2 kg/m2, in a follow-up period of 22.9+/-8.4 months. All comorbidities disappeared or improved. A single patient (8.3%) had an incisional hernia. Among the second group, BMI decreased from 40.6+/-5.4 kg/m2 to 28.4+/-4.4 kg/m2, in a follow-up period of 26.6+/-15.9 months. All obesity comorbidities disappeared. Three patients (37.5%) presented incisional hernias. No patient died or had postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS In both groups resection gastric bypass was safe, obtained an appropriate weight loss and corrected all associated comorbidities to obesity.</dc:description>
