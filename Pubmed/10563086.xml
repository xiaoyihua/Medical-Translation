<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Although the potent antiviral effect of acyclovir on the Herpes-simplex (HSV) and Varicela-zoster (VZV) virus and the scarce effectiveness versus Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is known, some data suggest that it may have an immunodulator implicated in the control of these viral disease. The aim of this study was to characterize this possible effect of acyclovir versus the CMV antigen. METHODS We stimulated cultures of mononuclear cells obtained in 7 healthy patients who were seropositive for CMV and HSV with CMV antigen, HSV and with phitohemaglutinine (PHA). The proliferation index and culture cell phenotype were later determined in the absence and presence of acyclovir (2 micrograms/ml). In another group the proliferation index and cell phenotype following stimulation with the CMV antigen were studied prior to and after treating the same volunteers with acyclovir for one week (800 mg/6h). RESULTS The CMV antigen and HSV induced T cell proliferation predominantly involving the CD8+ subpopulation leading to an inversion of the CD4/CD8 quotient. On addition of acyclovir to the cell culture a moderate reduction was produced in lymphoproliferative response versus the CMV antigen and HVS, characteristically modulating CD8+ cell proliferation, thereby leading to reestablishment of the CD4/CD8 quotient. However, the proliferation induced by PHA was not inhibited. These results were produced on oral administration of acyclovir. CONCLUSIONS Acyclovir modulates the lymphoproliferative response induced by CMV antigen. Based on this observation, the authors hypothesize that this immunomodulation may be related to its preventive effect on CMV disease in transplanted patients.</dc:description>
