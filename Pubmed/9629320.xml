<dc:description xml:lang="en">The present review has the objective to identify clinical epidemiologic characteristics and evolution for four children with Fasciola hepatica evaluated at the Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit at the Children's Health Institute, Lima, Peru, between 1988 and 1992. The first patient was a 9-year old girl who had fever, leg edema, collateral circulation and hepatomegaly, predominantly at the right lobe. The second was a 6-year old by who had upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and fever; endoscopic diagnosis demonstrated hemobilia. The third case was a 12-year old boy who presented generalized edema. The fourth patient was a 9-year old boy with jaundice, fever and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Esophageal varices and cirrhosis were present. In the four patients the diagnosis was made by the identification of parasite eggs in the feces. The first three cases responded satisfactorily to treatment with bithionol; the fourth patient died because of systemic failure.</dc:description>
