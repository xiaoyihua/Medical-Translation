<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The beneficial effect of eicosapentaenoic acid in cancer patients is widely described especially in relation to its role in tumour cachexia. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of administration of a new oral powder supplement enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid compared to a standard liquid supplement in cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 61 cancer patients, aged more than 18 years, were randomized to receive during a month a bonus of 600 kcal/ day to their regular diet with an oral powder supplement enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (1.5 g) (RSI) or with a standard liquid supplement (RE). The following data were collected at baseline and after one month: the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (pg-SGA), anthropometric measurements (skin folds, circumferences and bioimpedance), dietary parameters (3-day food record), biochemical and inflammatory parameters (basic biochemistry, cytokines, prealbumin and Reactive C Protein). Quality of life was evaluated using the SF-36 questionnaire. At the end, scales were used to asses sensory perception, tolerance and satiety induced by the products and motivation to eat. RESULTS 40 patients completed the study. After intervention, anthropometric parameters do not change and prealbumin values increased significantly in both groups (RSI 16.11 ± 5.66 mg/dl vs. 19.81 ± 6.75 mg/dl p &lt; 0.05 and RE 6.13 ± 16.55 mg/dl vs. 19.03 ± 5.47 mg / dl p &lt; 0.05). RSI group significantly decreased interferon gamma (INF-γ) values (0.99 ± 0.95 vs. 0.65 ± 0.92 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, RE group increased INF-γ after intervention (1.62 ± 1 27 vs. 2.2 ± 3.19 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in hunger, appetite, satiety and intake capacity in both groups. The SF-36 scores improved in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Supplementation based on an oral powder formula enriched with 1.5 g EPA during one month in cancer patients improved certain inflammatory parameters. This product may be a novel and valuable option to be added to the nutritional intervention strategies used for cancer patients.</dc:description>
