<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Benign childhood paroxysmal eye deviation (BCPED) is classified as a 'non-epileptic paroxysmal disorder'. CASE REPORTS We report the cases of four patients aged between 6 months and 2 years, who suffered brief episodes of upward conjugate gaze deviation, with no clonic movements or associated cognitive deterioration. These episodes, which lasted several seconds, appeared in short repeated bouts that became worse with fatigue. Results of the neurological exploration, laboratory examinations, neuroimaging (CAT, MRI, brain ultrasonography) and a neurophysiological study, which included EEG-video monitoring and EEG performed during the waking state, were all normal. A nocturnal polysomnographic study was later conducted for 7-8 hours and EEG, EMG and EOG readings were recorded. The trace showed focal or generalised paroxysmal discharges during non-REM sleep in the form of polyspike-wave and spike-wave complexes. Sleep analysis (Reschstaffen and Kales) showed only a shortened REM sleep latency, with no clear clinical meaning. Several cases have been reported in the literature with identical symptoms and normal results in the diagnostic tests, including daytime polysomnography. CONCLUSIONS The appearance of these epileptic anomalies in the nocturnal study makes it necessary to perform a complete nocturnal polysomnography. In spite of these findings, BCPED courses favourably and has a benign prognosis both with and without antiepileptic treatment. We therefore believe that BCPED should be classed within the group of 'benign idiopathic epilepsies of childhood'.</dc:description>
