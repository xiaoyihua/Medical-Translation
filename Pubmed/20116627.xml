<dc:description xml:lang="en">The choice of antiretroviral treatment in comorbidities requires thorough knowledge of the interactions, pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of the drug to be used. Most drugs carry some risk in certain processes associated or not with HIV infection and drugs that can be used in these situations are of great interest. The development of etravirine, a new non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, will allow its use in these processes, with a lower risk of secondary effects and therefore of worsening the course of the disease and of treatment withdrawal. This is the case of patients coinfected with active hepatitis B and/or C virus and patients with a history of psychiatric disorders or receiving psychotropic drugs. The possible use of etravirine in women of fertile age is also of interest, due to the lower risk of teratogenicity if pregnancy occurs during treatment. Other collectives, such as patients with renal insufficiency or children and adolescents should not be forgotten; although these populations are less well studied, data are beginning to become available.</dc:description>
