<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to know the frequency and distribution of the histologic types of Hodgkin disease (HD) in the general Hospital of Mexico City and to compare the results with those of other countries; 96,909 surgical specimens were reviewed; 422 were of HD, from which only 309 (0.31%) could be reclassified according to the modified Rye classification, 214 (69%) were male and 95 (31%) female (M:F = 1:2.25). The mean age for the group was 26 years, for females was 30 and for males 24. The graphic for age and sex showed a unimodal curve in both sexes. The most frequent histologic type was mixed cellularity with 175 cases (56.6%), followed by the NE type with 83 (26.9%), the DL with 26 (8.4%) and finally the PL type with 25 (8.1%). In all the groups predominated the males as reported by other authors, but they reported a bimodal curve of age distribution and ours was unimodal as reported in Peru, Colombia, Uganda. The mean age is also one decade younger than in other countries, probably because almost 50% of the Mexican population are youngsters. The distribution of histologic types is similar to those of South Africa, Colombia, Uganda, Zambia and to the poor black population from USA, where the most frequent type is the mixed cellularity. The frequency of the other histologic types differs from the reports of Denmark Sweden, USA and England were the NE type predominates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
