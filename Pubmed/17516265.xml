<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To compare the safety and efficacy of topical plus subconjunctival versus retrobulbar anesthesia for primary non-penetrating sclerectomy supplemented with adjuntive 5-FU. METHODS A prospective study of 30 consecutive patients who were randomized to receive subconjunctival (n = 14) or retrobulbar (n = 16) anesthesia was performed. Operating conditions, patient comfort, postoperative pain, total pain and surgical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS There were no differences in the operating conditions. The retrobulbar group reported significantly more pain during administration of the anesthetic agent than the subconjunctival group (P= 0.00). The subconjunctival group reported more discomfort during surgery than the retrobulbar group (P= 0.00); however, this feature was not a problem for the surgeon. No statistically significant differences were found in regard to the total pain experienced, the postoperative pain, nor the success rates of the operative procedure in either group. CONCLUSION Topical/subconjunctival anesthesia is a safe and effective alternative to retrobulbar anesthesia for non penetrating sclerectomy supplemented with 5-FU.</dc:description>
