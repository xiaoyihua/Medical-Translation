<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and long term permeability of percutaneous biliary endoprostheses. Seventy three patients with biliary tract obstruction due to a primary malignant tumor (n = 60), lymph node metastases at the porta hepatis (n = 10) and benign stenosis of a biliary-enteric anastomosis (n = 3), were treated between 1985 and 1990. Plastic prostheses were installed in 63 patients and metallic in 10. The procedure had a 30% incidence of complications. Thirty three percent of the prostheses remained patent until patient's death. In 15 and 40% of patients, signs of prosthesis obstruction were observed three and six months after installation respectively, bearing in mind a mean survival of 24 weeks. In 90% of patients there was a clinical and laboratory improvement. Mortality was 30% at 30 days in the group of patients with malignant diseases. It is concluded that the installation of percutaneous biliary endoprostheses is a relatively safe and well tolerated procedure, with a low incidence of complications or mortality and that allows an effective biliary decompression.</dc:description>
