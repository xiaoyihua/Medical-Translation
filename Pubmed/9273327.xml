<dc:description xml:lang="en">At this study we analyzed morphologic relation with vaginal ephitelium, in women with bacterial vaginosis, in pre-treatment; first post-treatment and second post-treatment using metronidazol (oral), and clindamycine (intra-vaginally). From 20 patients with bacterial vaginosis, 10 received oral metronidazol, 500 mg/b.i.d. during seven days; the other patients received, clindamycine 2% intravaginal, once a day, during seven days. Couples received metronidazol. In pre-treatment, cellular prolongations produced greater adhesion of bacteria, and rests of cellular unions with adhered bacteria. There was penetration of some bacteria to epithelial cells, confirming this with serial cuts and discarding superposition in the cells. This penetration was found in five cases y persisted during the first and second post-treatment. In the first post-treatment, cellular groups without bacteria, were found. The presence of lactobacillus was low, increasing afterwards. The presence of yeasts was in the first post-treatment, and in some cases persisted. It is important to differentiate intracellular bacteria and to know the related characteristics with bacterial penetration, for an adequate prescription and a better use of medication, avoiding possible damage. The presence of bacteria may be one of the causes for bacterial vaginosis reincidence.</dc:description>
