<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The high prevalence of betathalassemia minor and the presence of several cases of thalassemia major in Menorca (Spain) led us, ten years ago, to set up a population based prevention campaign, following the basic schedule of those already taking place in other areas, specially in Italy. PATIENTS AND METHODS The target population was the children in the last year of mandatory school, when they are 13 to 14 years old. The campaign started in the school year 1986-1987 and in the 1995-1996 course we reached the tenth yearly campaign. The campaign was structured in three stages: the first one included all information and educational aspects; the second step corresponded to blood sampling and detection of carriers; finally, results were reported to the individuals and genetic counseling was given. For evaluation purposes, we have monitored participation rates, the proportion of detected carriers which present to haematology visit and the trend in the proportion of carriers which previously knew their status. RESULTS A total of 8,591 children were screened, accounting for a 83.8% participation rate. The observed prevalence was 26.7/1000 (95% CI, 23.5-29.9/1000). We also detected 9 cases of alfathalassemia and 4 cases of deltabetathalassemia. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that participation rates may be reached through school screening campaigns for thalassemia. After ten years of campaign, the number of not previously known cases has become small, indicating that the campaign screening to relatives of detected carriers and a higher consciousness level in the general population have given the expected effect. In the last 14 years, not a single homozigote case has been born, although we cannot conclude that this has been only due to the campaign.</dc:description>
