<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyse the reliability and validity of a scale of social evaluation of the elderly. DESIGN Descriptive, cross-sectional study. SETTING Primary care. PATIENTS Sample of 1062 people from the over-65 population. INTERVENTIONS The scale evaluated has five items (family situation, economic situation, housing, relationships and social support), and an overall score is obtained. Its reliability was evaluated by an interview with two observers, and validity by contrasting the score obtained on the scale with a reference criterion of an independent, blind assessment by a social work expert. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The intraclass correlation coefficient (inter-observer reliability) was 0.957. The Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0.4467, which denoted moderate to low internal consistency. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the validity of the criterion. Nevertheless, to detect social problems in care practice, probability proportions for different levels on the scale were more useful. These ranged from 1 to 23, while in the detection of social risk they ranged from 1 to infinity. CONCLUSIONS The scale studied by us as a measuring instrument enables risk situations and social problems to be detected with good reliability and acceptable validity. It should be introduced into the care practice of professionals working in the social or health care of the elderly.</dc:description>
