<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Prevalence of allergic diseases has been increased in last years; new alternative therapies have been employed. Beneficial effects of probiotics have been described in some pathologies such as tumors, diarrhea, and allergic disease. The aim of our work was to describe nutritional status and influence of probiotic consumption in allergic population. PATIENTS AND METHODS 44 allergic patients were selected, in all patients were recorded; sex, age, place of residence, anthropometric evaluation, dietary questionnaire and allergic variables (rush, blood levels of Ig E, and number of crisis in a year). RESULTS 18 patients (40.9%) were females and 26 (59.1%) males with an average age of 24.5 (10.3) years. Most of patients (20.5%) are located in percentile P25-50, showing a good nutritional status. 16 patients consumed probiotics (27.1%), with an average of consumption per week 1.79 (3.16) and an average amount per week (mg-ml) (593.4 (461.9). The number of crisis year was 1.44 (1.8), average value of Ig E was 35.68 (31.93) UI/L and rush 10.09 (2.8) mm. Patients with a consumption of probiotics higher than 593 mg/week showed a IOW rush diameter (10.12(0.8) mm vs 8.85 (1.1) mm; p &lt; 0.05), without statistical differences in other variables. CONCLUSION Consumption of probiotics in allergic patients could be beneficial. Further studies with more patients and intervention designs will be necessary to analyze this relations.</dc:description>
