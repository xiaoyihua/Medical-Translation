<dc:description xml:lang="en">Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by a decrease in bone mineral density which results in an increase in bone fracture. Its etiology is still unknown. Several risks factors have been described: increase in coffee intake, decrease in calcium intake, a sedentary lifestyle, a decrease in estrogen secretion and genetic factors. It has been recently shown that mood disorders, such as Major Depression associated with high levels of cortisone, constitute a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis. Psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology considers an integrated human being, a biopsychosocial unit permanently related to his environment, overcoming the cause - effect relationship. Taking into account this point of view we studied the psychoaffective and psychodynamic aspects in patients with osteoporosis. Several disorders have been found, an increase in anxiety indexes, depression, alexithymia, a larger number of early traumatic life events, a decrease in the support network and lower quality of life. Consequently, this pathology should be dealt with within an interdisciplinary framework. It is equally important to detect osteoporosis at an early stage in patients showing mood disorders.</dc:description>
