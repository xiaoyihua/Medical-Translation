<dc:description xml:lang="en">A supplementary meal based on locally produced (North West, Argentina) cereals and legumes was developed. The meal composition was as follows:extruded corn/soy (70:30) enzimatically modified; sugar; soy protein concentrate and additives. This preparation was characterized as an intermediate moisture content meal. Its adequate water content (35%) provides some plastic behaviour. Due to its low water activity (0.823) the formulation does not demand special requirements either for packing or storage. This meal provides high caloric density (3.06 Kcal/g) with a proper calories:nitrogen ratio (234). The protein quality was evaluated through the Relative Net Protein Ratio Method (R.N.P.R.) giving a result of 83.5%. The evaluation of its nutritional properties, as well as its stability and acceptability features, suggest that this product is appropriate for being included in food assistance programs.</dc:description>
