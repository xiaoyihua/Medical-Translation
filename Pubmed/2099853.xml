<dc:description xml:lang="en">We prospectively evaluated 61 episodes of bacteremia in 54 patients with hepatic cirrhosis, representing 9% of the overall number of bacteremic episodes in adult patients seen in our center during the study period. Spontaneous bacteremia represented 46% of all episodes (virtually always in patients with ascites), followed by the urinary origin (30%). Gram negative organisms were isolated in 71% of episodes. 43% of these were hospital-acquired 25% of patients had spontaneous peritonitis. Among other complications of bacteremia there were shock (28%), renal failure (24%), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (6%). The mortality rate due to sepsis was 28%, that due to complications of cirrhosis by itself was 20%, and that of nonrelated diseases was 8%. Shock and renal failure secondary to bacteremia were independent predictors of a poor prognosis.</dc:description>
