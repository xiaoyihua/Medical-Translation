<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To call attention to the visual sharpness disorders which pre-school children on a determined paediatric list present. DESIGN A descriptive study. SETTING Riaño Health Centre, Langreo, Asturias. PARTICIPANTS Pre-school children aged 4 and 5 at the study date (1994). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 155 children captured for the study through the nursing child programme were evaluated. Data were collected from their corresponding clinical histories. Evaluation was performed by Paediatrics and Ophthalmology specialists and second-year interns in Family and Community Medicine at the Valle del Nalón hospital. To check ocular alignment, the Hirschberg test was used; and to explore visual sharpness, the Pigassou optotype was applied. Disturbance of ocular alignment was suspected in 40.6% of cases and pathology was confirmed in 58.3%; whereas in 44% of cases referral to the ophthalmologist was due to errors in the visualisation of the optotype, with 50% presenting pathology. Amblyopia was found in 5.4% of the total population studied. In the breakdown of ophthalmic pathology it was observed that compound astigmatism was the most common finding (25%). CONCLUSIONS 1. The high prevalence of Amblyopia found underlines the importance of considering it as a priority objective in prevention programmes. 2. The Hirschberg test and early use of optotypes should be considered elementary routine exploration tests in the scheduled check-ups. 3. It would be useful to strengthen training within the population as a whole as well as improve the linking of Primary and Specialist Care.</dc:description>
