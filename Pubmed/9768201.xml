<dc:description xml:lang="en">One thousand two hundred sixteen people living in 6 representative municipalities in Havana City were surveyed in order to know what they knew about leprosy and how these patients are perceived by them. The purpose was to ascertain if the community was prepared to help them to their adaptation to a socially useful life, which is one of the tenets of the Program for the Control of this disease. It was proved that only 10% had the necessary knowledge about leprosy and the remaining 90% had wrong notions about it. It is concluded that the community is not prepared for bringing about a change in the present status of this condition.</dc:description>
