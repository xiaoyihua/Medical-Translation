<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study describes a popular educational process conducted in two communities in Jalisco, Mexico. The purpose was to add an alfalfa concentrate to the population's diet as an alternative, locally available food source. Previous studies had shown that alfalfa contains high protein, vitamin, and essential amino acid levels and can be useful to supplement and improve child nutrition. This resource had not been used previously due to lack of knowledge concerning its properties and harvesting and processing procedures and because it had traditionally been used as livestock feed. The current study included four steps: 1) community knowledge, 2) a community survey using interviews, home visits, and child nutrition evaluation, 3) formation of work groups in a community meeting, and 4) an educational program, working with a self-diagnostic tool taking child nutritional status into account. Our work focused on two areas simultaneously: family nutrition and the alfalfa concentrate as a way to improve it. Although this process was lengthy, it resulted in the acceptance and inclusion of alfalfa concentrate. In addition, the community groups formed in the process remain as an ongoing organizational resource.</dc:description>
