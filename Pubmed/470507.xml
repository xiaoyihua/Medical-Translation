<dc:description xml:lang="en">Phantom tumors are accumulations of pleural effusion in the interlobular spaces of the lungs. They appear in patients with heart failure simulating a lung tumor but disappearing with medical treatment. The encystment of the fluid is apparently due to congenital defects in the pleura, which tends to store up the transudate produced by heart failure. Another pathogenetic possibility is the existence of pleural adherences. The most common localization is in the minor cissure, perhaps because it is more easily identified in the posterior view of the chest X-ray. In most of these cases the pleural effusion is due to left heart failure, though pleural effusion in normally associated with right congestive heart failure. On the posterior chest X-ray the fluid is observed as a round or fusiform mass. Differential diagnosis should be established for measotheliomas, pulmonary infarctions, pulmonary or metastatic tumoral nodules, hydatic cysts, and tuberculomas. Sixteen cases of phantom tumors are reported; nine of them were localized on the minor cissure, five on the right major cissure, one on the left major cissure, and one case of double localization on the left major cissure and minor cissure. All of them were due to left congestive heart failure.</dc:description>
