<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) has become an important alternative for the treatment of kidney stones due to its increased safety and efficiency. The purpose of this study is to compare efficacy and safety features of RIRS against percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) for the treatment of 2 - 3.5 cm kidney stones. METHODS 142 cases (106 RIRS and 36 PCNL) encompassing 2 - 3.5 cm kidney stones that have been treated in our center between December 2009 and December 2011 have been considered. Demographic variables, stone characteristics, surgical stay and surgical time have been evaluated. Additionally, the complication prerate and success rate after one and two procedures (retreatment) have also been assessed. Student's T, Mann-Whitney U y Chi² - V Cramer (p=0.05) tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS There are not statistically significant differences in demographic or stone variables. The calculated mean surgical time was lower for PCNL (85 min) than for RIRS (112 min). Mean hospital stay was statistically significantly shorter in RIRS (16 h vs. 98 h in RIRS, p=0.001). PCNL exhibited a higher global complication rate of 19.4% vs. 6.6% for RIRS (p=0.001). PCNL also showed a higher successful rate (80.6% vs. 73.6% for RIRS), although this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.40). When comparing the success rate after a second procedure, PCNL results in 94.3% vs. 93.5% for RIRS (p=0.88). CONCLUSION RIRS was found to be a safe and efficient procedure with a short hospital stay. Overall, RIRS can be considered as an alternative to PCNL for the treatment of renal stones smaller than 3.5 cm.</dc:description>
