<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES To present our experience with Hydroflex and Dynaflex self-contained inflatable penile prosthesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between october 1988 and december 2000 a total of 63 men underwent implantation of 8 Hydroflex and 55 Dynaflex penile prosthesis. The follow-up period ranged from 12 and 127 months (mean 54.5). RESULTS A total of 124 cylinders were implanted (in 2 cases only 1 cylinder was implanted). During implantation 3 corpora cavernosun ruptures were present, but implantation was possible in 2. Specific complication rates after implantation were as follow: early infection, 3 patients (4.7%); late infection, 1 patient (1.6%); pain that needed readmission 2 cases (3.2%); mechanical device failure, 7 cylinders in 6 men (mean time 83.5 months). 7 men (11.1%) needed prolonged teaching time to operate the prosthesis. Only 6 men (9.5%) wer dissatisfied with the prosthesis. It was possible to change only 1 cylinder when needed. CONCLUSIONS Self-contained inflatable prosthesis brings good results on long time use. The mechanical malfunction rate is low and it is possible to change only one cylinder if needed. An important number of patients need intensive and prolonged teaching time to obtain a successful result.</dc:description>
