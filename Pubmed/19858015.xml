<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED Intraperitoneal bleeding is common in patients with abdominal trauma or in those with benign gynecologic diseases, but it is very rare to occur spontaneously. The purpose of this communication is to report a female patient with idiopathic spontaneous hemoperitoneum (ISH). CASE PRESENTATION A 28-year-old patient was admitted with 12-hour acute abdominal pain. Laboratory tests upon admission showed: Hb 9.0 g/dL, WBC 8.9 x 109/dL and negative immunologic pregnancy test. The ultrasound showed free intraperitoneal fluid. She underwent exploratory laparoscopy with findings of massive hemoperitoneum, which was resolved and, after a thorough exploration of the abdominal cavity, no evidence of the bleeding site was found. She was closely followed-up for 2 years without any recurrence or complications related to the ISH. An extensive review of the literature was performed. We conclude that ISH is a rare entity that usually presents as a surgical emergency and whose diagnosis is made in the absence of predisposing factors and excluding lesions in the abdominal blood vessels and organs. It warrants immediate intervention, which is crucial for patient survival.</dc:description>
