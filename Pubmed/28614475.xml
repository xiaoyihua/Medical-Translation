<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective Analyze strategies implemented by Ecuador's Ministry of Public Health (MPH) to position the country in the global health agenda during the period 2011-2015 as a result of health sector reform. Method Documentary review and interviews with stakeholders in national and international agencies with respect to positioning in the global health sphere during the study period. Results It was observed that the reform process produced a new framework to manage international health relations. The MPH implemented strategies and mechanisms to place national health priorities and interests on the global health agenda at bilateral, regional, and global levels. As a result, the country took a leadership role in certain processes and attained recognition at various international forums. Conclusions The MPH reform process contributed to recognition and establishment of Ecuador's public policy priorities in the global health agenda through strategies such as giving importance to putting national priorities on the global health agenda, guiding the global health approach exercised by the highest health authority, developing technical capabilities and skills in the International Relations Office, and raising awareness in technical bodies.</dc:description>
