<dc:description xml:lang="en">HIV and HTLV-1 are retrovirus that can produce human disease. It is known that HTLV-1 is associated to the adult T cell leukemia and to the spastic tropical paraparesis. AIDS is now a pandemic infection and HTLV-1 has a high endemicity in the Caribbean region and Japan, whereas the south of the United States has a low endemicity. In Mexico there is little information on HTLV-1 incidence. In the present work we looked for anti HTLV-1 antibodies in one hundred persons that belong to the high risks AIDS population in the city of Monterrey, Mexico. We found that 93 sera were positive for anti HIV antibodies in a ELISA test and seven were negative. All 93 sera were also positive in the Western Blot assay. In the confirmatory test two out of the seven negative sera were classified as indeterminate and five as negative. We also included in this study 50 sera from healthy control volunteers that did not belong to the high risk AIDS population and resulted negative in the HIV and HTLV-1 test. Anti HTLV-1 antibodies were determined by using an agglutination test with gelatin particles covered with HTLV-1 and confirmed by a Western Blot assay. We found that only three sera resulted positive in this agglutination test, but were negative by the Western Blot technique.</dc:description>
