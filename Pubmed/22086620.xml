<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To estimate the cost-utility of the vaccine against the Human Papiloma Virus (HPV) in peruvian women after the application of the vaccine at 10 years of age. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cost-utility analysis was performed using the Markov´s hidden model in a hypothetical cohort of peruvian women, based on the information on epidemiological parameters, costs associated to uterine cervical cancer (UCC) and the efficacy and costs of the vaccine against the HPV. The vaccination costs were estimated from the Peruvian Ministry of Health perspective and were compared against the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), using a discount rate of 5%. RESULTS The annual cost of the vaccination was USD 16,861,490, for the Papanicoau screening it was USD 3,060,793 and the costs associated to the UCC were USD 15,580,000. The incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) was 6,775 USD/QALY. CONCLUSIONS Vaccination against HPV can be cost-utility compared to not vaccinating.</dc:description>
