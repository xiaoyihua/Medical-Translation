<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE We carried out this study in patients who underwent resection of carotid body tumour (CBT). Shamblin's classification system was used as well as the modified Shamblin classification. We sought to determine whether surgical time and bleeding could be reduced with the use of the LigaSure system. METHODS A prospective study was carried out in patients with CBT. RESULTS A decrease in both time and bleeding was shown, although only overall time showed statistical significance. Cases were classified as Shamblin I, II and III in two, six, and four cases, respectively, and after surgical treatment were classified as modified Shamblin I, II, IIIa and IIIb in two, one, and six cases, respectively, by infiltration to the carotid. There was nerve damage in four cases, and there were three carotid resections. CONCLUSIONS Use of LigaSure decreased bleeding and surgical time in CBTs. Lesions of the artery are mainly caused by infiltration or by muscular hypotrophy of the artery, which frequently requires vascular reconstruction. Nerve injury continues to be an important postoperative complication, which may result in a reduction in the quality of life for the patient. The rates of nerve injury as a result of surgery were unchanged.</dc:description>
