<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND There are conflicting results in the literature regarding the impact of duodenal diverticula on the technical success and complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). AIM To evaluate if the presence of periampullary duodenal diverticulum increases the risk of failure of ampulla cannulation. METHODS Patients who underwent ERCP between January 2008 and December 2009 were evaluated. They were divided in group A (without duodenal diverticulum) or group B (with duodenal diverticulum). Gender, age, endoscopic and radiological diagnosis, difficulty to cannulate, endoscopic sphincterotomy, precut technique, therapeutic procedure and complications were documented. RESULTS 1159 patients were included: 1100 in group A and 59 in group B. A successful cannulation was obtained in 1061 patients of group A and 53 of group B (96.46 vs. 89.83%, p &lt; 0.0001, OR 0.03). The failure of cannulation was observed in 39 patients of group A and 6 of group B (3.54 vs. 10.17%, p= 0.021, OR 2.94). The presence of intradiverticular papilla was the cause of failure in all cases. The therapeutic procedures showed statistical differences in choledocholithiasis clearance as well as endoscopic sphincterotomy and biliary stents insertion, but there was no significant difference in complications. We found statistical significant differences in biliary lithiasis, malignant stenosis, mechanical lithotripsy and insertion of biliary stents. CONCLUSIONS Periampullary duodenal diverticula increase the risk of failure for cannulation of ampulla. However, it should not be considered as contraindication for ERCP.</dc:description>
