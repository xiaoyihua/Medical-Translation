<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The self-determination of blood glucose is relevant for diabetes mellitus (DM) insulin-treated patients. The use of glucometers with advanced features and measuring glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) may help improve metabolic control. The main objective of this study was to determine the percentage of insulin treated patients who reduced HbA1c by at least 0.4% after 6 months of using Contour and A1CNow+. MATERIALS AND METHODS Observational, prospective, multicentre study in adult DM insulin treated patients, with HbA1c&gt; 8%. RESULTS Of the 454 recruited patients analysed, a total of 333 were evaluable. After 6 months the HbA1c decreased (P&lt;.05) in both groups [-0.89 (95% CI -1.01 to -0.76) and -0.98 (95% CI: -1.21 to -0.76), in type 1 and 2 DM, respectively]. An HbA1c reduction of 0.4% was observed in 73% of patients after 6 months of device use. A decrease in the number of patients with HbA1c &gt; 8% was observed, with this reaching: 41% for all, 45% in type 1 DM, and 25% in type 2 DM. In the glycaemic profile, a reduction (P&lt;.05) was observed in pre- and post-prandial glycaemia in both groups (-20.7±36.4 and -37.1±47.1mg/dL, respectively), with 23% pre-prandial glucose &lt; 130mg/dL and post-prandial &lt; 180mg/dL CONCLUSION: The use of glucometers with advanced features, and measuring glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) may help improve metabolic control and to monitor insulin treated DM patients more closely.</dc:description>
