<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The platelet-rich plasma involves a concentration of platelet in a limited volume of plasma. It is used in several tissue regeneration surgical procedures where the growth factor platelet regeneration improves wounds healing. OBJECTIVE Describe the treatment effects with platelet-rich plasma in chronic wounds. METHOD Prospective longitudinal study of a series of cases with chronic wounds admitted to the Home Care Unit of the Hospital General Universitario de Alicante. Inclusion criteria were: 1) patients with no infected wounds of any etiology at the time of treatment; 2) informed consent by the patient; 3) monitoring viability. TECHNIQUE An extraction of 20 ml of blood was realized. After double centrifugation, the plasma was extracted and the platelets were activated with Calcium chloride. Then we proceeded to the infiltration in the edges and inside the wounds, applying the remaining on the surface. Serial photographs of the injuries were taken, recording their characteristics. As evident improvement criterion was chosen the full certificate of discharge of monitoring of the patient, or controlled by primary attention. RESULTS The four treated patients showed a clearly satisfactory evolution, checking clinically a clear improvement of processes with an accelerated healing. Only one of the patients showed an erythema around the injury that resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSION The infiltration of chronic wounds with platelet-rich plasma has been shown as an effective treatment.</dc:description>
