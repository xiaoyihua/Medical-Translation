<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND sialorrhea is one of the common nonmotor, non-neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease and its pre-sence can cause limitation in the patient's social life. The traditional treatment with anticholinergic medication is capable of triggering important neuropsychiatric complications. OBJECTIVES this is a prospective, double-blind, placebo compared study, which follow-up Parkinson's disease patients for 3 months. METHODS we measured the efficacy of clonidine in the management of sialorrhea. The study was performed in 32 patients (20 males and 12 females), with a mean age of 70.75 years and mean duration of the disease of 8.84 years. Randomly, 17 patients received clonidine 0.15 mg/day and the remaining 15 patients received placebo. Both groups were made up of subjects with similar characteristics, age, years of illness, sex, stage of disease (H and Y), disability (S and C) and motor score (UPDRS). Likewise, salivation affected both groups in the same intensity. We used the variable analysis and there was a p &lt; 0.05 significance. RESULTS the group which received clonidine showed a significant improvement of the salivation symptoms both at one month as well as at 3 months of treatment (p &lt; 0.00001, respectively). There was no evidence of worsening of the stage of the disease, incapacity or motor score. The side effects were found only in the group that received clonidine (4 patients) without showing statistically significant. CONCLUSION the use of clonidine can be useful in the management and treatment of sialorrhea in patients with Parkinsońs disease.</dc:description>
