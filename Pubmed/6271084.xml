<dc:description xml:lang="en">Polysomes were isolated from calcified and matrix-containing tissues, such as rat calvaria, rat chondrosarcoma and chick embryos. The method of isolation involves preliminary swelling of the tissues in hypotonic buffer containing heparin and cycloheximide. After homogenization, differential centrifugation is used to separate membrane-bound and non-bound polysomes. Each fraction is rehomogenized in the presence of detergent (Triton X-100) and potassium ions (0.25M). Polysomes are harvested by centrifugation through sucrose cushions in the continued presence of high levels of potassium ions and heparin. Total, non-bound, and membrane-bound polysomes prepared in this manner are equally active in protein synthesizing activity in an heterologous cell-free system. The distribution between non-bound and membrane-bound polysomes in the 12 day old chick embryo is 43 and 57 per cent respectively. Sucrose gradient profiles of polypeptide chains on polysomes labeled in organ culture correlate well with the protein synthetic activity of the isolated polysomes. Much of the protein synthetic activity is devoted to collagen. Polysomal fractions obtained from sucrose gradients show preferential incorporation of 3H-proline and nearly 60 per cent of trichloroacetic acid precipitable material is susceptible to collagenase digestion. Products of synthesis are also substrates for collagen specific enzyme, prolyl hydroxylase. The method described in this communication overcomes the inherent difficulties in obtaining active polysomes from calcified and matrix-containing tissues.</dc:description>
