<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To carry out, by means of a literature review, an update of the entities that can be included within the group of benign partial epilepsies of childhood. DEVELOPMENT Among partial epilepsies with onset in the first stages of life, a group extended in the last years with a favourable course and a trend to reverse, even spontaneously, has been identified. Some of these entities have a genetic origin but we do not know the mechanisms by which these epilepsies show a self limited course, which have given rise to the denomination of epilepsy that comes and goes; nevertheless, an evolution to other more complex forms is also possible. CONCLUSIONS Benign partial epilepsies of childhood constitute a wide group of conditions of varied semiology, usually with a good prognosis even without treatment. Occasionally, these epilepsies may show a more unfavourable course with a worsening, in spite of medication, and the appearance of neurologic and neuropsychologic disorders. All these aspects must be known and considered by the physician in charge of these patients management.</dc:description>
