<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ribbing disease is a rare benign sclerosing bone dysplasia. It presents with an increased bone density at the diaphysis with cortical endosteal/periosteal thickening and affects predominantly the lower extremities. We report a case of a 28 year-old woman with a this condition in her tibia that occluded the medullary cavity, with severe pain that could not be relieved with anti-inflammatory therapy. Several cases have been published on pain relief after intramedullary reaming. We performed this treatment with the surgical steps to avoid complications such as a fracture or false route that may occur due to the difficulty in piercing the closed medullary cavity. Pain improved immediately after surgery, and the patient is asymptomatic after one year. The natural progression of ribbing disease is to stabilise, but there are no data published with long term follow-up after intramedullary reaming.</dc:description>
