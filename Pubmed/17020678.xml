<dc:description xml:lang="en">We describe the case of a patient with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who showed a progressive increase in aminotransferase level, reaching values of aspartate aminotransferase 1723 UI/L, alanine aminotransferase 1519 UI/L and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase 296 with a bilirubin level of 6 mg/dL and direct bilirubin level of 4.6 mg/dL. One year previously, the patient had been diagnosed with CHC, genotype 1, and had an initial hepatitis C virus RNA load of 249,000 UI/mL. All the specific blood tests performed were negative except for antisoluble liver antigen (anti-SLA) antibodies, which were positive in two different determinations. A diagnosis of overlap syndrome CHC and autoimmune hepatitis was made. Steroid and azathioprine treatment was started with good response. The relationship between CHC and anti-SLA is not well characterized but has been described in these patients. We found no prior reports in the literature of CHC associated with positive anti-SLA in a patient with persistent acute hepatitis.</dc:description>
