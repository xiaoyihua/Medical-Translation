<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE Our experience en treatment of gastroschisis using a protocol with elective preterm delivery by caesarean section at 34-35 weeks and immediate primary abdominal wall closure. METHODS During a period of 18 month we treated 5 patients with gastroschisis using the following management pathway: Starting at 30th week of gestation, weekly ultrasound evaluation of fetal gut and pulmonary maturation with corticosteroids. Delivery by elective caesarean section between 34-35 weeks or earlier if evidence of bowel compromise was reported en ultrasound study. Immediate surgical correction after birth with primary closure was preformed under control of abdominal pressure. RESULTS Mean gestational age of our patient was 33,94 weeks, and mean birth weight was 2154 gr. None of the cases present inflammatory peel and we found no difficulties for reduction of the gut at time of surgery. Two patients presented an intestinal malrotation. Extubation was preformed 36-48 hours after surgery. We started a trofic diet at 3,6 days and parental nutrition was retired after a mean period of 15,8 days. The mean time of hospital stay was 33,4 days. One patient with intestinal obstruction had a consideriously increased length of hospital stay of 74 days. CONCLUSIONS A management pathway for gastroschisis with selective preterm delivery by caesarean section and immediate surgical treatment probably reduces the experience of inflammatory peel. This pathway permits a early initiation of oral feeding, reduces times of parenteral nutrition and need of central catheters, and shortens length of hospital stay.</dc:description>
