<dc:description xml:lang="en">Modern recombinant biotechnology has made possible the production of large amount of interferons and their use as immunotherapeutic agents. Most of the biological, physical and chemical characteristics of interferons has been established, including their classification, genetic structure, chemical composition and possible mechanisms of action. Interferons have been utilized in clinical studies with human and experimental animals against bacterial, mycotic, parasitic and viral infections. Success has been reported mainly when administered prophylactically against acute infections. Favorable results have been obtained, both prophylactic and therapeutically, in some chronic diseases and in those in which the microorganism has an intracellular phase during its life cycle. Moreover, a promising future has been suggested for the combined use of interferon with other antimicrobial drugs.</dc:description>
