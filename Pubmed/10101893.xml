<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report two cases of urethral foreign body. Although this condition is not uncommon, few cases are reported in the literature. METHODS/RESULTS Two cases of urethral foreign body are described: a 74-year-old male with mental disorder who presented with acute urinary retention arising from a fragment of a metal tube in the bulbous urethra and a 34-year-old female with intense micturition syndrome arising from a calcified electrical cable located in the urethra. Both patients required open surgery for foreign body removal. CONCLUSIONS A wide variety of urethral foreign body has been described in the literature. In adults this is commonly caused by the insertion of objects used for masturbation and is frequently associated with mental disorder as in the two cases described herein.</dc:description>
