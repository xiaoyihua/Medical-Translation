<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To study the epidemiological behaviour of pulmonary diseases with ventilation disorder to assess their development within primary care. DESIGN Prospective study. SETTING Primary care. Tudela West Health Centre (Navarra). PARTICIPANTS 166 patients with one of the classic patterns of disorder found by Spirometry were chosen and monitored for a year. RESULTS 72.3% were male with an average age of 63.2. 7.8% were new cases. 62.0% were smokers/ex-smokers. 80.1% had another associated pathology. An overall decrease in ventilatory function values was noted: this was more pronounced in cases of recurrence. 2.08 medicines were used, with smaller FEV1 [correction of FVE1]-fraction of ventricular ejection-leading to more medicines, of which the beta-adrenergics were the most common. 25.3% showed poor therapeutic compliance, deteriorating with age. 55% used inhalers badly. The number of medicines increased with decompensation. There were on average 3.5 consultations per year at the health centre. CONCLUSIONS Tudela's findings are similar to those in other areas. There is poor therapeutic compliance among people of geriatric age. The burden of control falls on primary care.</dc:description>
