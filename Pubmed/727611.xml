<dc:description xml:lang="en">Authors report two cases of internal hernia through Treves avascular field defects, at the ileal level and another case in which this mesenteric mishape was incidentally found during operation for intestinal obstruction due to adhesions. In this particular case it can be speculated that the defect could have been the cause of a former neonatal obstruction for which operation did not offer an explanation. This type of internal hernia is one of the rarest in pediatric surgical practice. The clinical picture is that of an intestinal strangulation and therefore diagnosis can hardly be made preoperatively. The ileal terminal location of the strangulated loop can, in their opinion, justify a resection extending to the caecum in order to avoid vascular risks on the anastomosis in spite of the sacrifice of the ileo-cecal valve. The three patients survived. Literature on this topic is briefly reviewed.</dc:description>
