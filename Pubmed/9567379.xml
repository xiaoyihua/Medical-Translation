<dc:description xml:lang="en">Revista Médica de Chile, official journal of Sociedad Médica de Santiago, was founded in 1872 and has appeared uninterruptedly until today. Its aim, since its creation, has been the diffusion of scientific knowledge of Chilean physicians through original contributions, medical review articles and information about foreign medical literature. During the first 50 years of existence, physicians of medical and surgical specialties collaborated with articles, butafterwards, its main interest was oriented towards internal medicine. Its preoccupation for public health has been constant. Between 1930 and 1950, the interest in internists to divulge national clinical investigation gave a great impulse to this journal. Two important design modifications in 1958 and 1973 allowed the magnification of its information range. The incorporation of peer review of manuscripts in 1973 was an important achievement. Since its foundation, Revista Médica de Chile has been the principal written source of postgraduate training in our country.</dc:description>
