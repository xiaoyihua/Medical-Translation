<dc:description xml:lang="en">The effect of humidification of the environment was studied on the frequency and severeness of spistaxes in a group of 16 children. A control group was composed of 18 children with the idea that they were similar, but the hematologic conditions of the latter group were more unfavorable. A decrease of epistaxis was not found; there was a minimal prolongation of the days between one and the next nosebleeding picture. A definite decrease in the severeness of bleeding was found in the second group as judged by a lesser necessity of transfusions.</dc:description>
