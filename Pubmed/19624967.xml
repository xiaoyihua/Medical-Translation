<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Kawasaki disease (EK) is frequently identified in pediatric patients. It affects principally the coronary arteries, causing aneurysms, ischemic heart disease and sudden death. The opportune diagnosis and its early treatment avoid these complications. Our objective was to describe 17 cases with EK. CLINICAL CASES seventeen patients' files with EK were reviewed, obtaining information about age, sex, date of admission, clinical manifestations, laboratory results, complications and treatment. RESULTS four patients presented coronary aneurysm. The average age was 37 months, with a range from 15 months to 11 years. There was a predominance of males, with relation 2.4 to 1. CONCLUSIONS the EK was not considerated initially; on post-mortem studies, affected coronary arteries were demonstrated. The EK treatment is intravenous gamma-globulin and aspirin and it must be established before the tenth day after the fever begins in order to avoid cardiac complications. Four cases developed AC remitted after 16 months. The EK diagnosis is predominantly clinical.</dc:description>
