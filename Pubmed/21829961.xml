<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Identify simple clinical elements that can be used to adequately determine the cases with the highest probability of presenting bacterial isolates in blood cultures. METHODS Case-control study with patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia from 1998-2009. Patients with positive blood cultures were defined as cases, and patients with negative blood cultures were defined as controls. The demographic and clinical variables were recorded and a bivariate analysis was conducted. The variables with statistically significant differences between the groups were introduced in a logistic regression model in order to define the independent predictors and generate a clinical prediction model. RESULTS A total of 15.2% of the 322 patients studied had positive blood cultures. Ten variables showed significant differences, but only three variables (temperature &lt;38°C, sodium &lt;135 mEq/L and CURB-65 score) were selected for the multivariate analysis. The model developed showed limited capacity to predict the result of the blood cultures (R² = 0.176; Hosmer-Lemeshow: P = 0.338). CONCLUSIONS The data obtained in this series did not demonstrate clinical elements with sufficient capacity to predict the result of the blood cultures.</dc:description>
