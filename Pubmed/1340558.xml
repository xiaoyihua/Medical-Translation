<dc:description xml:lang="en">A National Committee from the Association of Medical Faculties has conducted a process of accreditation of training centers for specialists. Over a period of 13 years, 483 centers have been reviewed. Rejection of accreditation has been based on inadequate Faculty staff, or insufficient technical support for practice and teaching. Maximal number of trainees for each program are defined according to the available facilities. The Committee makes a strong recommendation to keep training programs under direct tuition from Medical Schools, especially faced with the interest of other medical care institutions in developing in service training. Also, a recommendation is put forward to organize cooperative programs among different Medical Schools and to give special emphasis to training programs for specialists in short supply.</dc:description>
