Coming from 27 hospital services. 82.2% of the derivatived patients were male. The half age of the patients was of 63, 25 years. 192 patients had personal urological records of interest (47%). The IC grouped in 27 different reasons. The reason of more frequent consultation was the incidentaloma with 21.5%. Regarding the grade of execution of the document of IC: there was perseverance of filiation data (96.3%), a description of the symptoms was in 68.2% and the physical examination appeared reflected in 8.8% of the total of the IC. They were requested as normal IC 63.4%, preferent 25% and urgent 11.7%. The days of answer to the IC it was of stocking of 1,45 days with typical deviation of 1,65 days. According to the established approaches, to classify the documents for adaptation level, they were classified as inappropriate to 32.9% of the IC (n = 135). They were classified in grade 1 the 44.6% (n = 183), grade 2 20% (n = 82) and grade 3 2.4% (n = 10). The attitude that was taken: it was remitted to External Consultations of Urology to 10.5% of the total of the IC, to the Center of Specialized Attention to 7.8%, it was requested complementary tests to 7.8%, it was remitted to the functional Tests of Urology, for the realization of some complementary test to 61 patients (14.9%), it was presented in Clinical Session of Urology to 5,6% of the patients, he/she moved to the Service of Urology to 2 patients (0.5%) and he/she took some other therapeutic attitude in 19.6%, these results had a p = 0.000 significance. CONCLUSION In our study, we observe a high percentage as for the perseverance of the data of lightly inferior filiation in the description of the symptoms and considered low in the physical exploration. A high percentage of inappropriate considered IC. Regarding the attitude that took the Service of Urology, maybe had a low used of the Functional Unit. Until the moment and under our knowledge a study carried out in the environment from the realized IC to the Service of Urology in a Hospital of third level only exists and we believe that the realization of studies would improve the quality from the attendance to our patients.</dc:description>
