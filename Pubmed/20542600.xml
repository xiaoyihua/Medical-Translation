<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To analyse association between the development of type 2 diabetes and the health-related quality of life (HRQL). DESIGN Descriptive cross-sectional study. SETTING Primary care centre in Ayamonte (Huelva). PARTICIPANTS Selection by simple random sampling between the patients registered with type 2 diabetes: n=143. The type 2 diabetes process is a tool that uses indicators of good clinical practice for the follow-up of the patients. Collection of data from records and personal interview for the questionnaire HRQL SF-36. RESULTS A total of 101 patients were analysed, of which 51.5% were women. the average age was 66.8 years (SD 11.3). Performing physical activity 52.5%. Time of evolution of diabetes: 9.6 years (SD 7.7). Quality Index of the process: 64.5%. Worst score in physical component HRQL, mean of 41.9 (SD 9.6). Men had a better score, and it improves if there is regular physical exercise (mean difference 19.5% IC95%CI: 10.2-28.8). Age was inversely associated with physical function (r -0.354 P&lt;0,005); and the time of evolution of diabetes with physical component (r -0.278 P&lt;0.005). Retinopathy (t=2.03 P&lt;0.04) and heart disease (t=2.6 P&lt;0.008) were associated with lowest score in physical component. The association of HRQL with metabolic control, self control of glucose and diabetes education was not significant. Physical activity and comorbid diseases predict HRQL. CONCLUSIONS The HRQL is poor in type 2 diabetics despite having good indicators in the process. The HRQL should be included as standard in the type 2 diabetes process.</dc:description>
