<dc:description xml:lang="en">Although clinical practice guidelines have contributed to improving the quality of health care offered to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the level of adherence to recommendations continues to be inadequate and variable. Standards of care in COPD are written after applying an evidence-based approach, with the aim of unifying health-care criteria, establishing levels of acceptable adherence, and providing a way to assess quality; the ultimate goal is to improve patient care. In this statement we propose a series of health-care quality criteria and related indicators that will facilitate the quantitative evaluation of adherence to recommendations. The level of adherence that should be required is stipulated. This statement is not intended to provide a detailed description of how COPD should be managed. The aim is rather to set out quality assurance criteria that will contribute to the improvement of health-care access and equity, guaranteeing application of the highest levels of scientific and technical quality possible within the constraints of available resources, with the final purpose of satisfying the patient with COPD. The quality criteria have been grouped in 3 categories: a) so-called key criteria, to which adherence is essential; b) a set of conventional quality standards; and c) health-care administrative standards. Finally, we propose a framework on which to base the eventual accreditation of health-care quality for COPD patients.</dc:description>
