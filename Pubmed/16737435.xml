<dc:description xml:lang="en">Among arterial aneurysms, splenic artery aneurysms are very uncommon in the current practice. The etiologic factors are in relation with: angiodysplasia, portal hypertension, pregnancy and atherosclerosis. The great majority are asymptomatic. Symptomatic cases are in relation with rupture in the peritoneum or in organs or structures of the vicinity. We present two cases of splenic artery aneurysm in a 57 year old man and in a 59 year old woman. In both cases the diagnosis was made by plain abdominal x-ray, abdominal scanner and abdominal aortography. Both cases were surgically treated by transverse laparotomy and total aneurysm resection. The pathology dictamen of the two cases was consistent with atherosclerosis. After 120 and 38 months of follow-up both patients are doing well and without evidence of splenic artery aneurysm. A review of this entity is exposed, with special reference in the etiology, symptomatology, diagnosis and treatment.</dc:description>
