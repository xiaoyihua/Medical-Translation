<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Clinical practice guidelines recommend achieving concentrations of LDL cholesterol less than 100 mg/dl (and in some cases less than 70 mg/dl) in patients with coronary artery disease and/or diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). We have examined the compliance with these objectives in patients treated in Spain with these conditions. METHODS Cross-sectional epidemiological study. Data were obtained during the visit of the study or, in their absence, based on data contained in the medical record by 874 doctors of the 17 autonomous communities in Spain. Demographic information, risk factors, cardiovascular and prescribed treatments were collected. RESULTS In the final analysis 6.988 (62.7% male) patients were included. 2586 (37%) had coronary disease, 2654 (38%) DM2 and 1748 (25%) both conditions. 65% had metabolic syndrome. Vascular risk factors median number was 4. 57% and 86% showed a concentration of LDL cholesterol &gt;100 and &gt;70 mg/dl respectively. The proportion patients with LDL concentration &gt;100 mg/dl was 4% greater in the DM2 (62.4%) than in coronary patients (57.1%; p0.0001). Concentration of triglycerides &gt;150 mg/dl was higher in patients with DM2 (50.5%) than in coronary patients (43.5%; p0.0001). The proportion of patients with LDL&gt;70 mg/dl was similar in the coronary group and in the DM2 Group (88.4% and 87.0%, respectively). More than half of patients with coronary heart disease (57.5%) or DM2 (55.7%) showed inadequate levels of HDL (&lt;40 mg/dl men; &lt;50 mg/dl women). CONCLUSIONS More than a half of patients with diabetes mellitus and/or coronary artery disease enrolled in the CODIMET study do not achieve the recommended LDL cholesterol target for high cardiovascular risk patients.</dc:description>
