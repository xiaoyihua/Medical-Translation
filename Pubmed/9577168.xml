<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The Multi-Link intracoronary stent is a balloon-expandable stainless steel stent with an interconnected ring structure designed to provide a high degree of compressive resistance while preserving longitudinal flexibility. We present the results of our initial experience with the implantation of this stent. PATIENTS AND METHODS From May 1996 to April 1997, 124 Multi-link stents were implanted in 97 patients. Mean age 62.2 +/- 11 years. All patients included had a coronary artery diameter &gt; 2.7 mm. Clinical presentation includes stable angina in 20, unstable angina in 72, and myocardial infarction in 5 patients. According to the ACC/AHA classification 6 lesions were type A, 72 type B and 19 type C. The implantation of the stent was for "de novo" lesions in 85 patients and for restenosis in 12. Patients were treated after the procedure with a combination of aspirin and ticlopidine, except six of them who received aspirin and acenocumarol. 16 patients were treated additionally with Abciximab. The degree of stenosis was determined by quantitative angiography. RESULTS The delivery of the stent was successful in all patients. The degree of stenosis before the procedure was 79.6 +/- 13.1%, and after the stent deployment was 17.7 +/- 11.4%. Three patients presented a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, two patients had a subacute stent thrombosis, one of them died due to heart failure. During a follow-up of 4.7 +/- 2.6 months five patients were readmitted with recurrent angina (4 due to restenosis and one for vessel occlusion) and one patient with heart failure after myocardial infarction died suddenly three weeks after the dilatation. CONCLUSIONS The Multi-Link stent was implanted successfully in all patients with a low incidence of complications, showing at the follow-up a reduced rate of clinical restenosis.</dc:description>
