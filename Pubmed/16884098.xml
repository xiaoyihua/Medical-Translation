<dc:description xml:lang="en">Teaching operative skills are of paramount importance to urology training, specially in the period of time of the residency. Because of that, the introduction of laparoscopy in our surgical activity must be followed by a careful planning of progressive training as an answer to this new need that would be well designed trying not to damage in whatever possible way to the patients operated with this new modality of surgical intervention. In this sense, each case and each indication of laparoscopy must be clarified individually, taking into account the basic principles of medical ethics (beneficency, no maleficency, justice and autonomy). So, it will be neccesary to decide about possible risks due to the experience of the surgeon or due to the modality of surgery. In this article, different options of training plannings in laparoscopy are mentioned taking as a reference the experience in laparoscopic prostatectomy, reasons of "prepared reconversion" are exposed and, finally, the authors explain the discussion about the subject and the extent of information offered to the patients looking for the best possibilities of decision making by the patients.</dc:description>
