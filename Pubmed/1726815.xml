<dc:description xml:lang="en">Air pollution was the subject of the 1990 Fall Meeting of the Chilean Society of Respiratory Diseases. The potential danger of air pollution was considered a serious challenge. Groups at special risk are children under 5 years of age, patients with chronic respiratory diseases (COPD) or cardiovascular disease, the aged and pregnant women. Santiago is located in a valley surrounded by mountains, with a large population and many industries. The anticyclonic conditions determine a dominant semiarid climate and air circulation is prevented by a thermal inversion layer. Unacceptably high levels of total suspension particles (TSP) and carbon monoxide have been measured by the network of air pollution monitoring stations during winter and fall. 70% of TSP comes from diesel engines of the public transportation system. Most of the CO comes from automobiles. High levels of O3 have been detected in the east and north areas of the city. Nitrous oxide interference may account for an underestimation of the O3 level in the downtown area. Errors in the methodology for measurement of SO2 interfere with adequate knowledge about this pollutant. Actions to control the level of pollutants should include modification of industrial processes, changes in the transportation systems and others that should be enforced by law. Cooperation of the population and a well defined political will are urgently needed to implement solutions.</dc:description>
