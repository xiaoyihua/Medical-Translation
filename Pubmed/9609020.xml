<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) is a result of fetomaternal incompatibility. Platelet destruction is caused by a maternal antibody directed against a fetal platelet antigen inherited from the father and lacking on the mother's platelets. The incidence and features of transplacental alloimmunization depend on the frequency of expression of platelet specific antigens; which are highly variable among different populations. AIM To determine the prevalence and characteristics of transplacental alloimmunization in a large group of pregnant women in Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied 3,041 samples obtained during the third trimester of gestation. In all samples, anti platelet antibodies were screened by ELISA with platelet membranes fixed to a microtiter plate. Positive samples were further studied for antigenic specificity with the monoclonal antibody specific immobilization of platelet antigens (MAIPA) test. RESULTS Anti platelet antibodies were found in 261 samples (8.5%). The MAIPA test identified 6 samples with antibodies directed against major platelet membrane glycoproteins, 2 anti GPIb, 2 anti GPIIb/IIIa and 2 anti GPIa/IIa. In four cases, anti HLA antibodies coexisted. Two cases corresponded to well defined platelet antigen systems: one anti HPA-1a and one anti HPA-5b. No clinical evidence of thrombocytopenia of the newborn was detected in all these cases with anti GP antibodies. CONCLUSIONS A prevalence of platelet specific antibodies of 0.2% with only one anti HPA-1a was detected. These findings are in contrast with those of other populations but in accordance with the low frequency of the HPA-1 b/b phenotype in the Chilean population. The very low incidence of platelet specific antibodies and the lack of association with clinical thrombocytopenia in the newborn, do not support the recommendation of routine antenatal screening to all women in Chile.</dc:description>
