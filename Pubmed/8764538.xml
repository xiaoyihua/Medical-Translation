<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To determine whether the epidemiological profile of gastric cancer is changing in our patient referral area. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We have compared the incidence rates of gastric cancer in our Hospital in two three year periods (1975 to 1977 and 1990 to 1992). Gastric cancer was diagnosed by endoscopy or surgery and confirmed histologically. Incidence rate was obtained calculating the ratio (cases of gastric cancer)/ (patients assisted at the hospital) for each period. RESULTS 522 patients were identified in the first period, and only 255 in the second. Then, the overall incidence fell from 96 x 10(5) to 37 x 10(5). In both periods a male predominance, with a sex ratio male/ female of 1.9 in the first period and 1.6 in the second, was observed. The mean age was also similar in both periods: 61 years (range 20-89) and 65.5 (range 28-90) respectively. Adenocarcinoma was the predominant neoplasm in both periods (98% and 95% respectively). There was also a predominance of antral tumors with a slight decrease of their incidence in the later series (ratio antrum/other gastric sites) from 1.6 to 1.1 respectively (p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS Although gastric cancer is still very common, its incidence in our referral area is decreasing. In addition, the characteristic antral predominance also seems to be decreasing. It remains to be established whether the changing pattern we have observed is related to environmental variation.</dc:description>
