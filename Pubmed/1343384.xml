<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) constitute a major cause of adult cardiac cardiovascular mortality in Chile. From July 87 to August 89 we prospectively studied 300 patients with CVA utilizing a multidisciplinary approach. Besides clinical evaluation this included brain CT scan (48 hrs), glucidic and lipid profile. Occlusive CVA were additionally studied with 2D-Echocardiogram, 24 hr Holter, Cerebral Angiography and/or carotid Duplex Echotomograph, and a second brain CT scan was performed within the first week. We found a 62.3% incidence of cerebral infarcts, 28.3% of cerebral hemorrhages and 9.3% of transient ischemic attacks. Cerebral infarcts were found to be cardiac related in 33.5% of cases, whereas 13.2% were lacunar, 4.4% were atherothrombotic and 14% had no precise etiology. Hypertension was associated to cerebral hemorrhages in 76% of cases, 26% of which were intracranial. At 2 months of follow-up 16.3% of patients were severely handicapped and mortality was 19.3%. We have confirmed that cerebral infarcts constitute the most common cause of CVA and most of them are cardiac related. Hypertension appears to be the most important cause of cerebral hemorrhage. A multidisciplinary approach to cerebrovascular accidents allowed a more precise diagnosis and contributed to implement appropriate therapeutic and preventive strategies. Proper identification of high risk patients could contribute to decrease the high incidence and mortality of CVA in our community.</dc:description>
