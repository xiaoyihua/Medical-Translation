<dc:title xml:lang="en">Severe or life-threatening interactions between antiretrovirals and non-HIV drugs</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Highly active antiretroviral therapy has helped to improved control of the HIV infection, and has led to a progressively older population with the infection having a life expectancy quite similar to that of the general population. On the other hand, it is also known that HIV infection, even in patients with undetectable viral loads and good immunity, carries an increased cardiovascular risk, as well as an increased incidence of certain cancers. Therefore, the majority of HIV-infected patients receive several drugs (either prescribed by the physician or self-administered) combined with antiretrovirals. This article reviews the interactions between antiretrovirals and other drugs that can cause significant damage to patients, or even be life-threatening and of whom clinicians, especially those not directly treating HIV-infected patients, should be aware. A review is also presented on the implications of interactions between antiretrovirals and other drugs in special situations, such as the co-administration with cytostatics, immunesuppressants used in solid organ transplantation, or patients receiving new treatments for hepatitis C. Generally, combinations with two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and raltegravir (or in the near future, dolutegravir) are those with less potential for clinically significant interactions (AU)</dc:description>
