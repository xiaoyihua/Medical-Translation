<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper is to analyze the peculiarities of a protocol for treatment with intratympanic gentamicin in patients with Ménière's disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS 71 patients with unilateral disabling Ménière's disease were followed for a period longer than two years after concluding the treatment. AAO-HNS criteria for reporting treatment results was followed. Gentamicin was applied weekly until of symptoms or signs of vestibular hypofunction were noticed. RESULTS Control of vertigo was obtained in 83% of the patients while in 24% a second course was needed beacuse of vertigo recurrence. 66% of the patients developed a typical syndrome of unilateral vestibular hypofunction in the ear treated. CONCLUSIONS Ending weekly injections of gentamicin for the treatment of patients with Ménière's disease when signs of vestibular hypofunction appear warrants a control of vertigo similar to that obtained in other series.</dc:description>
