<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery has become the procedure of choice to deal with morbid and super-morbid obesity, with the greatest chance of success. The objectives of this study were: a) to analyse the evolution of the percentage of excess BMI lost (PEBMIL) and quality of life in the medium and long term after bariatric surgery; b) to evaluate the differences in PEBMIL and quality of life according to the surgical technique performed; and c) examine the relationship between PEBMIL and quality of life. METHODS One hundred and ninety-one subjects participated in the present study, undergoing bariatric surgery with follow-up at 12 and 24 months after surgery. The SF-36 and OP-53 questionnaires were administered to assess the quality of life after surgery. RESULTS There was a statistically significant reduction in the percentage of excess BMI lost at 12 and 24 months; and a significant improvement in quality of life at 12 months, which remained stable at 24 months for most variables. Taking into account the surgical technique, those undergoing gastric bypass surgery show a greater loss of PEBMIL at 12 and 24 months, and significant improvement at one year of evaluation in most of the dimensions that measure quality of life with respect to the tubular vertical gastrectomy technique. CONCLUSION Bariatric surgery is effective in reducing the excess of BMI lost and significantly improving the quality of life of morbidly obese patients in the long term. Key words. Bariatric surgery. Quality of life. Morbid obesity.</dc:description>
