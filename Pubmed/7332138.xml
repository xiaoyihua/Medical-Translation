<dc:description xml:lang="en">Fourteen patients diagnosed of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NNE) admitted into the neonatal unit since August 1977 are presented. They were matched to a control group of 130 newborn infants born during that same period of time for sex, weight and gestational age. All patients were formula fed except for three who followed mixed feeding. NNE was closely associated to hypothermia (p less than 0.005), respiratory distress (p less than 0.001) and umbilical catheterization (p less than 0.005). Umbilical catheters introduced for reasons other than distress did not increase the incidence of NNE. Low birth weight infants were more frequently affected than those weighing over 2,500 gm (ratio, 27:1). Evolution was lethal in six cases. The remaining eight are presently under follow up with no evidence of disease.</dc:description>
