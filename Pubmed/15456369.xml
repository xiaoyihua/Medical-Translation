<dc:description xml:lang="en">The main focus of our study was to determine the prevalence of yeasts on the hands of Medicine students and other students not related to the Health care system. Between July 1999 and July 2000, 253 students of Medicine (163) and Engineering (90) were studied. Medicine students were grouped as basic (71), pre-clinical (62) and clinical (30). The Engineering's students were divided into three groups according to the years of study. The total yeasts carried on the hands of Medicine's students were 16%. By group the results were 7% for the basic, 19% for the pre-clinical and 30% for the clinical and the prevalence of the two last groups was higher than the first one. The Engineering's students showed 9% prevalence without differences between years of career. The yeast carriage in the clinical group was higher than the equivalent control group (10%). The species frequently encountered were Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (Rhodotorula rubra) and Candida parapsilosis, with a tendency to a higher species diversity and colony count in the pre-clinical and clinical groups. This finding could explain the high prevalence of candidemia by C. parapsilosis in our hospitals. In summary, yeast carriage, diversity and quantity in Medicine students were related to the time of being in the hospital environment.</dc:description>
