<dc:description xml:lang="es">Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a painful condition, very common in aged patients that have suffered acute manifestations of herpes zoster. Early administration of antiviral therapy seems to reduce the incidence of the disease. Drugs used for its management include tricyclic antidepressants, local lidocaine through patches, i.v. lidocaine, i.v. ketamine, weak opiates and some anticonvulsants. Gabapentine (GB) belongs to the groups of third-generation antiepileptics, characterized by an excellent effectivess-safety profile. While its mechanism of action is not well known, it apparently binds with high affinity to a Ca+ channel type L subunit and increases the production and pre-synaptic secretion of GABA. This double mechanism of action reduces neuronal hyperexcitability, improving the hyperalgesia and allodynia that a represent in multiple models of neuropathic pain. On the other hand, the synergy between its two mechanisms of action provides increased benefit in the PHN with minimum incidence of adverse effects. Two multicenter, randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled studies have shown that GB is better than placebo and exerts its activity since the first doses, its benefit lasting over long periods of time, while the treatment is administered. The e ffect of GB does not seem to be dose-dependant, although its has been observed that higher doses result in i m p roved analgesia after the fourth week of therapy (AU)</dc:description>
