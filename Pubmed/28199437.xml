<dc:description xml:lang="en">The emergence of Phenomenology cannot to be understood outside the context of naturalism, the crisis affecting the philosophy and the scientific foundation of psychology toward the end of the 19th century. Binswanger thinks Husserl's attempt to found the experience of the things themselves in intentional living structures can to be useful to guide the psychiatric examination. For that, he seeks in the fundamental dimensions of existence, the conditions of possibility of being sick, which are also those of the same psychiatry. While the phenomenological psycho(patho)logy has not born of direct confrontation with patients, it doesn't mean that it doesn't have internal references with practice. It's proposed then a semiological Eidetic founded in multiple modes of intentionality, or "basic categories", opposite of semiology supported on psychic functions. From etiology to the anthropological a priori of mental illnesses, from the symptom to the phenomenon, here are two possible readings in the field of the clinic.</dc:description>
