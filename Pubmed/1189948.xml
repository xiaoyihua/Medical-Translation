<dc:description xml:lang="en">Before psychological treatment is prescribed, one should take into account, with utmost detail and depth, the ways and styles of integration of patients into their family-systems. In order to prove this contention we use the theoretical framework of C. A. Paz and D. Liberman, in connection with criteria of "analyzability". We include three clinical examples in which the need for a model allowing for the systemic character of family organization and marriage partnership is put into evidence. The model is built up starting from developments made in the field of Cybernetics which in turn are based upon Set theory.</dc:description>
