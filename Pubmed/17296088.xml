<dc:description xml:lang="en">Time orientation is a fundamental psychological variable, what it flows all aspects of human behaviour. Past, present, and future orientation decomposed of allocated into different temporal frames the continual flow of behaviour, providing meaning and coherence. It has been proposed the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI) so multidimensional measure of time orientation, which include positive and negative evaluation of past and present, as well as future evaluation. The factorial structure and reliability of ZTPI was analysed on Spanish adult population. The participants were 756 adults with age range 19-67 years old ( M = 40.1, SD = 15.45). The principal components analyses showed five factors, very similar to obtain on nort-american undergraduate samples, even thought a little difference in composition of the present-fatalist factor. The reliability of each factor was suitable. Age and gender differences analysis showed that older groups were more future oriented and less present hedonist, female were high orientation to past negative, past positive and present fatalist, while young females were more future oriented than older females.</dc:description>
