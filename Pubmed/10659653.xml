<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The importance of the clinical presentation in the frequency and type of recurrences of ventricular arrhythmias in patients that received an automatic implantable defibrillator is not well known. The purpose of this study was to analyze the frequency and type of recurrences in patients with an old myocardial infarction that received an automatic implantable defibrillator with electrogram recording. METHODS AND RESULTS We analyzed 100 patients classified in 3 groups according to their clinical presentation: Sustained Monomorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (VT Group n = 65), Cardiac Arrest (CA Group = 19), and Syncope (Syncope Group n = 16). There were no significant differences in the clinical variables among the different groups, nor in the inducibility of arrhythmia at the electrophysiologic study. In a follow-up 27 +/- 14 months, 54% of patients presented at last one episode of sustained ventricular arrhythmia. All recurrences except one were as sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (776 episodes). 81% of episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (630) were treated with antitachycardia pacing with an effectiveness of 89%. There were no differences in the probability of arrhythmic recurrence among groups but death probability was higher in the ventricular fibrillation group at 36 follow-up months (38% vs 7% and 12% in the sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and syncope groups respectively, p = 0.0113). CONCLUSIONS In the patients with an old myocardial infarction and malignant ventricular arrhythmias, most of recurrences are due to sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia independently of the clinical presentation. The antitachycardia pacing is not only effective in patients with documented sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia but also in those that are presented as cardiac arrest or syncope.</dc:description>
