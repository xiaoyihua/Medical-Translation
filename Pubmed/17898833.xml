<dc:description xml:lang="en">Tuberculosis is a clear example of infection that requires cellular immunity for its control. The spread throughout the world of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) resulted in its interaction with tuberculosis altering the descending curve of the latter disease in some developed countries, and brought an aggravation of the problem in other countries with few economic and health resources and where tuberculosis was endemic. HIV increases the risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection and accelerates progression after infection or reinfection; on the other hand, TB aggravates the prognosis of patients infected with HIV. This article sets out the differential aspects in the clinical manifestations of TB amongst populations with and without HIV infection; we also comment on some special characteristics in the treatment of tuberculosis in HIV patients. With the exception of primary cutaneous infections produced by accidental inoculation and infantile lymphadenitis, the majority of the cases of disease due to non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) affect patients with certain predisposing factors. In the case of patients with AIDS, the deep immunological disorder provoked by HIV brings a particular susceptibility to suffering invasive disease due to certain NTM, principally M. avium complex and M. kansasii.</dc:description>
