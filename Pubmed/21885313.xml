<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIMS To study the reliability (inter-observer agreement and internal consistency) of the Spanish version of the Nursing Outcome "Knowledge: Health Resources" and determine the differences in reliability when used by nurses in two settings: community care and hospital care. METHOD Reliability study. 12 experienced nurses were paired (community and hospital) to use this nursing outcome questionnaire to assess health service users. Data were obtained by direct interview with 60 patients. Statistical analysis was performed to obtain; weighted kappa index, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), and internal consistency by Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS The inter-observer agreement on the "Knowledge: Health Resources" outcome in Spanish was measured by weighted Kappa 0.557 (95% CI=0.381-0.733) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.561 (95% CI=0.361-0.712). The indicators showed values ranging from κ=0.268 I to κ=0.507. The internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha=0.854). There were no statistically significant differences in reliability when used in different settings: community care and hospital. CONCLUSIONS The Spanish version of this nursing outcome has a moderate reliability. A cultural adaptation of this outcome should be made.</dc:description>
