<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND There is a lack of information on the characteristics of the medical attention delivered to Mexican patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to describe the current state on the medical management of T2D in Mexico. METHODS Among 17,232 patients included in the International Diabetes Management Practices Study (IDMPS), 2,620 (15%) corresponded to Mexico. Information regarding clinical, demographics and management characteristics, as well as the impact of T2D in the patient is clinical and social condition was registered. The metabolic control and achievement of therapeutic goals were also analyzed. RESULTS Diagnosis of T2D was performed by the general practitioner in 76% of cases. Only about a quarter of the cohort had a blood pressure goal of &lt; 130/80 mmHg, although 97% had anti-hypertensive treatment. Management of T2D was with diet and exercise exclusively in 5%, with oral glucose-lowering drugs (OGLD) in 66% (alone or combined), with OGLD and insulin in 18%, and with insulin alone in 11%. Only 31% of patients reached the goal of HbA1c &lt; 7. Self-monitoring was practiced in 50% of patients and 26% received education on diabetes. The managing physician is personal impression about the quality of the metabolic control was not in accordance with HbA1c. Eight percent of patients had work absences in the last 3 months due to complications of T2D (mean of 15 days lost). CONCLUSIONS In Mexico, quality of metabolic control of T2D patients could have important deficiencies. The personal impression of the physician on the patient is metabolic control is not consistent with objective data.</dc:description>
