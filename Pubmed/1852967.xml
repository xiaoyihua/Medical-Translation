<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report a case of a patient, with no conduction abnormalities, who had took 1,800 mg of diltiazem in an attempted suicide. We haven't come across a similar case, which is not associated with other drugs, in bibliography we have consulted. She had conduction abnormalities at different levels, such as atrioventricular block and sinoatrial block, but after a few hours sinus rhythm returned without more complicated treatment. Serial electrocardiograms showed the different types of block. Although we didn't make an electrophysiologic study, we made vagal tests which were normal.</dc:description>
