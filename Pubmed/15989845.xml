<dc:description xml:lang="en">The need for an effective and safe medical treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is urgent due to its high prevalence and progressive character. At the moment, therapeutic strategies are largely empirical and based on the control of associated clinical conditions (especially obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertriglyceridemia) and the use of some specific drugs (insulin sensitizing agents, cytoprotectives, antioxidants, and anticytokines) as an attempt to counteract known elements of the pathogenesis. None of these specifics measures have been found to display enough evidence to recommend their clinical use. It is indispensable to join efforts in coordinated networks to define, as soon as possible, the best treatment and the best time to start it.</dc:description>
