<dc:description xml:lang="en">Haemophilus influenzae is an infrequent etiologic agent of bacterial meningitis in adult patients. In the last 12 years, it was the cause in 12 out of 238 cases (5.0%) of acute bacterial meningitis in adults. There were 5 men and 7 women with a mean age (SD) of 45.4 (16) years (range: 18-68 years). Seven patients (60%) had a communication between subarachnoid space and skin surface or mucosal cavities, and five (41.7%) had otitis or sinusitis. Most of the strains (9/12) were serotype b. Only one patient (8.3%) developed severe neurologic and extra-neurologic complications, and was the one who died. One of the survivors (9.1%) had partial deafness. H. influenzae is not a negligible cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. Moreover, its detection has been increasing in the last years. Patients with a cerebrospinal fluid leak, otitis or sinusitis are at high risk. The outcome is usually favorable if an early adequate therapy is given.</dc:description>
