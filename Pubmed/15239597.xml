<dc:description xml:lang="en">Asymptomatic malaria is characteristic of high intensity transmission areas in Africa but unusual in low transmission areas in Latin America. Nevertheless, asymptomatic malaria has been reported to be frequent in areas in Latin America with high and moderate intensity of transmission. Asymptomatic malaria can affect both individuals who carry parasites and are cryptic carrier reservoirs for the community. Individuals chronically infected with malaria parasites are usually unidentifiable by most malaria control programmes. In order to identify whether asymptomatic individuals harboring malaria parasites are an important reservoir of infection in Quibdó, Chocó, the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria was assessed in schoolchildren. This study was part of a major study of the epidemiology of malaria in Quibdó. A total of 255 children from 5 schools were examined, of which 223 were included in the analysis. Children reported headache (34%), cough (32%), and diarrhoea (9%). None of the children presented a positive thick smear. In addition, IFA tests in a subsample of 25 children were negative. By these criteria, the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in Quibdó schoolchildren is 0% (95%C.I.: 0.0-1.4). Although asymptomatic malaria in adults possibly occurs, a very low prevalence is predicted.</dc:description>
