<dc:title xml:lang="en">Apnea and apparent life threatening events. A review of our cases</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objetive. To review the epidemology, risks factors, characteristics of the events, evaluation procedures and final diagnoses of the patients admitted to hospital under suspicion of apparent life-threatening event (ALTE). Material and methods. Retrospective study of infants under 1 year of age admitted to our hospital in short stay medical unit whose reason for attendance was APNEA/ALTE. Results. 82 patients were recruited. 74% younger than 2 months; 56,1% boys. Most respiratory pauses occurred while awake (69,5%), without apparent trigger (51,2%) and with skin colour changes (81,1%). Associated symptoms were observed in 94% of patients: mostly upper respiratory symptoms (41%), change in muscle tne (30%), vomit/regurgitation (20,7%9 and limb or eye abnormal movements (18,3%), Abnormal finding in physical examination were found in 28% of the cases, being cadiopulmonar signs the most frequent (14,6%). Most of the evaluation procedures did not offer useful information in most cases. Real apneas during monitorization were detected in 8% of cases. Conclusions. This type of events are more frequent among under 2 months of age. The first recommended procedure in the emergency department should be patient´s monitoring. Evaluation procedures should be done according to event history and physical examination. A complete apnea protocol should only be offered to infants presenting with real apneas during monitorization (AU)</dc:description>
