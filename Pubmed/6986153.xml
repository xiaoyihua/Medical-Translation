<dc:description xml:lang="en">The clinical picture of 3 infants with systemic candidiasis who recovered spontaneously is described and a correlation is made between the clinical findings and laboratory data. The clinical picture is similar to that of 16 patients who died, some with septicemia of bacterial origin. The authors consider predisposing factors favoring the development of systemic mycotic infection such as: use of multiple antibiotics, continuous use of catheters, deficiency of IGA (in one patient). The diagnosis was suspected due to the prolonged course, the ill-defined toxic and infectious manifestations, the poor or lack of response to antibiotics and the negativity of bacterial blood cultures. The presence of Candida in various sites and cultures with positive serologic tests for Candida confirmed the diagnosis. Some considerations about antimycotic therapy are made and some circumstances that make the spontaneous cures of mycosis possible are considered.</dc:description>
