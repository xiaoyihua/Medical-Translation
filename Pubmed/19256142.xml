<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the present paper, some of the recent epidemiological, etiological, clinical and anatomopathological data related to hepatocellular carcinoma are reviewed. We make an analysis in regard to the frequency of this disease in several geographic areas, with an elevated incidence such as Africa and Southeast Asia in contrast with Occidental countries including ours. Special mention is made related to the world wide increasing frequency of this type of cancer. The close association with hepatitis B virus is analyzed as a major oncogenic factor in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients; a list of other hepatocarcinogenetic substances and congenital hepatic metabolic errors is made. The clinical, prognostic factors, paraneoplastic syndroms and the important role of the alpha-fetoprotein are described. The macroscopic and microscopic appearances of this neoplasm with unusual forms are illustrated. Finally, we describe preliminary data of the cases seen in our hospital, where a slightly increased rate predominantly in women was detected, that differs from previously published series; the patients average age was similar to those mentioned in other countries with a low incidence of hepatic carcinoma; the role of cirrhosis in our cases was similar to that mentioned in the United States.</dc:description>
