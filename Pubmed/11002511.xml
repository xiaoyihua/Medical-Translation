<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The present article reviews the different aspects of "burned out" testicular tumor. METHODS A survey of the literature on "burned out" testicular tumor in Medline 1980-1999 was performed. The selected articles referenced in the present study were reviewed. RESULTS The "burned out" phenomenon is the regression of a testicular tumor focus after distant metastasis whose cause is unknown. However, characteristic histological lesions have been identified, such as lesions comprised of collagen tissue containing neoplastic cells. The diagnosis is based on the anatomopathological study of the orchidectomy specimen, which should be performed in patients with extragonadal germ cell tumor and alterations detected on physical or ultrasound examination. CONCLUSIONS "Burned out" testicular tumor should be taken into account in patients with extragonadal germ cell tumor. The importance of a thorough physical examination and testicular ultrasound evaluation is emphasized. Chemotherapy may not be effective. Orchidectomy may improve the outcome in these tumors.</dc:description>
