<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the level of work satisfaction and professional wear and tear among primary care doctors, and related factors. DESIGN Crossover descriptive study. SETTING Asturias PC. SUBJECTS General doctors (GD), family doctors (FD), residents, and PC paediatricians (n = 810). MEASUREMENTS A survey for self-administration with social and demographic variables and suggestions. The Font Roja-PC questionnaire (FR). The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). RESULTS 497 (55.6% male) responded (61.35%). Mean age was 41 (SD = 7.18) 57.3% worked in an urban environment. 42% were FD, 35% GD, 15% paediatricians, 7% residents. The PC model was: 84% PC teams, 9% traditional model, 7% normal emergency service (NES). Mean seniority was 14 years (SD = 7.5). 89% worked solely in PC. 59% had a permanent contract, 31% provisional contracts, 7% were residents and 3% temporary. Overall mean satisfaction (OMS): 73.73 points. 43% had high professional wear and tear, 23% moderate and 32% low. Statistically significant associations: OMS/social and demographic variables: greater in men, the rural environment, paediatrics, NES, without stand-by, with less bureaucracy and less case pressure. Satisfaction/FR: greater NES, without stand-by, without sole dedication. Case pressure/FR: greater in men, rural environment, paediatrics, without sole dedication, NES, without stand-by and with less demand. Control/FR: greater in permanent and provisional posts. Relationship/FR: greater in men, FD, without stand-by. Suitability/FR: greater in men, paediatricians, permanent doctors, without stand-by. Relaxation/FR: greater in residents, young people, without sole dedication, NES. Variety/FR: greater in young people, those without children, residents, with sole dedication, those with stand-by. MBI/social and demographic variables: greater level of low emotional tiredness in workers in a rural environment and those with children. Greater low level of alienation in women. The older the doctor, the less the professional burnout. CONCLUSIONS 1. High level of work satisfaction. 2. High-moderate professional wear and tear.</dc:description>
