<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Traumatic perforation of the anorectal canal in children is relatively uncommon. There may be difficulties in recognizing or properly treating such injuries because their severity may not be reflected accurately by the external appearance of the perineum.

RESULT Sixteen (89.4%) were male and 15 (77.0%)suffered perforation after al fall on a sharp tool. All were admitted more than 12 hours after accident. Twelve (63.0%) had transanal extra-peritoneal injuries and 13 (68.4%) patients underwent colostomy. CONCLUSIONS The majority of these perforations are caused by falls at play. The current standard principles in the treatment of anorectal injuries in children and wound drainage, broad-spectrum antibiotics and frequently fecal diversion.</dc:description>
