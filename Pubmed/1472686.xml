<dc:description xml:lang="en">We study the clinic, surgical pathologic aspects of 81 patients with cancer of the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, dividing them in 4 groups by localization. The majority of cases were women, the average in age was 57.05 years with the greatest incidence between the 5th and 6th decade of life. We can conclude that the symptoms and signs are not useful as well as the laboratory and radiologic test. Adenocarcinoma was the most common type of cancer and the outcome of the patients was very poor because cancer has grown beyond the limits of resectability before it is clinically apparent. Its important to be aware that 80% of the cancers of the gallbladder had lithiasis.</dc:description>
