<dc:description xml:lang="en">A 35-year-old woman was scheduled for laparoscopic removal of an ovarian tumor. Intravenous metamizol was administered and when pneumoperitoneum was performed she developed severe hypotension and bronchospasm. Anaphylactic reaction was suspected, all drugs were suspended, and 2 doses of intravenous adrenalin (0.2 and 1 mg) were injected followed by continuous perfusion. Because response was slow and given the unknown origin of the tumor, the possibility of a carcinoid crisis was considered. When an intravenous bolus dose of octreotide was administered, pressure recovered, patient was extubated and could be transferred asymptomatic to the recovery ward. Tests later ruled out carcinoid syndrome, whereas tryptase levels in blood extracted during surgery and allergy tests confirmed an anaphylactic reaction to metamizol. Carcinoid crisis can be difficult to distinguish from anaphylactic reaction because the clinical pictures are similar. Anesthetic management of carcinoid crisis has been facilitated by administration of octreotide. Less is known about the use of octreotide to treat hypotension in patients with autonomic neuropathy based mainly on the drug's ability to produce splanchnic vasoconstriction. This is probably the reason why octreotide resolved our patient's shock in a context of systemic vasodilation caused by the anaphylactic reaction.</dc:description>
