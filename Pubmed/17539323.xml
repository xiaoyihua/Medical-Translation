<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Human corioamniotic membranes, or their equivalent in the rat, function as selective barrier during gestation and their rupture is part of the mechanisms implied in the labor. Molecular mechanisms carried out in this process are unknown. TYPE OF STUDY Experimental animal model. MATERIAL AND METHODS Corioamniotic membranes (obtained at the beginning of the labor) of rats with programmed and synchronous pregnancies were analized. The coexistence and distribution of metalloproteinase of extracellular-3 matrix (estromelisine) in these tissues were determined. RESULTS Secretion and tissue location of metalloproteinase of extracellular-3 matrix in fetal membranes were identified for the first time. Metalloproteinase of extracellular-3 matrix was immunolocated in the compact layer of the amnion and its secretion (by the membranes) was confirmed through electrophoresis, zimography and Western blot. By confocal microscopy it was verified that metalloproteinase of extracellular-3 matrix is located in the same places of that of extracellular-9 matrix. CONCLUSIONS Rupture of corioamniotic membranes relates to the expression and local activity of the metalloproteinases of extracellular matrix. The coexistence of metalloproteinase of extracellular-3 matrix in the amnion of the rat has been identified; this element is added to the biochemical process of rupture, since metalloproteinase of extracelular-3 matrix is an activator of that of extracellular-9 matrix. It is possible that the physiological function of this enzyme is implied, of a main way, in the process of rupture of corioamniotic membranes during the childbirth.</dc:description>
