<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The majority of preterm formulas have included long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAS) for the relationship with visual and cognoscitive brain development. This work tried to probe the tolerance and acceptability of a preterm formula from the point of view of palatability for the LCPUFAs origin. METHODS Infants under 37 weeks of gestational age at birth and birth weight below 2,500g with the possibility of being fed by suction and not receiving breast milk were included. Using a scale modified from "Pain Analog Scale," the nurse who was feeding the infant had to qualify the baby's facial expression at these moments. RESULTS 50 infants with age 37.2 +/- days of life at least receiving the formula for 3 complete days were included. Ninety percent of them had weight gain each day and the third day was the most. There were no problems in number and frequency of stools. Thus, 782 evaluations by the nurses were made (15 for each patient); 66.8% of the time the infants accepted the formula with no problem; 21.1% were satisfactory; 3.7% were very satisfactory. Also, 91.8% of the nurses declared their satisfaction with the formula, and in 4 cases they declared dissatisfaction. They attributed it to the patient's pathology.</dc:description>
