<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of retransplantation in graft and recipient survival. METHODS We carried out a retrospective study in 419 renal transplants and studied the influence of retransplantation in graft and patient survival. A homogeneity study was performed between the two groups with a Student`s T and a chi-square tests. Graft survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meyer and log rank tests. RESULTS Of 419 transplants, 370 (88.3%) were first transplantations, 45 (10.7%) second transplantations and 4(1%) third ones. Mean follow-up of the whole group was 72.5 months (±54.1 SD). There were no differences in follow-up between groups (Mean Follow-up 73.1 months ±54.4 SD in first transplantations vs. 61.6 months ±51.2 SD in repeat transplantation. p &gt;0.05). The actuarial graft survival showed no differences between patients with first transplantation and those with a repeat one. [3 and 5 year SV of 89% (95% CI: 87-91%) and 84%(95% CI: 82-86%) Vs 88% (95% CI; 83-93%) and 85% (95% CI:i; 80-90%) respectively]. After adjusting for all the heterogeneity variables we still did not find differences on graft survival. The actuarial recipient survival showed no differences between patients with first transplantation and those with a repeat one. [3 and 5 year SV of 98% and 96% Vs.97%]. CONCLUSIONS There are no differences of graft and recipient survival between patients with a first transplantation and those with a repeat one.</dc:description>
