<dc:description xml:lang="en">The parathyroid cyst is a very infrequent entity, so much so that only round about 200 cases have been described up to now. It can be functional and non-functional. The studies of image don't clarify to us if procedence becomes of parathyroid or it has another origin, and the diagnosis is made with the analysis come from the liquid obtained in the puncture aspiration, where high PTH's concentrations are seen. Surgery is the treatment for functional cysts and the puncture aspiration for non- functional, the fact that they use to get solved with only one but sometimes is necessary to repeated it, even more than one time, keeping for the surgery when recurrent. We presented a clinical case of recurrent parathyroid cyst and his natural evolution, due to patient rejects surgery, being necessary repeated punctures. It hasn't become malignant after 10 years and his functional status wasn't changed, being necessary to accomplish repeated punctures aspirations each 2-3 months for local bothers.</dc:description>
