<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The practical application of a questionnaire designed to evaluate the quality of life of an epileptic child, known as the CAVE test, is described. This is the first scale of its kind. The test consists of 8 parameters: conduct, attendance at school, learning, independence, social relationships, frequency of crises, intensity of crises and parental opinion. Each aspect is given a score, from a minimum of 1 point to a maximum of 5 points. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 203 tests were carried out. 179 of these were considered to be useful. Nine Spanish neuropediatric departments took part in this study. The age limits were from 0 to 14 years old. The best results showed a direct relationship to the children's age, idiopathic etiology and monotherapy as treatment. The quality of life worsened from those with partial simple crises to those with typical absences and generalized tonic-clonic crises. The lowest scores were found in children with infantile spasms and in those with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. There was a clear statistical relationship between the highest score obtained and the best clinical condition, with regard to the frequency and intensity of crises. Parental opinion was in keeping with the clinical evaluation of the disorder to a certain extent. CONCLUSION The study is still in progress, so as to interview 1000 children altogether. Then any modifications considered advisable will be made by the multicentre group of the Sociedad Española de Neurología Pediátrica, and may be validated internationally.</dc:description>
