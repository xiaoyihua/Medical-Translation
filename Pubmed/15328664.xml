<dc:description xml:lang="en">Hepatic involvement by tuberculosis is a rare type of manifestation of the disease. There are several forms of clinical presentations. One of them is the hepatic tuberculoma in which we base our presentation. Given that hepatic tuberculoma is a rare entity and generally shows inespecific symptoms, it is rarely suspected by the clinical picture. The diagnosis of hepatic tuberculosis is generally done in the intraoperative or postoperative period by analyzing a specimen taken by laparoscopy or laparotomy during the study of a hepatic mass. Laboratory tests or image studies do not give pathognomonic information to conform the diagnosis. The cornerstone in the treatment of this pathology is the antituberculous therapy. Surgical or endoscopic interventions are occasionally required. The role of surgery in the treatment of this pathology is reserved for a few solitary lesions. Once the correct treatment is performed the outcome is favorable. We present 4 cases of hepatic tuberculoma with different imaging and clinical presentations.</dc:description>
