<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Sudden death is not uncommon in patients with severe congestive heart failure. The aim of our study was to assess the incidence, mechanisms and clinical predictors of sudden death in a large series of patients with severe congestive heart failure evaluated for heart transplantation. METHODS With this aim we have reviewed our experience on 240 consecutive patients with severe heart failure studied in our hospital from May 1986 to June 1992. Heart failure was due to ischemic heart disease in 35% of patients and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 65%. Age was 47 +/- 12 years, left ventricular ejection fraction was 20 +/- 6%, and symptom class was IV in 88% of patients and III in 12%. RESULTS Sixty-eight of the 240 patients (28%) died without transplantation. Death was sudden in 21 patients (31% of deaths, and 9% of all patients), due to heart failure in 41 (68%), and due to malignancy (ampuloma) in 1 (1%). Mechanism of sudden death could be identified in 12 cases: ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation in 8 and bradycardia/electromechanical dissociation in 4. On multivariate analysis (stepwise logistic regression), a lower tolerated captopril dosage (p = 0.004), a lower systolic blood pressure (p = 0.079) and a history of a ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (p = 0.073) were independent predictors of sudden death. CONCLUSIONS It seems possible to identify, between patients with severe heart failure, a subgroup of patients at higher risk for sudden death by means of such simple clinical parameters.</dc:description>
