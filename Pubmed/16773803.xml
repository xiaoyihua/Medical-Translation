<dc:description xml:lang="en">The violence is systematized here in five types. The violence of terrorism is described as a modality of organized criminality elaborated for dominating other people in the field of politics, religion, economics or nationalism by means of terror. The terrorist action produces more important pathological effects on the mental health than the war and the natural or technological disaster. The terrorist is a fanatic ready to fight somehow for his ideals, deprivated of own freedom and sense of reality. There are many people mentally affected for each person killed or imprisoned. Finally, the early treatment of victims is distributed into psychological intervention and psychotropic drugs.</dc:description>
