<dc:description xml:lang="en">The clinical records of 185 cases of Salmonellosis have been reviewed retrospectively, in order to study a relation between the evolution and the treatment given, so as to be able to determine the therapeutic criteria. 139 cases showed as gastroenteritis, 48 of which received antibiotic treatment and 91 did not. Statistic differences were observed in favour of the non treated cases where, the average time of hospitalization, the negative copro-cultive and the onset of complications were more favourable. All the cases with Tipho-Paratific fever were treated with antibiotics without finding any significant differences in the clinical evolution not withstanding the antibiotic used. The data here obtained is compared with that previously reported. According to the results a treatment planning is suggested.</dc:description>
