<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Varicose ulcers (UV) are a serious health problem which produce tremendous pain for those who suffer from them; furthermore, they consume a large amount of health care system resources. Hydro-cellular dressings provide a moist environment cure option as a local treatment of varicose ulcers. MATERIALS AND METHODS With the purpose of evaluating the use of an Allevyn non-adhesive hydro-cellular dressing under real clinical conditions, an open, observational multi-centric study was carried out. The study group was composed of outpatient care patients or patients hospitalized due to having varicose vein ulcers or having a mixed etiology with an ankle/arm index less than or equal to 0.8. MAIN RESULTS 24 patients were initially part of this study; two of these abandoned this study group without a justified reason. Of the 22 who finished this study, 16 or 72.7% were women while 6 or 27.3% were men. The mean age in the women patients was 73.07 +/- 9.31 (DS), while among the men patients, the mean age was 67.23 +/- 18.17 (DS). 17 or 77.3% of the ulcers studied were varicose, 1 or 4.5% had a mixed etiology, 1 or 4.5% was due to amputation, and in three cases, the kind of ulcer was not specified. 22 patients finished this study with their lesions healed or in the process of healing; 2 abandoned this study without justification. The patient study group passed from an average initial sore area (IC 95%) or 9.41 or 19.42 cm2 to a final average sore area (IC 95%) of 4.45 or 10.5 cm2 with a mean percent reduction of (IC 95%) 57.22 or 86.22%. In 7 cases or 31.8% of the patients, their lesions healed completely during the course of the study. Inside the group of patients whose lesion did not fully heal during this study, the average initial sore area (IC 95%) was 15.66 +/- 12.75 cm2, a mean of 8.6 or 22.2 cm2 and the medium equaled 9 cm2. The information regarding comfort, absorption quality, ease in application and removal, and its fine results in the presence of pain and in the creation of new lesions once the dressing has been removed as well as the absolute lack of adverse reactions indicates we have discovered an excellent therapeutic option.</dc:description>
