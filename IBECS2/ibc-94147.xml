<dc:title xml:lang="en">Blood-stream catheter related infection in inpatient children receiving parenteral nutrition</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Blood-stream catheter related infection is the most severe complication in patients carrying a central venous catheter. Parenteral nutrition (PN) use seems to be a risk factor for developing a catheter-related infection (CRI). Material &amp; methods: In order to know the incidence of CRI in children to further implement policies to reduce nosocomial infection, we review all charts of children (1 month to 17 years) who received parenteral nutrition while in hospital. All episodes of fever + positive blood culture were recorded. Infection rate was defined as number of episodes/1000 Parenteral nutrition days. Results: 48 positive blood cultures was obtained from 120 patients. Infection rate was 37.8/1000 days. Incidence was significantly higher in infants and toddlers (52% vs 29.8%, p = 0.016). Most frequent organisms were coagulase negative Staph. (56.8%), Gram negative bacilli (20.8%), Staph aureus (12.5%) and fungus (12.5%). No difference in incidence were found according to the underlying disease or the length of PN use. Conclusions: Infection rate in our PN inpatient patients was significantly higher. PN may represent a risk factor for developing a CRI. Specific measurements and policies need to be implemented to overcome present situation (AU)</dc:description>
