<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION During the last decade, the neuroprotective effects of minocycline have been a matter of an intense debate. A broad amount of contradictory studies can be found in the scientific literature, going from neuroprotection to the exacerbation of toxicity in diverse experimental models. Such differences could be the result of minocycline acting on multiple pharmacological targets. DEVELOPMENT In the present review we will go over these pharmacological targets and the effects derived from their modulation by minocycline. Among others, its antioxidant activity derived from its chemical structure or its modulator effect on several enzymes such as nitric oxide synthase will be reviewed. Furthermore, the effects of minocycline on the intracellular pathways implicated in neurodegenerative processes including apoptosis stages, activation decision and execution will be addressed. CONCLUSIONS All the mechanisms described herein have not escaped to a scientific community needed of new therapeutic drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions. However, the sparse clinical trials carried out so far are mainly aimed at assessing its tolerability and safety or are still in progress. We believe that more studies, both clinical and pre-clinical, should be carried out in order to ascertain the therapeutic window and the neurodegenerative disorders in which minocycline could be useful.</dc:description>
