<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of lymph node involvement in patients with clinically localised prostate adenocarcinoma who had radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective observational study was conducted on 137 patients with clinically localised prostate cancer of low, intermediate or high risk according to the D'Amico classification. All participants underwent radical prostatectomy plus extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in 3 reference centres in Bogota, Colombia, between 2013 and 2014. The following variables were assessed: age, prostate specific antigen levels, Gleason score of the biopsy, probability of lymph node involvement calculated with Partin tables and the histopathology result of the surgical specimen, with the definitive Gleason pattern and the total number of resected and involved lymph nodes per tumour, according to the territory of the dissection. RESULTS A total of 2,876 lymph nodes were extracted (an average of 20.99 lymph nodes per patient). There was lymph node involvement in 14 (10.22%) patients. The high-risk and intermediate-risk group presented lymph node metastases in 28.57% and 5.25%, respectively. There was no lymph node involvement in the low-risk group. Of the patients at risk of lymph node involvement (≥2% according to the Partin tables), 19.40% had lymph node metastases. CONCLUSION Lymph node involvement in our population is similar to that reported in the worldwide literature. Extended pelvic lymphadenectomy increased the probability of detecting lymph node metastases in our community.</dc:description>
