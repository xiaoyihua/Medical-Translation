<dc:description xml:lang="en">Recognizing the confirmed efficacy of urokinase as a thrombolytic and proteolytic agent, we assess its usefulness in the treatment of multiloculated pleural effusion, empyema and hematoma as a substitute of other more invasive procedures. Treatment with urokinase was applied in 18 consecutive cases. Inclusion criteria were a well-placed thoracic probe that did not drain and a radiological image showing occupation. Patients were excluded if they had bronchial fistulas or hemothorax of less than 7 days duration. Effusion in the included cases had developed after pneumonia, after surgery or after trauma. Treatment lasted 3 to 4 days ant was considered effective or not based on the volume of liquid drained and on radiological evidence of change. The amount of liquid drained was highly variable (mean 1,282 and S.D. 1,224; range 100-3,975). Radiological change was considered completely satisfactory in 10 cases, with 6 patients continuing to show occupation of the costophrenic sinus with no clinical repercussions. Two patients died of causes unrelated to administration of the drug. There were two mild relapses that did not require a second round of treatment with urokinase. Patients were followed for a least 30 days after discharge and no new recurrences were detected. We have found urokinase to be a useful fibrinolytic agent for treating multiloculated effusion. Contraindications are few and therefore urokinase should be considered the first-choice treatment to be applied before other more invasive measures are taken.</dc:description>
