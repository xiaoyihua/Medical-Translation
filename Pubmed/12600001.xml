<dc:description xml:lang="en">The genetic variety of the Rhizobium isolates from acid and alkaline soils in the semiarid zone of Pernambuco state was evaluated through the use of 17 primers of arbitrary sequence. Amplified products were separated by electrophoresis in agarose gel at 1.4% and visualized by ethidium bromide coloration. The results obtained suggest a high genetic variety of the isolates in relation to the standard strain. Data were analyzed by UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average), based on Jaccard's coefficient and visualized through dendrograms. The strains isolated from the acid soils were included in one group whereas the strains from alkaline soils were located in other three groups. Meanwhile, one of the groups formed by strain Isol-14, isolated from acid soils is more related to the groups of strains isolated from acid soils than to the remaining groups from alkaline soils.</dc:description>
