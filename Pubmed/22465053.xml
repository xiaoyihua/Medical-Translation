<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Ethnic differences are known to exist in the prevalence of diabetes, but little is known about possible differences in the degree of diabetes control among ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are differences in diabetes detection and control between immigrants and the autochthonous population in our health region. METHODS We performed a cross-sectional, observational, population-based study of all patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 registered and treated in 2010. We analyzed diabetes quality indicators and used multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex and number of visits. The adjustment method was forced and the absence of collinearity was identified through the ROC curve and Hosmer and Lemeshow's test. RESULTS There were 77,999 autochthonous patients (6,846 diabetics) and 30,748 immigrant patients (415 diabetics). A total of 8.78% of the autochthonous patients were diabetic versus 1.35% of immigrants (p &lt;0.001). HbA1c &lt;7.5% was found in 68.04% of the native population compared with 54.76% of immigrants. The probability of achieving optimal HbA1c control was 27% lower in immigrants (adjusted OR=0.73), while the probability of achieving good HbA1c control was 30% lower in the immigrant cohort. The model showed moderate discrimination (ROC =0.65 and Hosmer and Lemeshow's contrast, p&gt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS Diabetes control and quality indicators are poorer in some immigrant groups.</dc:description>
