<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ovarian ectopic pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy, with an estimated incidence ranging from 0.5% to 3% of the extrauterine pregnancies. For a correct diagnosis of the ovarian pregnancy, the traditional criteria proposed by Spiegelberg in 1878 must be fulfilled. This forced us sometimes to reject pregnancies which, despite being initially ovarian, during its evolution the adjacent tubal structures have been affected. Currently, the ectopic pregnancies are being diagnosed more early, mainly given the echographic advances, which have lead to very conservative treatments in order to avoid a reduced fertility. However, it is many times an intraoperative diagnosis. We present four new cases of ovarian ectopic pregnancy from our casuistry of the last three years with anatomoclinical study and literature review.</dc:description>
