<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To estimate the development degree to critical reading aptitude of clinical investigation papers among oncology residents. METHODS A transversal study with 40 oncology residents (surgical oncology, 17; medical oncology, 15; and radio-oncology, 8) was done. An instrument containing six abstracts of clinical articles selected according to a clinical purpose, methodological design and approach to the three most frequent malignancies in Mexico with 150 items to explore three critical reading aptitude indicators was constructed; experts validated it. A pilot test was done in 20 internal medicine residents; a Kuder-Richardson coefficient of 0.90 was obtained to estimate the internal reliability. The instrument was applied simultaneously. RESULTS The overall scores were low without difference among specialties (37.5, 35.5 and 38.0, respectively; maximum score: 150). According to indicators, the best score was observed to interpret and to treat, while the score to propose decreased in accordance with the higher specialty degree. CONCLUSIONS The aptitude development degree to critical reading among oncology residents was deficient. A better environment to develop a more critical and reflexive education should be considerated.</dc:description>
