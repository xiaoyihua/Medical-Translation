<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Patients with melanoma appear to take extreme sun-protection measures, which could influence 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. The aim of this study was to measure 25(OH)D levels in patients with cutaneous melanoma and identify factors associated with inadequate levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS Over a period of 1 year, we prospectively measured serum 25(OH)D in patients with cutaneous melanoma and used logistic regression analysis to identify environmental, phenotypic, and genotypic factors that were associated with insufficient and deficient levels. RESULTS Of 215 patients analyzed, 8.8% had deficient 25(OH)D levels (&lt;10ng/mL) and just 24.7% had normal levels. Insufficient levels (&lt;30ng/mL) were associated with obesity (odds ratio [OR], 4.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-13.3) and blood sampling in autumn/winter (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4). Deficient levels (&lt;10ng/mL) were associated with obesity (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 1.1-46.9), blood sampling in autumn/winter (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 1.7-47.0), absence of freckles (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.2-23.4), and, with marginal significance, the presence of fewer than 2 nonsynonymous melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) polymorphisms (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 0.9-28.9). LIMITATIONS Some factors related to 25(OH)D levels, such as food, were not included in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS 25(OH)D levels should be monitored in patients with melanoma and the need for oral supplements should be contemplated where appropriate.</dc:description>
