<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION There is a rich body of literature on the coexistence of diagnostic criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance abuse/dependence. Prevalence, however, varies considerably from one work to another. AIMS To apply an algorithm that takes into account all the criteria needed to reach an adequate diagnosis and to explore the conditions associated with false positives. PATIENTS AND METHODS The diagnostic algorithm was applied using several tests in the different phases, i.e. the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale was used for screening, the Wender-Utah Rating Scale and the Parents' Rating Scale were administered for the retrospective diagnosis, and the self-administered Spanish version of the frontal behaviour scale and the perceived stress scale were used to study false positives. Symptoms of other axis I disorders were also explored and a battery of classic neuropsychological tests was administered. All this was carried out with a sample of 696 subjects whose treatment began in a care centre for drug addicts. RESULTS The final prevalence was found to be 6.89%. The symptoms of the false positives in the screening test prior to consumption were similar to those of the true negatives, but in that moment those symptoms were similar to those of the true positives, with whom no differences were found in the neuropsychological performance. Generalised anxiety disorder was the one that showed the highest relation with false positives. CONCLUSIONS The diagnostic category of ADHD is usually utilised indiscriminately to classify subjects with early-onset neurological disorders and those who present similar manifestations following the phase of active addiction to substances. There is a need for a neurological and neuropsychological study that goes beyond the mere symptoms so as to be able to carry out a suitable characterisation and treatment of a set of similar symptomatic manifestations, but with a very wide range of developmental and aetiopathogenic components.</dc:description>
