<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To identify and analyze the most common causes for the discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy, including the co-formulation of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine (ABC-3TC-AZT). METHOD An observational, retrospective study was carried out on patients receiving antiretroviral therapy with ABC-3TC-AZT seen in the Pharmacy Department s outpatient unit from February 2002 through June 2004. The causes for discontinuation among patients withdrawing from this therapy were analyzed. Adherence was assessed using computerized dispensation records. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was designed in order to identify factors predictive of discontinuation. RESULTS In all, 114 patients (85 males, 74.6%) received this therapy - 25.4% of them were naïve patients - and 34.2% (39/114) withdrew from this regimen, amongst them 44.8% (13/29) of naïve subjects. In 92.3% of cases this happened before treatment week 48. Discontinuation causes included: adverse reactions (46.1%), voluntary discontinuation (33.3%), clinical decision (15.4%), and other reasons (5.1%). A possible hypersensitivity reaction to ABC was reported for 9 patients. A greater likelihood of discontinuation was associated with detectable viral load at therapy onset, ex-parenteral drug abuser status, and naïve status (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS A high percentage of discontinuations due to adverse events and voluntary withdrawal was found, particularly early during treatment. Patients who may therapeutically benefit from this regimen, particularly naïve subjects, should be identified, and interventions to improve adherence and optimize recovery parameters should be implemented.</dc:description>
