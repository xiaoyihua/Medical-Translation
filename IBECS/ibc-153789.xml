<dc:description xml:lang="es">Introduction. Coronary stenting for the treatment of ischemic heart disease is widespread and thus stents are frequently found in hearts at autopsy. Conventional methods of histological preparation cannot be used in stented coronaries and embedding in synthetic resins is required, which is expensive and time-consuming. In 2009, Bradshaw et al. described a method to dissolve metallic stents by electrolysis. The aim of this work is to present this method and the results obtained in our laboratory. Material and method. A power supply, a beaker with electrolytic solution, electrical wires, a metal ring, a stopper, a stainless steel spring and industrial grease are required. The method is based on an electrochemical reaction so that an electric current is created in a saline solution between a more electropositive metal (stent), which is oxidized (dissolves), and a more electronegative metal (ring), which is reduced. After dissolution the stented coronary is cut and embedded in paraffin. We have studied 60 stented coronaries from 54 hearts. Results. Metal dissolution was accomplished in all cases but one. In 54 a neointima was observed with empty holes left by the metal; in six, the stent imprint was observed in the intima and 3 showed occlusive thrombus. Conclusion. Stented coronary electrolysis is a simple, cheap and safe technique accessible to any Pathology Laboratory (AU)</dc:description>
