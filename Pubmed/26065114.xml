<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (thu) is the preferred method for the placement of a gastrostomy in children. In recent years a system to perform a button gastrostomy in one step has been designed (PEG-B). This system offers advantages over classical PEG although the potential risk of complications is greater. The aim of this paper is to present our experience with PEG-B. METHODS . Retrospective review of pediatric patients who have received the PEG-B system during 2013 in Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Pamna de Mallorca. Parameters analyzed included demographics, indications, feeding start, length of hospital stay and complications. RESULTS . A total of 8 patients, aged 8 months to 14 years, were included in the study. Indications were neurologic disease in 4 patients, metabolic disorders in 3 and tumors in 1. The weight range was 5.5 to 36 kg with a median of 12.4 kg. 16 Fr buttons were placed with length adjusted to each patient. The use of the gastrostomy started between 4-48 hours. The average length of hospital stay was 43.5 hours (24h-72h). There have been no major complications in 6 months follow up. A single pneumoperitoneum occurred postoperatively and two granulomas, one of them at one of the anchor points of the gastrostomy. CONCLUSIONS Although it is a small series, no major complications were found and results are comparable to results published in the surgical literature in both techniques. We believe that the PEG-B is a good choice for PEG placement in children.</dc:description>
