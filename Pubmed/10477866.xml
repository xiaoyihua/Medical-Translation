<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this brief paper, discussion focuses on options currently under consideration for the reform of the Spanish health care system. After a brief review, readers are advised, in view of the consequences of each option, to consider all the arguments in order to make fully informed decisions. Finally, it is proposed that, in view of what is known and unknown about the effects of different health care policy options, a research agenda be found that avoids both complacency and categorical affirmations regarding this complex topic. Arguments are roughly presented as an algorithm. Simplifications are made for the sake of clarity and the analysis is qualitative. Each nexus of the algorithm covers the most relevant aspects of the economic and health care issues that each alternative involves. In the author's opinion, these points should be kept in mind when making decisions.</dc:description>
