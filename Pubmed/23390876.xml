The APN is a nurse who has acquired a basis of expert knowledge, skills for decision making, and clinical competencies for an extended practice. In Spain, due to the Bologna process and the changes within university, such as postgraduate training, these profiles have begun to emerge. OBJECTIVE To describe the experience on the implementation of the advanced clinical nursing role in an inpatient oncology unit.

For this purpose, the change project "Design of a care program for patients carrying a permanent draining catheter for malign ascitis and pleural effusion" was implemented. The project was grounded on the evidence-based theory and practice, and focused on the patient and the family. Its implementation has enabled the development of competences by the APN and the identification of barriers and facilitators. CONCLUSIONS The changes that have taken place in society favor the development of new nursing profiles, which have a positive impact on the institutions, nursing practitioners, patients and families.</dc:description>
