<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM Describe levels of depression, anxiety and stress among users of an urban/rural health centre, analyse sex differences and comorbidity between depression, anxiety and stress. METHOD Descriptive co-relational study with a Portuguese version of DASS-21; consecutive sample (n=343). RESULTS 40.52%, 43.48% and 45.06% of individuals present some degree of depression, anxiety and of stress, respectively. Severe or very severe levels of disturbance were found in 20.87% (anxiety), 22.38% (stress) and 12.24% (depression) of individuals. Women present higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Depression, Anxiety and Stress are strongly and positively associated. CONCLUSION These results show high point prevalence--higher than in other countries--and reveal differences in sex as well as comorbidity. They may allow for the development of a local and community intervention strategy for mental health promotion and disease prevention, particularly for women.</dc:description>
