<dc:description xml:lang="en">Three hundred thirty eight Latinamerican refugees living in Lund, Sweden, 51 that lived in Lund and were repatriated to Chile and 1132 Swedish subjects were interviewed using the survey of the Swedish National Statistics Institute. Data were analyzed using an unconditional logistic regression model, controlling possible confounders. Refugees living in Lund and repatriated to Chile considered their health as bad in a higher proportion than their Swedish counterparts, with an odds ratio of 3.48 (2.03-5.66) and 4.78 (2.1-10.25) respectively. Refugees and repatriated subjects had a higher risk of suffering long lasting illnesses with odds ratio of 2.84 and 2.64 respectively. It is concluded that there are great differences in life standards, housing and social relationships between Swedish people, Latinamerican refugees and repatriated individuals.</dc:description>
