<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Many studies establish an elevated frequency of sleep disorders. The prevalence during life is of 35%. This situation has lead to develop a great number of instruments with the intention to evaluate better these alterations. Nevertheless, the majority lacks a suitable and national validation. Buysse et al designed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) considered the most able instrument to establish the quality of the sleep. This has been used and validated widely. Nor it exists a version validated to the Castilian for Colombia, nor similar instruments that allow making studies in sleep. AIM Validation of the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index in Colombia (ICSP-VC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS Experts consensus for face validity, pilots studies for evaluating understanding of the questionnaire, with double interview method. Evaluation of internal consistency. RESULTS. Internal consistency was Cronbach's alpha = 0.78. There were different scores between subjects that mentioned some subjective sleep disturbance (U Mann Whitney z = -5.635, p = 0.000), between them that qualify as 'so bad' or not their sleep quality (U Mann Whitney z = -2.90, p = 0.0037), between they that were consuming or not, habitually hypnotics (U Mann Whitney z = -4.289, p = 0.0000) and between they that referred conciliation insomnia or not (U Mann Whitney z = -4.769, p = 0.0000). There were clinical differences in ICSP-VC scores between adult older and younger (U Mann Whitney z = -1.926, p = 0.0542). There were not differences by gender. Subjects with extreme values scores had clinical differences with others. CONCLUSIONS ICSP-VC is a valid version of PQSI useful for studying sleep disorders.</dc:description>
