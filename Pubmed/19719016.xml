<dc:description xml:lang="en">The present investigation deals with the optimization of a cookie formulation based on deffated chilean hazel nut flour (DCHF) and quinoa flour (QF) characterized for being gluten free resources, aimed to increment the nutritional options of the celiac population using Taguchi methodology. Four independent variables DCHF, QF, ammonium bicarbonated (AB) and baking time (BT) at three levels each one were considered in orden to evaluate their effects on the sensory quality (SQ) and signal to noise ratio (S/N) of the optimized product. To determine the optimun levels and relative magnitude of the effects of each parameter L9 3(4) orthogonal array with nine design points and two replications each totalizing eighteen experimental runs was used. Results were analyzed using differences between the average values of each factor according to the working level and also analysis of variance (ANOVA). The desired characteristics were the maxima SQ and S/R responses, so Taguchi "the larger the better" performance formula was used. Optimun conditions turn out to be DCHF 24.3%; QF 7.1%; AB 0.6%; BT 22 minutes. Among the chemical characteristics highlighted components such as protein (8.9%) and fiber (12.7%). Regarding the prolamine content of 1.5 ppm its result was under the limit considered for CODEX (20 ppm) classifying this product as gluten free. On the other hand, the shelf life study expressed as conjugated dienes (CD) was 3.6% after 45 days at 30 degrees C storage conditions proving this product is stable to rancidness. Hedonic test data shown 100% approval, splitted as follow 75% (like very much) and 25% (like). Finally 100% of celiac peoples inquired in this study were well disposed to buy this product.</dc:description>
