<dc:description xml:lang="en">Experience at the Hospital del Niño IMAN in choledochus cysts is reviewed in 13 patients with ages ranging from 3 months to 13 years. Nine were female patients and four were male. Seven cases were managed with cystoduodenostomy and six with cystojejunostomy using Roux's Y operation. Two patients from the cystoduodenostomy group died probably due to the serious hepatic lesion present before surgery and not to the surgical procedure itself. There were no deaths in the group with cystojejunostomy using Roux's Y operation and all patients are asymptomatic at 6 months to 5 years after surgery. Stress is made on the high incidence of cases in our country. Disadvantages of cystoduodenostomy due to the reflux of food contents of the biliary ducts, documented in these cases, are discussed. The possibility of a complete cyst resection is considered, based on reports of late malignancies and poor functioning of the anastomoses mentioned by other authors.</dc:description>
