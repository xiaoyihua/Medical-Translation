<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Group therapy (GT) is widely used in the treatment of alcoholism. Nevertheless, few data are available on the inclusion criteria for specific individual, as well as on specific group, techniques for the management of some types or groups of patients with homogeneous characteristics. METHOD Compliance with group therapy has been analyzed in a sample of 459 alcoholics under 36 years of age, 303 of whom were placed in specific GT for young people (Y groups) and 156 were allocated in standard GT (NY) groups. RESULTS Similar rates of discharge (16.8% vs 18.6%), withdrawals and drop-outs (63.4% vs 61.5%) of patients have been found in both groups. No differences were found in the survival function of time of compliance adjusted for gender and age (Y: 27.2%, and NY: 33.3% at one year, and Y: 18.4%, and NY: 21% at 2 years). CONCLUSIONS There is no scientific evidence to support the use of Y groups in the treatment of young alcoholics. On the other hand, the possibility still exists that the use of groups with composition, techniques and specific objectives may provide improvement in compliance and in the therapeutic results as long as they adequately identify the characteristics of the patients who may benefit from a homogeneous treatment.</dc:description>
