<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Cycads are ornamental plants that in some parts of the world are used as fresh food or raw material for producing flour with a high nutritional value. However, they also contain active compounds, including methylazoxymethanol, β-methylamino-L-alanine, β-alanine-L-oxalylamino and cycasin, which may produce neurotoxic effects. Some studies have associated consuming cycads and their derivatives with neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/Parkinsonism dementia complex, and other diseases characterised by motor impairment. Therefore, we must not forget that any product, no matter how natural, may present health risks or benefits depending on the chemical compounds it contains and the susceptibility of those who consume it. DEVELOPMENT We completed a literature analysis to evaluate the neurotoxic properties of cycads and their association with neurological diseases in order to provide structured scientific information that may contribute to preventing health problems in people who use these plants. CONCLUSION Cycads contain neurotoxic compounds that may contribute to the development of neurological diseases when ingested improperly. We must be mindful of the fact that while some plants have a high nutritional value and may fill the food gap for vulnerable populations, they can also be toxic and have a negative impact on health.</dc:description>
