<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Early diagnosis of diabetes mellitus complications reduces their progression and therefore improves quality of life and decreases cardiovascular mortality. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficiency of a unit for detection of chronic complications of diabetes, and to analyze the incidence and prevalence of complications in a sample of patients from our area of interest and concern. METHODS A cross-sectional study performing routine screening of all diabetes complications in patients aged 18-80 years diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus at least 6 months before. Anthropometric variables were measured and data on drug treatment and the most recent lipid profile were collected. RESULTS 460 patients were included in the study. The prevalence and incidence rates of chronic complications of diabetes were 57% and 35.4% respectively. Glycosylated hemoglobin values ≤ 7% were found in 42% of patients, blood pressure levels below 130/80 mmHg in 20% of patients, and LDL cholesterol levels less than 2.59 mmol/L in 46% of patients. Patients with new complications were older and had higher BMI and hip circumference values, as well as higher systolic blood pressure levels and greater use of antihypertensive drugs. CONCLUSION A unit for routine screening of chronic complications of diabetes would allow for detection of macroangiopathy and microangiopathy in a single annual visit, increasing visit compliance, and for implementation of measures to prevent its progression.</dc:description>
