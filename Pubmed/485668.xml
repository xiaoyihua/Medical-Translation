<dc:description xml:lang="en">There were studied 14 patients with congestive myocardiopathy demonstrated by cardiac catheterism at nine, echocardiogramme at five and/or necropsy at four. There were registered mytral insufficiency blowings at thirteen and tricusp insufficiency blowings at five. Of them, there were 11 that presented pathologic noises III and IV. Right apexcardiogramme showed growth of such cavity at the twelve patients that were studied. "a" index of the same precordiogramme had qualitative correlation with systolic pulmonary pression. Apexcardiogramme showed ventricular growth at twelve from thirteen patients and "a" index was also qualitatively correlated with direct deermination of the left ventricule's telediastolic pression. Chronocardiometry was anormal at all of them. Short expulsive period, long pre-expulsive period, expulsion's fraction diminution reckoned by this method and systolic quotient, all of them diminished, translated the cardiac expense fall by "pump" fail. Elongation of pre-isosystolic phase, isosystolic phase, true isosystolic phase, and diminution of ventricular pression's elevation middle velocity and contractility index were consequences of myocardic contraction's bad quality. Decrement of ventricular pression's elevation velocity, added to the important elevation of left ventricle's final diastolic pression determined the "pseudonormality" of IIa-0 interval, and of the integrated isovolumetric pression. Shortening of fast filled's phase is explained by a minor ventricular filled in order to the volume's increase and diastolic pression's increase (Board VII). By last, shortening of Q-IIa interval, coinciding with the cardiac frecuence's increase is explained by catecolamins' increased secretion like compensating mechanism of chronic cardiac insufficiency. Phonomechanocardiogramme is useful for entity's diagnostic and it informs about ventricular disfunction which characterise the suffering.</dc:description>
