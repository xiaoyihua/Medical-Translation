<dc:description xml:lang="en">Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease that usually affects women, with a male:female ratio of 1:4-10. It was thought that there was a prohibitive risk of fatal complications in the pregnancies of patients with SSc. It is now known that the majority of these women undergo a normal progression of pregnancy if the right time is chosen and a close obstetric care is delivered. The obstetric risk will depend on the subtype and clinical stage of the disease, and the presence and severity of the internal organ involvement during the pregnancy. The management of these pregnancies should be provided in a specialized center, with a multidisciplinary team capable of identifying and promptly treating complications. Treatment should be limited to drugs with no teratogenic potential, except when renal crises or severe cardiovascular complications develop.</dc:description>
