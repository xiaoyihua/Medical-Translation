<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The utility of the nonsurgical correction of congenital auricular deformities by ear molding and splinting has been previously established. Occasionally, its application cannot be easy, and the later collaboration of the parents is necessary. We report a new method of splinting that simplifies the procedure. DESIGN prospective, case series. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty ears in 15 patients between 7 and 60 days of age (average 22 days) were treated. They were 12 prominent ears, 4 Stahl's ears, 2 lop ears, 1 Crinkled ear, and 1 case of increase of antihelix folder. Cotton impregnated with 2-Octyl-Cyanoacrylate is placed as splint for 6 weeks. RESULTS The bilateral application lasted less than 5 minutes, end there were no spills to the external auditory canal. The splint was given off to the 2 weeks, and a second procedure was necessary in all the cases. There were no dermatitis or skin ulcers. The treatment was successful in 11 cases, partial improvement in 3, poor correction in 4, and recurrence in 2. CONCLUSIONS The splint therapy is an easy nonsurgical method for the treatment of congenital auricular deformities that applied during the first weeks of life provides good aesthetic results in more than 50% of the patients.</dc:description>
