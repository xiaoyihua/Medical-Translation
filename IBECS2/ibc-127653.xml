<dc:description xml:lang="es">Objective: To review and analyze the evidence on the effectiveness of different physiotherapy techniques in reducing the volume of lymphedema associated with lymphadenectomy and to assess the improvement of the concomitant symptoms and their impact on health-related quality of life. Search strategy and study selection: A search in PubMed, PEDro and Cinahl databases was conducted completing the process with a hand search. A total of 53 papers were identified and 14 randomized clinical trials which met the inclusion criteria were included. Methodology quality was evaluated with the Jadad scale, 10 randomized clinical trials being considered as was acceptable and 4 were deficient. Synthesis of results: Different therapeutic modalities were used in the treatment of lymphedema: Manual lymphatic drainage, exercises therapy, pneumatic compression, compression bandage, Kinesiotaping, hydrotherapy, low-frequency and low-intensity electrotherapy. Manual lymphatic drainage is the technique that had the greatest efficacy. This effectiveness increased when combined with others, for example, with pneumatic compression or compression bandage. The results on the kinesiotaping, hydrotherapy or low-frequency and low-intensity electrotherapy are not conclusive. Conclusion: Some physiotherapy techniques are effective in the treatment of lymphedema to reduce volume, decrease pain, improve health-related quality of life and functionality of patients (AU)</dc:description>
