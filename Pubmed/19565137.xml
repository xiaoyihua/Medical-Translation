<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND When a dobutamine stress echocardiogram is performed, piloerection is frequently found in the scalp area. OBJECTIVE The aim of the present study was to establish the incidence of this phenomenon and its association with other clinical findings. METHODS A total of 218 consecutive patients that underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography in our department were included in the study. RESULTS Piloerection was present in 42.2% of the sample. No correlations could be established between piloerection and gender, result of the stress test or other side effects. A statistically significant correlation was established with the age of the patients: piloerection was present in 73% of patients aged 50 years or younger. It appears most often with a dobutamine dose of 10 microg/kg/min. CONCLUSION Piloerection is a frequent side effect of dobutamine infusion, particularly in patients aged 50 or less; it usually precedes the increase in heart rate caused by dobutamine; therefore, it is an early and clear indication that the intravenous set is working properly. Also, the previous warning of its possible appearance may contribute to the patient's well-being.</dc:description>
