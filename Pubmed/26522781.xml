<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the acceptability of opportunistic search for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). DESIGN Cross-sectional, observational study. LOCATION Primary Care Centres (PCC) of the Spanish National Health Care System. PARTICIPANTS patients aged 18 to 65 years who had never been tested for HIV, and were having a blood test for other reasons. RECORDED VARIABLES: age, gender, stable partner, educational level, tobacco/alcohol use, reason for blood testing, acceptability of taking the HIV test, reasons for refusing to take the HIV test, and reasons for not having taken an HIV test previously. A descriptive, bivariate, multivariate (logistic regression) statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS A total of 208 general practitioners (GPs) from 150 health care centres recruited 3,314 patients. Most (93.1%) of patients agreed to take the HIV test (95%CI: 92.2-93.9). Of these patients, 56.9% reported never having had an HIV test before because they considered not to be at risk of infection, whereas 34.8% reported never having been tested for HIV because their doctor had never offered it to them. Of the 6.9% who refused to take the HIV test, 73.9% considered that they were not at risk. According to the logistic regression analysis, acceptability was positively associated to age (higher among between 26 and 35 year olds, OR=1.79; 95%CI: 1.10-2.91) and non-smokers (OR=1.39; 95%CI: 1.01-1.93). Those living in towns with between 10,000 and 50,000 inhabitants showed less acceptance to the test (OR=0.57; 95%CI: 0.40-0.80). The HIV prevalence detected was 0.24% CONCLUSIONS Acceptability of HIV testing is very high among patients having a blood test in primary care settings in Spain. Opportunistic search is cost-effective.</dc:description>
