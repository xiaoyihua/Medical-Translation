<dc:description xml:lang="en">We studied the prevalence of risk factors and related cardiovascular complications in 403 patients with periferal arterial disease (PAD) arising from atherosclerosis. The control group was made up of 126 patients of the same age and sex and without PAD. The average age was 66.9 +/- 12 years, and the percentage of men was 80%. Among the male subjects, smoking, the presence of diabetes, total cholesterol count, and age were the prevalent risk factors, even after logistic regression analysis. Among women, only smoking and diabetes showed significant differences. Among both sexes, the prevalence of arterial hypertension was similar to that of the controls. Greater prevalence of related cardiovascular complications was found only in men. We conclude that for PAD, smoking and diabetes are the most important cardiovascular risk factors, with total cholesterol level being an important additional factor in men.</dc:description>
