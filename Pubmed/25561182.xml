<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE To describe the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and to compare it with that observed in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and normal population in Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS Cross-sectional study (18-70 years-old). Information on CVD was available from a nurse-administered questionnaire (Di@bet.es Study, NORMAL=3,430, T2DM=312) and from a physician reporting form (T1DM=1,382). Differences in the crude and adjusted prevalence of coronary heart (CHD), cerebrovascular (CNSD), peripheral vascular (PVD) and overall CV (CVD) disease were investigated between T1DM vs. NORMAL, and T1DM vs. T2DM groups. RESULTS We found differences in age, body mass index, proportion of women, dyslipemia and antihypertensive medication between T1DM vs. NORMAL and T1DM vs. T2DM (all P&lt;.001). Smoking prevalence was not different between T1DM vs. T2DM and it was lower in T1DM compared to NORMAL (P&lt;.0001). The percentage of CHD, CNSD, PVD, and overall CVD in T1DM vs. NORMAL was 3.0 vs. 2.5 (P=.31), 0.70 vs. 1.10 (P=.22), 2.61 vs. 0.20 (P&lt;.0001), and 5.1 vs. 3.44 (P&lt;.01), respectively. The prevalence in T2DM (vs. T1DM) was 11.3 (P&lt;.0001), 3.5 (P&lt;.0001), 4.2 (P=.13), and 17% (P&lt;.0001), respectively. Multiple logistic regression adjusted models showed a higher prevalence of CHD (odds ratio [OR] 2.27, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.41-3.67), PVD (OR 15.35, 95% CI 5.61-42.04), and overall CVD (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.55-3.46), but not for CNSD (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.19-1.27) in T1DM compared to NORMAL. No differences were found between T1DM and T2DM. CONCLUSIONS We found a higher prevalence of CVD in a Mediterranean population of T1DM individuals compared with non-diabetic subjects. This prevalence was similar to that observed in T2DM.</dc:description>
