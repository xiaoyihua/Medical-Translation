<dc:description xml:lang="en">Few clinical studies have dealth with annihilation, entrainment and modulation of ventricular parasystolic rhythm. Parasystolic modulation was diagnosed in 9 nonmedicated patients because single, nonparasystolic beats falling during the initial 59% of the cycle prolonged the parasystolic cycle length (by 12 to 37.5%), whereas those that fell later in the cycle shortened it (by 9 to 25%). Plotting this prolongation or shortening as a function of the temporal position of the nonparasystolic beats in the cycle, yielded biphasic response curves. In two patients, episodes of concealed one-to-one entrainment were initiated by late nonparasystolic (sinus) beats and, later on, terminated by early ventricular extrasystoles. In 2 other patients, (and in 2 separate occasions) nonparasystolic beats, falling in part of the cycle located in between those of maximal delay and acceleration, produced pacemaker annihilation (cessation of automatic activity for the remaining monitoring time). Parasystolic annihilation and concealed entrainment may be one of the causes that can explain the large, spontaneous, day-to-day variability in the incidence of ectopic ventricular beats reported in Holter recordings.</dc:description>
