<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To analyse complications in the catheterization of the internal jugular vein using the Boulanger technique and to establish a rating of difficulty and risk when the procedure is carried out by physicians in training. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a prospective study of 296 internal jugular vein (IJV) catheterizations by the Boulanger technique carried out by physicians in training (group R2 and group R3-4) or by departmental staff physicians (group staff). Time taken for venous catheterization, rate of success and complications were recorded for each physician performing the procedure. RESULTS The complication most often observed (11.4%) was puncture of the carotid artery (14.3% group R2, 10% group R3-4 and 8.2% staff), followed by arrhythmia upon insertion of the metal guide (1.6%). There were no instances of pneumothorax or hemothorax, nor any other of the early complications considered infrequent. Success ranged from 68.8% for group R2 to 85.7% for staff. Mean time used in group R2 was 238.7 seconds, while for staff it was 118.3 seconds. CONCLUSION We suggest that the Boulanger technique for catheterization of the internal jugular vein is a good one and is not particularly hazardous when performed by resident physicians in training.</dc:description>
