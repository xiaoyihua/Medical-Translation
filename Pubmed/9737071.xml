<dc:description xml:lang="en">The intra-uterine device TCu 380 (IUD) has a great acceptance among the group of women that take the fertility control in not definitive form and it is being accepted by more women. In spite of the simple technique to insert the IUD, the people in charge of the planning family program in the first level attention section of the centers of health, have not enough knowledge for its insertion. We reported the case of a 21 year old woman that applied the IUD immediately after her baby's birth and she had sudden expulsion the following week. She went to the first level attention section where they inserted the IUD again and four months later she began to have urinary symptoms and abdominal pain, she went for a check, but could not find the filaments of the IUD. The x-ray of her abdomen showed an inverted IUD, they tried to take it off, but without any success. She was sent to the General Hospital where made an ultrasound that showed the IUD in the urinary bladder. A transurethral endoscopy was made and also an ultrasonographic dragging without gerring it. That is why decided to take it off by abdominal and urinary bladder surgery. The IUD was inserted transurethral which the diameter of the applier is thin and lets it go free in thorough the urethra, besides that during the operation did not find any harm in the uterus or the bladder that could make suspect the perforation in order to make the IUD reach the urinary bladder. The above mention demonstrate the ignorance of the technique and the anatomic place for the insertion of the IUD. That is the reason why it is necessary a more detailed preparation it the whole personnel assigned to the family planning programs.</dc:description>
