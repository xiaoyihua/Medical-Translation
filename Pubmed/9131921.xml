<dc:description xml:lang="en">From January 1993 to December 1994, 9 patients (median age 40 years, range 29-71) were evaluated for sudden hearing loss at the Valme de Sevilla University Hospital, Spain. All had severe or profound initial hearing loss, which was bilateral in 3 (33%) cases. Total deafness affected 5 (41%) ears. All subjects were treated with a 3-day course of intravenous piracetam, 10 g/day diluted in 250 ml of saline solution and administered in a 15-minute intravenous infusion. No side effects occurred. The parameters examined were age, sex, side of lesion, contralateral hearing status, time from onset of symptoms to admission, vestibular symptoms, tinnitus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, initial hearing loss, and audiogram configuration. After treatment, 6 (50%) ears showed improved hearing. Eight (89%) patients had vestibular symptoms, and 5 (55%) reported tinnitus.</dc:description>
