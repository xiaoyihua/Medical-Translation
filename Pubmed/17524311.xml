<dc:description xml:lang="en">Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has become a very useful tool for monitoring Hodgkin's disease patients in the last years. When there is suspicion of disease persistence after treatment, this technique makes it possible to evaluate treatment activity of the residual lesions observed in the CT scan. Furthermore, due to the whole body study, new tumor sites, which very often change the therapeutic option, can be detected. We must take into account, however, that 18F-FDG is a very sensitive but not very specific tumor marker, since some inflammatory or infectious conditions may be associated to significant radiopharmaceutical uptakes. Thus, in order to increase specificity it is mandatory to correlate the PET information with the rest of the conventional imaging and clinical data and evolution of the patient. We present the case of a woman with Hodgkin's disease in which 18F-FDG PET was included in the follow-up. Both conditions, tumor and infection, were present in different times of the course. The integration of all the x-ray, clinical, laboratory and metabolic information allowed for a better and correct management of this patient.</dc:description>
