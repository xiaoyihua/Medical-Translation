<dc:description xml:lang="en">An analysis was performed to estimate mortality and YPLL attributable to 20 smoking related diseases, based on the prevalence rates of current and former smokers obtained from a national survey; mortality data from vital statistics, and their relative risks and attributable mortality fractions due to tobacco consumption of the 20 diagnoses set for 1986. Numerical estimates of national mortality and YPLL attributable to cigarette consumption for the diagnosis set were made. Among the population of 20 years of age and older on 1986, a total of 17,405 deaths where attributable to smoking cases (47.0/100,000 individuals of 20 to 74 years of age), and takes the 9th place of grouped general mortality. Cardiovascular disease rated first place with 33 per cent of total cases; respiratory disease came second with 31.6 per cent. All 20 diagnoses someans 146.299 YPLL between 20 to 65 years (1.4 per cent from total ypll 0-70 years).</dc:description>
