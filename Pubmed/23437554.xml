<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION in dengue outbreaks or epidemics, the chemical pesticides play a fundamental role to control disease-borne adult mosquitoes and to support the Vector Control program in Cuba. OBJECTIVES to find out the effectiveness and the efficiency of insecticidal formulations in use for the control of Aedes aegypti mosquito in three strains from the City of Havana. METHODS bioassays followed the methodology recommended by the World Health Organization. Efficacy and efficiency were compared in the studied insecticides between the cold spraying and the thermal spraying. A standardization test was applied to verify the nature of each variable; one three-factor ANOVA to see any differences among the mortality means and the Kruskal-Wallis test to find out difference among the mortality values for each type of treatment with respect to the preparation of one liter of mixture (efficiency), for a significance level of p &lt; 0,05. RESULTS when comparing the mortality figures reached with both types of treatment, it was evinced that there was a highly significant difference between them, the most favourable results corresponded to thermal spraying, which proved the efficacy of this treatment and its efficiency (effectiveness/cost). CONCLUSIONS there exists a highly significant difference between the formulations, which favors Galgothrin 25 EC.</dc:description>
