<dc:description xml:lang="en">Peripheral ossifying fibroma, a reactive gingival disorder known under the generic term of epulis, is widely considered to originate from the cells of the periodontal ligament. A 39-year-old woman presented with a well circumscribed, hard pedunculated exophytic tumor measuring 2 cm in size, without ulceration. The lesion had developed three months before in the interdental space, between the lower left lateral incisor and canine. No radiological signs of involvement of the alveolar ridge were observed, and the clinically manifest diastema was confirmed. The histological study of the specimen after simple resection with a cold scalpel confirmed the diagnosis of peripheral ossifying fibroma. The patient posteriorly suffered three recurrences that were respectively treated via simple resection, carbon dioxide laser exeresis and finally wide resection including the periodontal ligament, periosteum and underlying bone. There have been no further recurrences following wide resection. In addition to presenting this new case of peripheral ossifying fibroma, the present study reviews the literature, comments on the predisposing factors and treatment options, and suggests the importance of this disorder in the differential diagnosis of gingival lesions.</dc:description>
