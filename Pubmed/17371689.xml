<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Stapedectomy is currently the treatment with which the best results are obtained among patients with otosclerosis, which is why it is the treatment of choice. OBJECTIVE The objective of our paper is to evaluate the auditory results of patients diagnosed with this illness who were subjected to surgery. MATERIAL AND METHOD The study population comprised all patients attending the otosurgery clinic with a diagnosis of otosclerosis and who were selected to undergo stapedectomy treatment with the Schuknecht technique between June 2003 and June 2005. RESULTS Our sample contained 44 patients, 3 of whom received bilateral treatment, for a total of 47 operated ears. 70.2 % were women and men the remaining 29.8 %, between the 3rd and 5th decades of life. Partial platinectomy was done in 53.2 % of the patients, total platinectomy in 40.4 %, and platinostomy in 6.4 %. CONCLUSION The conclusion of our study is that all the patients who received surgical treatment had an auditory improvement of 36.7 dB on average and there was no significant difference in the type of platinectomy performed. Complications were rare and with no auditory repercussions.</dc:description>
