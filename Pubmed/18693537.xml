<dc:description xml:lang="en">RATIONALE Olea europaea (olive) which is original from Europe, was introduced to Mexico by the Spaniards in the 16th century. In 1777 olive farming was prohibited, and plantations were destroyed. At present there are only few trees in Southern Mexico City. The aim of this study is to investigate sensitization to Olea europaea, clinical features, IgE levels, and concurrent pollen sensitizations in a group of Mexican patients. METHOD A retrospective chart review of all patients (n=232) with pollen allergy, between August 2003 and August 2004, in a medical office. RESULTS The sensitization to Olea europaea was found in 41.5% (96). The median IgE levels was 387.2 UI/ml. Symptoms were: 95.8% with allergic rhinitis, 58.3% asthma, 66.6% chronic sinusitis, 36.4% otitis media with effusion, 29.1% allergic conjunctivitis, 16.6% atopic dermatitis, 16.6% oral allergy syndrome, mainly related to apple and strawberries; and 4.5% paranasal polyposis. Positive skin prick tests to Olea europaea were higher on April (27.2%), and lower on November (2.5%). CONCLUSION Olea europaea is an important sensitizer in Mexico City. Cross-reaction to other pollens belonging to Oleaceae family, possibly Osmanthus americanus, could explain monosensitization to olive tree.</dc:description>
