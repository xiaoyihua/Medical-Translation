<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To present our surgical experience in laparoscopic adrenalectomy after 70 procedures, comparing our results with the published series and analyzing the learning curve. METHODS Between June 1997 and December 2007 we performed 87 adrenalectomies (70 transperitoneal laparoscopy, 1 retroperitoneoscopy and 16 open surgery); 60% were female. Mean age was 54 years 15-80); 35 were left adrenalectomies, 33 right and one bilateral. Mean mass size was 3,7 cm (1-10). All patients were assessed regarding the following variables: preoperative diagnosis, histopathology, operative time, blood loss, complications, conversion to open surgery and hospital stay. We compared the results of the first 40 surgical procedures (Group 1) and the last 30 (Group 2). We also compared our re-sults with published series. Mean time follow-up was 12 months (2-60). RESULTS The most frequent preoperative diagnoses were: active suprarenal mass (50%), incidentaloma (20%), pheochromocytoma (20%). Histopathology confirmed 60% adenomas, 14% pheochromocytomas and 11% cortical nodular hyperplasia. Mean operative time was 161 minutes (60-300). Average blood loss (hematocrit) was 5.2 (1-10). Conversion and complication rate were 8.5 and 7%, respectively. Mean hospital stay was 4 days (2-30). In group 2, only reduction on mean operative time (120 min) and hospital stay (3 days) was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS Transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy is a feasible and safe procedure in urological groups with previous laparoscopic experience. Our results are similar to the published series and confirm the efficacy, safety and reproducibility of this technique.</dc:description>
