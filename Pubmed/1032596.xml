<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors studied an enzymatic activity (BAME-esterase) from human plasma, intimately related with the bradykinin release mechanisms. The optimal conditions of evaluation of the different plasmas were determined. Lately, the authors showed the results obtained with plasma from maternal peripheral blood, umbilical vessels blood and human placental intervillous space blood. It was concluded: 1. The study of enzymatic kinetics allows to establish a reaction time of 30 minutes, and the enzymatic concentration contained within 0.5 ml. of plasma, as ideal parameters to determine the enzymatic activities into the different compartments. 2. In the cases studied, considered clinically normals, the enzymatic activity in plasma from the interveillous space, before and after the detachment of the placenta, was greater than in peripheral maternal and umbilical vessels bloods. The activity in umbilical artery plasma was greater than in umbilical vein and practically the same as in maternal plasma. 3. The esterase activity values into the compartments studied in pre-eclamptics, were similar to that found in the cases considered clinically normal.</dc:description>
