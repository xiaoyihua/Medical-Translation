<dc:description xml:lang="en">We studied 30 ambulatory patients with mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension, treated with the new calcium antagonist nitrendipine, during a follow-up period of six months and after a three week placebo period was completed. Nitrendipine initial dosage was 20 mg, given once daily in the morning. Normalization of blood pressure was achieved in every patient after three months of treatment, with a p less than 0.0001 since the first month and throughout the whole period. No concomitant changes in heart rate or vascular risk factors were observed. Eight patients needed their individual dosages to be doubled (40 mg) to achieve a complete normalization of their blood pressure values; four of them took the whole dosage once daily. We had to stop treatment in three patients because of significant worsening of previous symptoms. Although there was a 16.6% total incidence of secondary effects, the compliance was over 90%, which tells us about the relatively small importance of secondary effects observed. Flushing, which was present in five patients, was the most common secondary effect. Nitrendipine is an excellent antihypertensive drug, easy to use and responsible for a low number of disabling secondary effects, usually appearing in previously very symptomatic patients.</dc:description>
