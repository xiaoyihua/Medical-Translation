<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Training in major trauma management is increasingly important in our country and throughout the world in general, but there is great uncertainty about who treats these patients in our country and how do surgical residents obtain experience in evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of these patients. OBJECTIVE To find out, from surgery residents, the current state of their training and knowledge of major trauma patient care in our country, and their opinions on how to improve it. At the same time, to analyse whether major trauma patient care in our hospitals has changed in recent years, along with the factors that may influence teaching in how to manage these patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD A survey was sent with a pre-paid envelope to 78 university hospitals accredited for resident training, during the period from March to October 2005. RESULTS When comparing traditional care of major trauma patients with that of the last 5 years there were no statistically significant differences (p = 0.77). The fact that the hospital is a referral centre for trauma care of trauma does not significantly affect whether the resident feels well-trained (p = 0.7), or well-informed (p = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS General surgery residents do not feel well-trained or well-informed on the management of major trauma patients despite working in hospitals that treat these patients and an increasing number of surgeons are involved in the trauma. There are few lines of research into multiple trauma, despite the linkage with university centres.</dc:description>
