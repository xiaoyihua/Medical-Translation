<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Single-port transumbilical laparoscopically assisted appendectomy (TULAA) has become the preferred method of treating appendicitis in our Department. At first, it was reserved for noncomplicated cases, and gradually for the rest of them. We have gained experience, and it is time to share it, evaluate the results and raise into new possibilities. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a retrospective statistical analysis of undergone changes over the last years, referring to aspects such as surgical indications, andpostoperative complications, hospital stays and re-admissions. RESULTS From September 2003 to January 2012, a total of 1,022 appendectomies were performed. Eight hundred and forty-one children underwent TULAA, 89.65% were completed with no problems. In 179 patients, open appendectomy was initially chosen. In those cases, the reasons were complicated appendicitis, obesity or surgeon's preference (43 in the first year and just 3 in the last one). Ninety seven patients had postoperative complications of any kind, fifteen were readmitted to the hospital and 3 were reoperated because of intestinal obstruction. Medical cost savings were estimated around 750.000 Euros. CONCLUSIONS We think that TULAA is a simple and easy learning procedure, which does not result in any increase in complications, inexpensive and beneficial for patients. However, along these years, our surgical staff may have lost skills and training opportunities in conventional laparoscopic surgery. So although TULAA is still our preferred method in appendicectomy, selected cases will undergo laparoscopic appendectomy.</dc:description>
