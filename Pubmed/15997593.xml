<dc:description xml:lang="en">Due to the advances of the perinatology, the hope of premature life of the big premature has been increased considerably in these last years. But for new factors that impact in their prevalence, this has increased, and mainly those that are born weighing less than 1.000 gr. In this work we present the results obtained in the service of obstetrics of the University General Hospital Gregorio Marañón. The prevalence has oscilated between 6 and 19/1000 of the attended childbirths that add 34.364 between 1995 and 2003, being the stocking the 11,88/1000. The factors that more impact in these oscilations are the pregnancy after attended fecundation, the population of immigrant women, the premature break of membranes, the not controlled pregnancy and the pathological pregnancy. The fetal survival below the week 25 are still low, around 15%, and later on, when the fetus has reached the 750 gr., it ascends abruptly above 70%, coming closer to 90% in the week 28. The protocol of our attendance is described excused to obtain these results.</dc:description>
