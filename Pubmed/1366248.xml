<dc:description xml:lang="en">We carried out a vaccine program against Hepatitis B in scholar population aged 5 to 17 educated in 3 institutions of Madrid city/ region. Those children who followed the vaccination criteria (negative HBsAg and Anti HBc markers) were vaccinated. The vaccination regimen (Engerix B recombinant DNA vaccine) was 0-1-6 months and dose was 10 and 20 ug i.m. for those aged 6 to 13 and 13 to 17 respectively. The postvaccine serologic results (anti-HBs titer) was evaluated one month after tha last dose, at 7th month from the beginning. The variables of study were age and sex for each individual. Corresponding to these variables both seroconversion rate (percentage of patients with 10 Ul/l of-anti-HBs) and the geometric mean titer of antibodies (GMT anti-HBs titer) were determined. The overall seroconversion rate at 7th month was 99%. There is not significant association neither regarding the sex nor mean age between "responders" and "no responders". The titer of anti-HBs antibodies, expressed using the G.M.T., which was reached at 7th month was 9.283.2 UI/I. Finally, there is not correlation between age and anti-HBs antibody titer.</dc:description>
