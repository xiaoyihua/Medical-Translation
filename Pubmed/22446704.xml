<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND There is an association between arsenic exposure and prostatic cancer mortality. AIM To analyze and to compare the serum levels of total prostatic specific antigEn (TPSA) in asymptomatic men of a rural zone, exposed and not exposed to high concentrations of arsenic (As) in drinking water. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 161 men that were subjected to a clinical evaluation, serum TPSA determination and a trans rectal ultrasonography. Exposed and non-exposed subjects were divided in groups GA, GB and GC according to TPSA levels (&lt;4 ng/ml, 4.1-10 ng/ml and &gt;10.1 ng/ml respectively). RESULTS Exposed and non-exposed subjects had similar TPSA levels. Among exposed subjects, 88.2, 8,8 and 3% were ascribed to groups GA, GB and GC respectively. The figures for non-exposed subjects were 90. 6, 6,3 and 3,1%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for TPSA in exposed and non-exposed subjects was 0.64 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.40-0.9) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.6-0.8) respectively. CONCLUSIONS No differences in TPSA levels between subjects exposed and non-exposed to arsenic were observed in this study.</dc:description>
