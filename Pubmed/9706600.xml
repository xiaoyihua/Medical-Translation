<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The empiric antibiotic treatment of intraabdominal infections is in constant evolution. Monotherapy appears to be a desirable goal because of the simplicity of its administration, lack of toxic effects and wide spectrum. PATIENTS AND METHODS A multicentre, prospective, randomized, open study was carried out to compare two antibiotic regimens in the treatment of intraabdominal infections in patients undergoing surgery. Ninety-eight consecutive patients were randomly allocated into two groups. One group (GM, n = 51) received meropenem (1 g/8 h) and the other (GCM, n = 47) a combination of cefotaxime (2 g/8 h) plus metronidazol (0.5 g/8 h). Clinical and bacteriological responses were assessed at the end of treatment and at 2-4 weeks. RESULTS The severity of patients as assessed by the APACHE II score was similar in both groups (GM: 7.2 and GCM: 8.1). Three patients in each group could not be evaluated due to premature interruption of treatment or deviation from the protocol. The mean duration of treatment was 7.4 days in GM and 7.9 days in GCM. A satisfactory clinical response was obtained in 95% of patients in both groups. 31 patients (61%) in GM and 26 patients (55%) in GCM were bacteriologically evaluable. Bacteriological erradication was achieved in 94% of patients in GM and in 92% of patients in GCM. CONCLUSION Meropenem is a good alternative for single antibiotic therapy in intraabdominal infections of moderate severity.</dc:description>
