<dc:description xml:lang="en">The era of catheter ablation for the treatment of arrhythmias began in 1981 when Dr Scheinman performed the first atrioventricular junction ablation using direct current shocks in a patient with drug refractory atrial fibrillation and an uncontrolled ventricular rate. With the progress of radiofrequency catheter ablation, the range of arrhythmias amenable to catheter ablation and the number of patients that could be treated safely by this procedure expanded enormously. Lastly, although still in an evolutionary phase, catheter ablation to eliminate atrial fibrillation has been demostrated in the past years to be feasible and clinically useful. On the other hand, innovations in technology and pharmacology, and better preventive and diagnostic tools, have provided our patients with an important improvement in their prognosis. The new developments in molecular genetics and biology are likely to change the way we approach a cardiac patient in the future. The diseases are now being deciphered at the most basic level, and the information obtained opens new possibilities not only for better therapeutic and diagnostic measures but also for prevention of the disease.</dc:description>
