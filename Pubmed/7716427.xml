The purpose of this study is to describe the short-term results after five months of running. DESIGN descriptive, cross-sectional study. SETTING female population of Talavera de la Reina and Cuenca cities, from November 1992 to the end of March 1993. PARTICIPANTS 10.050 healthy women between 45-64 years old, who were invited, by personal letter, to attend a mammography unit. RESULTS 6.503 women accepted the screening invitation (participation rate of 65%) without differences between both districts. The personal letter was the main information source to women, and the presence of beliefs, attitudes and favorable experiences were the main reasons to accept the screening. The rescreening was needed by 4% of women, and finally, 67 women (1.1%) were classified "positive". The programme cost for every women into the screening was 4.067 ptas. CONCLUSION According to these results, is it feasible as economically as from the point of view of the organization, to extend the programme in Castilla-La Mancha.</dc:description>
