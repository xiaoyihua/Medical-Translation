<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To evaluate post-treatment pulmonary function in patients with malignant extrapulmonary neoplasia and its relationship with age, type of neoplasty and treatment received. METHODS Cohort study of 95 pediatric patients after chemotherapy with or without surgery or extrapulmonary thoracic radiotherapy. The patients were in remission without treatment and able to undergo pulmonary function testing. Personal history and exposure to risk factors or toxic habits were evaluated. Clinical examination, chest radiographs, pulmonary gammography, basal and stress pulmometry, forced spirometry, whole body phletismography and carbonmonoxide transfer test were performed. RESULTS Mean age at diagnosis was 5 +/- 3.3 years. Treatment duration was 2.4 +/- 1.3 years and time without treatment 4.3 +/- 3. 3 years. Thirty-six patients were reviewed two and a half years after the first control. Thirty-nine patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 57 had solid tumors. Sixty percent showed functional restriction due to chest deformity after undergoing chest surgery. The association between functional restriction and radiotherapy (6 patients) did not produce poorer functional results. Forty-three percent showed initial change in TLCO. Nineteen percent showed basal hemoglobin saturation under 93% which in 16% fell after physical exercise. These alterations improved with time. However, restrictive change initially present in 11.5% persisted at the second evaluation. Thoracic surgery was the main cause of thoracic deformity and therefore of restrictive change. The children under 8 years old and those who received longer treatments tended to show the worst TLCO values. The patients with neuroblastoma showed greater restrictive change while the change in TLCO was more frequent in patients with Burkitt s lymphoma and in those treated with cyclophosphamide. CONCLUSIONS Neither personal or family history of respiratory disease nor the presence of symptoms such as cough served to identify risk of functional change. Restrictive change in pulmonary function was greater in patients who had undergone thoracic surgery. Functional values were worse in patients with neuroblastoma. Pulmonary function should be followed up in pediatric survivors of malignant neoplasia in order to prevent restrictive alterations.</dc:description>
