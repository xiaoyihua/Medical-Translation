<dc:description xml:lang="en">Histopathology plays an important role in the diagnosis of diffuse interstitial lung disease. New endoscopic techniques allow performance of sampling procedures that have the same diagnostic accuracy and fewer complications that open lung biopsy (OLB). We evaluated our experience with video thoracoscopic lung biopsy (VTLB) in comparison with OLB in terms of diagnostic accuracy, duration of pleural drainage and hospital stay, number and size of samples and complications. Thirty patients who underwent VTLB from March 1987 to January 1995, and 28 patients who underwent OLB from May 1987 to January 1995 were studied retrospectively. Diagnosis was achieved in the VLTB group in 96.66% of cases and in the OLB group in 92.85%. The number of specimens obtained was 1.5 (SD 0.5) in the VTLB group (p = 0.47). Overall specimen size expressed in cm3 was 13.3 (SD-15.4) in the VTLB group and 18.5 (SD 21) in the OLB group (p = 0.284). Length of pleural drainage in hours was 52 (SD 39.9) in the VTLB group and 89.1 (SD 47) in the OLB group (p = 0.002). Length of hospital stay in days was 3.5 (SD 2) in the VTLB group and 8.7 (3.5) in the OLB group (p = 0.001). Complications were fewer and less severe after VLTB. VLTB is as useful as OLD for obtaining lung biopsies in diffuse interstitial lung disease. VLTB also causes fewer complications and is less expensive because drainage times and hospital stays are shorter.</dc:description>
