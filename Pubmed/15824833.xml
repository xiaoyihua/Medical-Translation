<dc:description xml:lang="en">Loxoscelism, is caused by the bite of Loxosceles laeta spiders. It has two clinical forms: cutaneous loxoscelism (CL) and viscerocutaneous loxoscelism (VCL). VCL is characterized by hematuria, hemoglobinuria, jaundice, fever and sensorial involvement. In severe cases there is massive hemolysis and renal failure, with high lethality. We report a 71 year-old man, brought to the hospital five days after suffering a spider bite. The patient was admitted with a severe kidney failure, hemolysis, metabolic acidosis and clotting disorder. The patient was managed with adrenal steroids and dialisys but died five weeks after hospital admission. This particular patient consulted late and had multiple factors of poor prognosis.</dc:description>
