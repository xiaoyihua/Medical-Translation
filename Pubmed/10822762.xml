<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE The incidence of major thromboembolic complications in patients on oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) and the correlation of this with the intensity of the OAT and the INR level at the time of the episode have been assessed in our study. PATIENTS AND METHODS We have carried out a retrospective study including 1350 patients with an overall follow-up period of 6432 patient-years. The mean INR level throughout OAT and at the time of the mayor thromboembolic event were considered. The statistical analysis was performed by means of a survival analysis test. RESULTS The incidence of major thromboembolic complications found in our study was 1.18/100 patient-years. Those patients with a mean INR below the therapeutic range showed significantly a higher risk (3.31 times higher) of suffering from some sort of major thromboembolic complication. Mean INR level at the time of the event was 1.9 and 47% of those patients had an INR level &lt; 2 at the time of the thromboembolic complication. CONCLUSIONS The probability of suffering a major thromboembolic complication for those subjects on OAT increases as the INR falls below the therapeutic range; therefore we must pay special attention to this factor in order to avoid any further recurrences.</dc:description>
