<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the nutritional status of orthopaedic patients. DESIGN Prospective observation study. SETTING Tertiary hospital, Clinical Nutrition Unit. PATIENTS 107 patients (56.1% women, 43.9% men, 62.1 +/- 20.4 years) are studied at admission to the orthopaedic unit and it is observed the evolution of orthopaedic surgery patients with hip or knee prosthesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Medical history, anthropometric data and three nutritional screening tools were considered: Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) y Valoración Global Subjetiva (VGS). It was assessed the prevalence of malnutrition in patients on admission to hospital, using different methods and determining if a correlation exists between malnutrition and other factors, such as the development of pressure sores of the dependence in activities of daily living. RESULTS The risk of malnutrition is 22 and 24/100 patients admitted at hospital, if MNA and SGA are used, respectively (SGA caregorized 4% of the group as "malnourished"). 80% patients are considered to be at high risk of malnutrition using MUST. 1.7% patients presented a Body Mass Index (BMI) lower than 18.5. There is a strong agreement between malnutrition and neropsychological status (p = 0.001), and the dependence in activities of daily living (p = 0.002), and between medium and high risk of malnutrition and the development of pressure sores (p = 0.003). If MNA and SGA (p = 0.000) are used, post-surgical patients presents a deteriorating nutritional status. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of malnutrition in patients on admission to hospital is elevated. Orthopaedic surgery patients with hip and knee prosthesis presented a deteriorating nutritional status, and a higher incidence of pressure sores in a month.</dc:description>
