<dc:description xml:lang="en">The records of 27 patients operated for parotid tumors were reviewed retrospectively. Pleomorphic adenoma was the most frequent tumor (37.1%) and required subtotal parotidectomy in all cases. Twenty percent presented permanent facial paralysis of the marginal mandibular branch. No recurrence has been observed in five years of follow-up. Warthin's tumor, found in 11.1% of patients, was removed by either superficial or subtotal parotidectomy. Parotidean cysts were observed in 7.4% and were excised by superficial parotidectomy. The malignant tumors included squamous cell carcinoma (22.2%), adenoid cystic carcinoma (14.8%), melanoma (3.7%), and renal-cell metastasis (3.7%). All were treated by total parotidectomy with conservation of the facial nerve in 67%. Twenty-five percent had postoperative facial paralysis and 33% developed Frey's syndrome. Thirty-three percent died in the next 5 years from locoregional metastases.</dc:description>
