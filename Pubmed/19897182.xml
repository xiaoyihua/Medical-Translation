<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Laparoscopic approach is widely used in our country. This technique has dramatically improved the outcome after surgery, reducing pain, morbidity, hospital stay, and promoting early patient mobilization. OBJECTIVE This study presents 10 years experience and the first 100 adrenalectomies using laparoscopy performed between 1996 and 2007 in Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain. METHODS A descriptive and prospective study was designed, 100 consecutive cases were included. Sixty-seven variables were analysed; these variables were influenced by factors depending on patient susceptibility, surgical technique, surgeon, as well as in-surgery and post-surgery complications. RESULTS None of the patients in our series died. In the follow-up, only minor complications were reported: nosocomial pneumonia (1 patient), small eventration (2 patients), haematomas (2 patients), and infection at surgery site (2 patients). None of the complications required surgery. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that adrenalectomy by the laparoscopic approach could be the gold standard technique in a variety of patients with adrenal tumours. However, these should be performed within a specialised endocrinology surgery unit.</dc:description>
