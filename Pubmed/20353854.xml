<dc:description xml:lang="en">Pneumonia and seasonal influenza have major repercussions on mortality, morbidity and costs worldwide. At the end of March 2009, an outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) was reported in Mexico that rapidly spread throughout the world, including the United States, reaching pandemic proportions. The activity of influenza A (H1N1) has reached levels higher than those reported in previous years, mainly affecting the pediatric population aged less than 18 years old. In addition, a group of comorbid conditions were more frequently associated in patients with severe influenza A (H1N1), including chronic pulmonary disease, immunosuppression, heart disease, obesity and pregnancy. The current pandemic has had a substantial impact on public health in the United States and in many other countries worldwide. Therefore, the present review aims to examine the North American experience of the influenza A (H1N1) epidemic, focussing chronologically on the epidemiology of the virus, high risk groups, diagnosis, vaccination and management.</dc:description>
