<dc:description xml:lang="en">The instant corn flour prepared by the hydrothermal process using corn grits soaked in water at room temperature (28-30 degrees C) for 5 hours and steaming for 1 minute at 118 degrees C presented characteristics similar to that of flours prepared with grits soaked in water at temperature higher than room temperature and different steaming time (5 and 15 minutes). The addition of instant corn flour up of a 25% mixture with wheat flour reduced the peak of maximum viscosity during the heating cycle; however, the final viscosity during the cooling cycle was increased. The water absorption was increased with the increase of substitution in the level of wheat flour. Extensibility, maximum resistance and values of area were reduced with an increase in the level of instant corn flour in the mixture. However, extension resistance and proportional number were increased. Bread prepared from a mixture of instant corn flour and wheat flour showed higher weight with low loaf volume, color and texture of the crumb related to bread wheat.</dc:description>
