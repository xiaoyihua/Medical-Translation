<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The clinical presentation and progression of childhood migraine has still not been clearly defined. However, major advances in prognosis and treatment would follow this. OBJECTIVE To trace the clinical features and course of childhood migraine. PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective study, lasting 10 years, in a population of 284 children with migraine, seen at two hospitals. The data obtained were analysed using techniques of statistical significance and logistic regression. RESULTS In 24.3% headaches started before the age of 6 years, and in 57% at between 6 and 10 years of age. In 77.5% of the patients there was a family history of migraine, this figure rose to 82.6% in the children whose headaches started before the age of 6 years. Characteristics such as duration, site and accompanying factors differed from those seen in adults. There was spontaneous improvement in 88.3%, who did not require prophylactic medication. CONCLUSIONS Childhood migraine has some characteristics which distinguish it from adult migraine. This should be noted in classification. Most children with migraine have mild headaches which do not require prophylaxis. A genetic factor appears to play an important rol in phenotype expression of the disorder.</dc:description>
