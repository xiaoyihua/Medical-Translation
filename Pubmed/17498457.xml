<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic surgery offers an alternative diagnostic technique in multiple diseases requiring biopsy of non-digestive intra-abdominal masses in which image-guided biopsy cannot be performed. Laparoscopic biopsy aims to reduce the surgical aggression and complications associated with laparotomy and favors the early treatment of malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHOD We performed a retrospective descriptive study of our results in a series of patients in our hospital with intra-abdominal masses of unknown etiology who underwent laparoscopic surgery between January 2001 and April 2006. None of the patients were candidates for image-guided percutaneous biopsy. RESULTS We carried out 23 biopsies: 8 retroperitoneal (34.7%), 5 mesenteric (21.7%), 5 hepatic, 4 pelvic, and 1 in the iliac chain, as well as 5 complementary biopsies. In all patients, sufficient material for histologic diagnosis was obtained. The mean operating time was 71 minutes. Length of hospital stay was less than 24 hours in 61% of the patients. The median length of hospital stay was 1.5 days. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic approach allows complete visualization and examination of the entire peritoneal cavity. Laparoscopic biopsy is a safe and effective procedure with excellent patient recovery and allows early definitive treatment.</dc:description>
