<dc:description xml:lang="en">Injection of sclerosing solutions into the rectal submucosa or into the perirectal space is one of the many therapies designed to correct rectal prolapse. Since 1994, four patients affected with this condition have been treated with fibrin adhesive percutaneous injection. Up to now, this product had not been used to this aim. Age range was from 1 month to 8 years. The medium duration of prolapse prior to therapy was 19 months and three of them had an associated pathology (myelomeningocele, cystic fibrosis and severe psychomotor retardation). There were no post-injection complications. In one patient with an irreducible prolapse an anus encirclement with a rectal tube was associated. Except for this patient, the whole process take less than 24 hours. With a medium follow up of 11 months this therapy has resulted effective in three of our four patients. It has failed in a girl with severe psychomotor retardation.</dc:description>
