<dc:description xml:lang="en">The biomedical model has successfully reduced mother and child mortality and diseases during the labor and puerperal period. In the perinatal period, the mother and her offspring can also have psychosocial problems, that have been insufficiently studied and that we propose considering. Based on neurobiological information, on bonding theory and on a focus change in the everyday work of human behavior experts in maternity hospitals, we propose that perinatal mental health should have an important place and can be harmoniously articulated with the biomedical model. This mental health work should aim at generating safe mother-child bonds. It should be maintained Thereafter through social networks to prevent child abuse, to promote healthy development and to prevent psychopathology. We review some of the programs carried out in the ten year period in which we have worked as a mental health team in the maternity ward of a public hospital in Santiago, Chile.</dc:description>
