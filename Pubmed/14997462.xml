<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE We review the main aspects of functional recovery after brain injury as well as neuroimaging characteristics that make it relevant and useful to assess these changes. We also review some issues regarding recovery of motor and sensory functions, language and visuo spatial processes, and we discuss the methods used in this field, the difficulties found, and future implications. DEVELOPMENT One of the main aspects in the study of the brain is the capacity to reorganize different functions in order to compensate for the deficits after a lesion in the central nervous system. The study of these adaptive processes is important in a clinical field as well as for basic research, as it is a clear example of brain plasticity. All the findings show how the study of the plastic phenomena or functional reorganization will allow us to better know how the brain works after a lesion. CONCLUSION The use and combination of the new functional neuroimaging techniques gives the opportunity to register the reorganization of the brain with a high temporal and spatial resolution. It will give also an objective measure to assess the effectiveness of the rehabilitation programs. It will allow to identify different variables related to rehabilitation outcome and will guide effectively the selection of different rehabilitation approaches.</dc:description>
