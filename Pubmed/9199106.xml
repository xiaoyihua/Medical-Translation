<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM OF THE STUDY To determinate the prevalence of anxiety associated with vertigo of vestibular origin. DESIGN A retrospective study. SETTING Patients from Salamanca's University Hospital (Neuro-Otology). PATIENTS 138 patients with asymptomatic vestibular dysfunction (group A: with filiated disease and group B: with unfiliated disease). INSTRUMENTATION Structured anamnese and STAI questionnary (State-Trait-Anxiety-Scale) were realized in the whole collective. RESULTS Anxiety (elevated score in STAI-scale) was detected in 48.6% patients and more differences between groups A and B were not significant. With logistic regression anxiety is related with previous symptomatological experiences and subjective global incapacity. Anxiety is clearly connected with the symptoms in the intercritic periods.
