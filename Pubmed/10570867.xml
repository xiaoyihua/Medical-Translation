<dc:description xml:lang="en">Single system ectopic ureters are usually associated with multiple congenital abnormalities and the corresponding renal units is frequently abnormal. 19 cases of single system ectopic ureters were diagnosed and treated in our hospital during the last 20 years. The patients were less than 11 years old. The abnormality was bilateral in two cases and the 63% of all had associated malformations, being the anorectal abnormalities the most frequent. The incidence of reflux into the ectopic ureter was 57%, and the association to unilateral or contralateral renal agenesis, 26.3%. Thirteen ectopic ureters were reimplanted successfully into the bladder, and the cases of nonfunctioning kidneys were removed (nephroureterectomy). The follow-up period was 10 months to 14 years, developing the 68% of the cases without any complication and a good renal function. Two patients were transplanted due to a kidney failure. Diagnosis is often extremely difficult and requires a high degree of suspicion. This diagnosis may be incidental, and it may be made during investigation of patients with other malformations. An early diagnosis and treatment must be made in order to avoid a disturbance of renal function. We wish to point up the high incidence of reflux into the ectopic ureter and the high association to renal agenesis in the single system ectopic ureters in comparison with ectopic ureter of duplex system.</dc:description>
