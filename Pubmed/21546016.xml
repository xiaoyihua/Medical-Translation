<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUNDS The epidemiological studies of sarcoidosis in Spain and other countries are from more than one decade ago. OBJECTIVES To know the current incidence in the health care area of Leon, the reasons for consultation, the thoracic radiologyl involvement, delay and diagnostic methods. PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed the cases of sarcoidosis seen in our hospital between the years 2001-2008. The study is retrospective. RESULTS 118 patients fulfilled the criteria for sarcoidosis with an incidence of 4.51/100,000 inhab./year. Of these, 53 (44.9%) were male with a mean age of 36.4 ± 12.2 and 65 (55.1%) women, with a mean age of 42.6 ± 17.2 years (P = 0.029). The most frequent presentation form was Löfgren Syndrome with 45.8%, followed by respiratory symptoms 20.3%, radiological findings 12.7%, general syndrome 10.2% and miscellaneous 11%. Thoracic radiological affectations at the time of diagnosis were: stage I: 59.3%, stage II: 19.8%, stage III: 10%, fibrosis 3.4% and stage 0: 8.5%. Transbronchial biopsy was the most frequent diagnosis. Time to diagnosis was very variable with a median of 24.5 days, when it debuted as erythema nodosum, 80 in the less frequent forms. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of sarcoidosis was superior to that previously demonstrated. It affected young adults, but with an increase in the number of cases in those over 50 years with clear female predominance. Löfgren syndrome was the most frequent presentation form, with a higher incidence in spring. Diagnostic delay varied according to the different presentation forms. Transbronchial biopsy was the main diagnostic tool.</dc:description>
