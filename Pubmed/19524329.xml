METHODS A 12 month intervention studies used 700 EA randomized in 2 groups: intervention and control. Each group was submitted to pre-post intervention measurements that included weight, height, blood pressure (BP), cholesterol, lipids, glycaemia, cardiovascular (infarct, stroke) and bone fractures events, hospitalization, and a QOL survey. Intervention consisted of periodic physical activity to fortify muscular groups, as well as recreational activities, nutritional and food manipulation training visits. A medical student was assigned to each participant from the intervention group to assure periodical contact and to share activities. The control group continued with their normal activities during observational period. RESULTS The intervention group showed a significant reduction in the BP, lipids and cholesterol values compared to control group. Reduction on cardiovascular events (-31%), hip fractures (-18.2%) and number of hospital admittance (-21.1%) were obtained for group A in relation to B. The QOL survey showed 28.7% improvement for group A compared with 33.4% improvement compared with control group.
