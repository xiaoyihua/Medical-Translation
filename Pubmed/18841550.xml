<dc:description xml:lang="en">SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Several different indigenous groups (Yamana, Selk'nam, Alacaluf, Haush) used to inhabit the Patagonian region of Tierra de Fuego, but are now extinct. AIM To analyse the healing practices that these prehistoric aborigines used to treat headaches and to compare them with those observed in other anthropological studies. DEVELOPMENT The article reviews the most important manuscripts from the end of the 19th century written by anthropologists and missionaries who were in contact with these peoples (Bridges, Hyades, Gusinde). The Yamana, or 'canoero' Indians, lived in the coastal areas and ate mostly seals and shellfish. The Selk'nam were nomadic hunter-gatherers who lived in the northern part of the Isla Grande. The Yekamush were the Yamana healers. The chief palliative treatments for pain were fasting, drinking cold water and the application of localised heat and massages. Headaches were one of the most prevalent conditions among the Yamana. Treatment for headaches consisted in hitting the patient's head with prickly chaura (Pernettya mucronata) leaves, which produces a small amount of bleeding, or the use of fresh nettle leaves, which were held in place with a headband. The Selk'nam used the term kwaketan to refer to the feeling of sadness with pain, while the term kwake meant 'illness'. Other common ways of treating headaches included ritual ceremonies with chanting, the detection of painful points, and the absorption and expulsion of the kwake. CONCLUSIONS Headaches were one of the most frequent neurological pathologies among these prehistoric Fuegian aborigines, in line with the observations made in other transcultural studies conducted on present-day native cultures.</dc:description>
