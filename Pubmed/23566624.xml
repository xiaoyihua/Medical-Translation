<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The management of hyperglycemia in conventional wards is suboptimal. The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of a proactive intervention supported by point-of-care system with remote viewing of capillary blood glucose (CBG) on glycemic control as compared to usual care in non-critical surgical patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD Two sequential periods of 2 months were defined. In the first phase (control, CPh), in which the surgical team was in charge of glycemic control, capillary glucose levels were recorded by StatStrip(®) system, and endocrinological support was provided upon surgeons request. In a second phase (intervention, IPh), the endocrinologist proceeded based on remotely-viewed CBG values. We compared the use of basal-bolus therapy and the degree of glycemic control between the 2 study periods. RESULTS The IPh was associated with greater use of basal-bolus regimens (21.4 vs. 58.3%; P=.003). The average CBG during the CPh was 161 ± 64 vs. 142 ± 48 mg/dL during the IPh (P&lt;.001). The IPh was associated with an increased frequency of CBG determinations between 70-140 mg/dL (CPh: 41.8 vs. IPh: 52.5%; P&lt;.001), lower frequency of ≥ 250 mg/dL CBG determinations (CPh: 9 vs. IPh: 3.5%; P&lt;.001), with no increase in the frequency of hypoglycemia (CPh: 3 vs. IPh: 3.7%; P=.39). CONCLUSIONS A proactive endocrine intervention facilitated by a point-of-care system with remote viewing of CBG is associated with improved glycemic control in non-critical patients, without any further increase in the number of hypoglycaemic recordings.</dc:description>
