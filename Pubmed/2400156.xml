<dc:description xml:lang="en">345 infants (179 boys and 166 girls) have been studied during the first year of life. The social, economic and education characteristics correspond with III category of Graffar. Breast-feeding in 80 per 100% of the cases was the initial feeding. Beikost was introduced in the 5th month +/- 8 days. The increasing weight is higher in the children fed with adapted formula that those who had made it through breast-feeding, with statistical differences (p less than 0.01) in boys and girls between the third and fifth month. Girls also showed gaining in weight with significant differences between the fifth and seventh month (p less than 0.05). According to the comparative study carried out in the twelfth month those boys fed with adapted formula show higher values of the sum of the skinfold thickness and fat percentage (p less than 0.05), than those who were breast-fed for a period of live months or more; the rest of analyzed parameters (weight, length, body mass, Roher or K index) do not show any significant differences in the study carried out in both groups of infants in the first year of life.</dc:description>
