<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Langerhans cell histiocytosis is characterized by a clonal proliferation of activated Langerhans cells that infiltrate various organs of the body. Occurs at any age, from newborn until adulthood, with an incidence peak at 1-4 years. OBJECTIVE To describe the morphologyc characteristics of skin lesions and clinical course of 15 patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. METHODS A retrospective review of the medical records of patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis from Ramos Mejia Hospital and Aleman Hospital, between 1999-2007. RESULTS Review of medical records from 15 patients, 6 females and 9 males. Skin lesions were congenital in 8 cases and appeared between 2-12 months of age in 7 cases. The patients with congenital presentation only had a cutaneous manifestation; one patient who developed a systemic compromise (lung, liver and spleen) is currently under treatment. Three patients with presentation after birth only had cutaneous lesions, the others had a systemic disease. One of this patients died during treatment. Histopathology showed a histiocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis with epidermotrophism; inmunomarking with S100 and CD1a was positive. CONCLUSION Both clinical manifestation (congenital and after birth) represent different ends of a spectrum of the same condition, with the potencial to develop into disseminated Langerhans cell histiocytosis.</dc:description>
