<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The problem of mercury effects on humans and the environment is global, and it has different impacts on health. It is necessary, therefore, to address this issue from a broad overview to identify populations at risk of exposure, health effects, the production processes involved and the actions aimed at reducing exposure and mitigating the impact. OBJECTIVE To design a conceptual and operational framework to develop strategies for prevention, control and mitigation of mercury effects on health and on the environment in Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a two-phase study: a literature review following the Cochrane methodology and forums with national and international experts using a comprehensive planning methodology to identify priority actions and establish a national research agenda. RESULTS The results of the review were structured into four components: mercury effects on health, legal framework in Colombia, emission inventory for the country and health plans and programs. We made recommendations for the design of an intervention plan considering five lines of action: technologies for exposure management, institutional strengthening for exposure prevention and control, strategies for strengthening diagnosis and care, health education on mercury risks, and knowledge generation. CONCLUSION We detected information gaps, technical weaknesses, and the need of administrative and other resources in this field in Colombia. We proposed priority actions to reduce the economic, social and health impact from exposure to mercury.</dc:description>
