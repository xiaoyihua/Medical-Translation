<dc:description xml:lang="es">Purpose: To determine the prevalence of physical activity in physiotherapy students of aSpanish university.Methodology: The short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire wasadministered to a sample of 145 studies (101 women and 44 men, mean age 20.84 SD 3.92years). The questionnaire measured intensity, duration and frequency of physical activityperformed the week before the test was applied. After calculating physical activity,distribution of frequency was made in regards to activity levels and then the Pearsoncorrelation coefficients were calculated to determine the relationship between the studyvariables. In addition, the T test was applied to evaluate the gender-based differences inphysical activity.Results: In this work, 116 students (80%) were classified as being regularly active. By levelof activity, the following percentages were obtained: high 31.3%, mean 47.6% and low 19.7%.Statistically significant correlations were found between the PAI and vigorous intensity(r ¼ 0.52; po0.001), moderate intensity (r ¼ 0.676; po0.001) and to walk (r ¼ 0.886;po0.001). Although the moderate physical activity is heterogeneous in man, there weresignificant differences in sedentarism (t143 ¼ 2.706; p ¼ 0,04) between genders.Conclusions: A high percentage of Physiotherapy students practice physical activityregularly. This activity is sufficient to reach the recommended levels for healthmaintenance. Differences in moderate physical activity practice between women andmen were found(AU)</dc:description>
