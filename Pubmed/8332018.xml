<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are a common complication in patients with advanced neoplasms. Even though no large series confirming this exist, tetracycline pleurodesis has become the therapy of choice. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate its efficacy, adverse effects and possible factors predicting the success of the method. METHODS Between 1985 through 1991, 91 patients with cytologically or histologically confirmed MPE were treated with 1,000-1,500 mg tetracycline pleurodesis. There were 49 females and 42 males, with a mean age of 59 years. The most common malignancies were lung, breast and unknown primary carcinomas. 85% patients complained of dyspnea and the volume of the effusion was moderate in half the cases. 12 variables were analyzed in relation with the probability of response through chi 2 test; survival and recurrence times were calculated with Kaplan and Meier's method. RESULTS 73 patients were evaluable, with a 67% response rate (22 complete, 27 partial). Time to relapse was significantly higher for partial responses (mean 112 days) than for failures (mean 33 days). 37 patients presented mild complications (pain and fever). Karnofsky performance status (70% or greater), size of the effusion (small or moderate), chest radiograph (only effusion) and pleural LDH (600 U/l or less) attained favourable prognostic significance. Median survival was reached at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Tetracycline pleurodesis is an effective and well-tolerated paliative treatment for MPE. Along with other known parameters (pleural pH and glucose levels), Karnofsky performance status, size of the effusion, chest radiograph and pleural LDH allow to predict its results and optimize its indications.</dc:description>
