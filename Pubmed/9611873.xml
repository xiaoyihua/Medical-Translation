<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Group EF-4 bacteria make up part of the normal flora of the oral cavity of dogs and cats. Few reports have been published on the incidence of human infections by this group of bacteria and these are associated with animal bite or scratch. Two cases of infections by CDC group EF-4 by dog bite were diagnosed in 1996 by the Bacteriology Laboratory of the authors' hospital. These cases are herein described and the biochemical analysis and profile of sensitivity of this little known group of bacteria evaluated. METHODS Two clinical cases of infection by CDC group EF-4a by dog bite are described. Identification of the bacteria was performed by conventional biochemical tests and quantitative antibiotic sensitivity to 12 antibiotics was carried out by the seried broth macrodilution method. RESULTS The two strains isolated corresponded to biovar "a" of group EF-4 being sensitive to: ampicillin, ceftriaxone, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, rifamipicin, TMS and ciprofloxacin, intermediate sensitivity to erythromycin and were resistant to cefalotine, oxacillin and vancomycin. With respect to penicillin, one of the strains was sensitive and the other presented intermediate sensitivity. Neither of the strains produced beta lactamase. CONCLUSIONS Although Pasteurella sp. is usually considered in dog bite wounds, the possible presence of group EF-4 should be taken into account since the sensitivity of both microorganisms against penicillin and cefalotin, which are effective against Pasteurella but less active against group EF-4 bacteria differ.</dc:description>
