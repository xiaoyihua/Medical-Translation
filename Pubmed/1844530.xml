<dc:description xml:lang="en">Child abuse or battered child syndrome is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood in the United States and is not uncommon in our country. Mild to severe neurologic damage is commonly seen. Skeletal injuries, although not usually the cause of permanent damage, may constitute important medical and legal evidence of child abuse. Understanding of the mechanisms of injury in accidental and non accidental trauma helps the pediatrician and the radiologist in the diagnosis of abuse. While correct diagnosis can be suspected clinically, specific types of fractures should alert the radiologist to the likelihood of abuse or the need of additional films or clinical reevaluation of the patient. People in general, should be aware of child abuse and of the convenience of appropriate preventive measures. In addition to pediatricians and radiologists, other experts should also be directly involved in this problem, including pathologists, psychiatrists, lawyers, social workers and so on.</dc:description>
