<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Penile and scrotal lymphedema produces a monstrous deformity with psychological impact and occasionally extreme mental anguish. The penis is buried in the scrotal tissue, deformed, thickened, edematous, and curved. The scrotum changes to a great, very thick, hard skin mass, sometimes cracked, exudative, and fetid. Erection and sexual intercourse are very difficult or impossible, and the scrotal enlargement interferes with walking. To report a new case of male external genitalia lymphedema. METHODS/RESULTS We present a technical variation of the surgical treatment of penile-scrotal primary lymphedema in a 32-year-old patient suffering this disease for several years, which had underwent several medical and surgical treatments, such as lymphangioplasty and penile root fasciotomy. Observation consisted in the performance of two incisions in w-plasty, one at the root of the penis, the other one in the preserved preputial mucosa, and excision of all the lymphedematous tissue with reconstruction using the preputial mucosa and a small area of non infiltrated skin at the root of the penis. In the scrotum, two butterfly-wing shape skin flaps were performed; the testicles and the spermatic cord were isolated to ease the operation, minimize the surgical time and avoid complications; the lymphedematous tissue was resected with a great fragment of scrotum; finally reconstruction was performed from the adjacent healthy skin. CONCLUSIONS With this technique it was not necessary to perform a free or vascularized skin graft. The patient recovered his penile functional capacity improved aesthetically and his anguish disappear.</dc:description>
