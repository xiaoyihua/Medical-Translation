<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Recently, many studies have focused on the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) in order to clarify if DUP could be one of the factors that would influence prognosis of psychotic disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS We present a one year follow - up study with 90 medication native, first episode psychotic patients. The likely prognosis factors that could influence in the outcome of the disease were measured. Therefore, we used a protocol including the following scales: PANSS, Psychosocial Stress Global Assessment scale (DSM IIIR), Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF-EEAG), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Montgomery-Asberg scale for the depression, Young mania rating scale, abnormal involuntary movements scale, UKU scale for extrapyramidal symptoms and Premorbid Adjustment scale (Cannon-Spoor). Assessments were made every three months for 1 year. A statistical analysis of data was performed. RESULTS As a result, it was concluded that there was no relationship between a long duration untreated psychosis and a worse outcome of the illness in our sample. The only related factors with the prognosis were premorbid adjustment and the type of disease onset. Hence, the patients with a better premorbid adjustment and an acute onset of psychosis had a better outcome. CONCLUSION Our study represents more evidence in favor of the independence of DUP and disease outcome.</dc:description>
