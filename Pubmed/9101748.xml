<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND An approach of daily or 5 days per week treatment as maintenance therapy is mandatory among HIV patients with CMV retinitis. We evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of thrice weekly maintenance therapy for CMV retinitis in AIDS patients. METHODS Sixty nine consecutive patients with CMV disease were eligible for a prospective open clinical trial. Thirty three completed the induction treatment of CMV retinitis, agreed on maintenance thrice weekly and were included. Twenty nine received Ganciclovir (10 mg/kg/day) and 4 foscarnet (100 mg/kg/day) thrice weekly. RESULTS The mean age was 34 years. Twenty nine of the 33 (87%) were males and 13 (39%) drug addicts. Mean CD4+ lymphocyte count at inclusion was 44 cells per relapsed and 22 (66%) died. The median time to relapse, survival free of CMV retinitis and the median survival was 18, 14 and 34 weeks respectively. CONCLUSION Since the outcome of our patients with thrice weekly maintenance therapy was similar to historical controls our study at least provides the rational for this hypothesis to be tested in a future randomised trial.</dc:description>
