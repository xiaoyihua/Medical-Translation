<dc:description xml:lang="en">The frequency distribution of HLA antigen in 100 infants with bronchiolitis is compared to a control population of 100 healthy blood donors. No differences were found in the frequency distribution of both A and B antigens, but B 7 antigen was more frequently present in patients with bronchiolitis and increased serum IgE (47% VS 17% in the control group with normal serum IgE). Serum IgE was increased in 27% of the patients with bronchiolitis. The incidence of recurrent respiratory episodes was 62% in infants carrying the B 7 antigen whereas it was only of 14,5% in the whole series (pc less than 0,05). All infants with increased serum levels of IgE and recurrent respiratory episodes had the B 7 antigen. We believe that the presence of IgE and recurrent respiratory episodes had the B 7 antigen. We believe that the presence of B 7 antigen influence the clinical course of bronchiolitis in the sense that a high percent will present with recurrent respiratory episodes and increased levels of serum IgE.</dc:description>
