<dc:description xml:lang="en">The structural abnormalities of the genitourinary tract and cervical/vaginal infections are common in patients with diabetes mellitus. The objective was to determine the prevalence of gynecological abnormalities in diabetic women and to investigate its association with different variables. Diabetic women, aged 20 years and older who were attending the diabetic outpatient clinic, were randomly selected. All patients underwent a clinical and gynecological examination and a urianalysis, and papanicolaou. Smear were obtained. A total of 98 women, 84.7% type 2 diabetics, with a mean age of 57 +/- 13 years were included. Uretherocele, cystocele and/or rectocele were present in 19% and cervicitis in 22% of the patients. Urinary incontinence (OR 3.1, p = 0.03) and the history of multiparity (OR 4.2, p = 0.03) were statistically associated with these structural abnormalities. The symptom of vaginal discharge (OR 3.8, p = 0.01) was the only one variable that correlated with cervicitis. By comparing patients with and without cervicitis or gynecologic abnormalities, no significant differences were observed related to the type, duration or treatment of diabetes, blood glucose control or the evidence of leukocyturia in the urine sample. There is an elevated prevalence (31%) of gynecological abnormalities (cervicitis and/or structural abnormalities) in diabetic women, and are mostly asymptomatic.</dc:description>
