<dc:description xml:lang="en">Beliefs and attitudes about treatment in patients with depression are significant factors related to treatment adherence. Despite their importance, few studies have evaluated the determining factors of these beliefs, and the positive or negative attitudes towards treatment. This review looks at areas such as, adherence to antidepressants and psychotherapy, influence of beliefs and attitudes on adherence to treatment, beliefs and attitudes about depression and its treatment, their assessment, variables associated with these beliefs, and limitations of available studies. Acknowledging the importance of patient beliefs about depression and treatment, and their assessment are essential to optimize the chances of success of therapy by identifying and addressing misconceptions, prejudices and negative attitudes, as well as the consideration of these aspects in order to improve treatment choice.</dc:description>
