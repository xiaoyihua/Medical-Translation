<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE This study reviews the clinical characteristics of patients with diabetic foot ulcer treated in a Multidisciplinary Diabetic Foot Unit (MDFU) and analyzes the mortality and factors associated with its survival. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data from all patients who attended the MDFU for the first time for a diabetic foot ulcer during the 2008-2014 period were analized. The patients were followed until their death or until June 30, 2016, for up to 8 years. RESULTS A total of 345 patients were included, with a median age (P25-P75) of 71 (61.5-80) years, and 321 (93%) had type 2 diabetes. They were characterized as patients with inadequate glycemic control, 48% had HbA1c ≥ 8% and high prevalence of chronic complications: 60.2% retinopathy, 43.8% nephropathy and 47.2% ischemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease. A total of 126 (36.5%) patients died and 69 (54.8%) were due to cardiovascular disease. Survival measured by Kaplan-Meier declined over time to 69, 60 and 45% at 3, 5 and 7 years respectively. Cox's multivariate regression analysis showed the following variables associated with mortality, HR (95% CI): age 1.08 (1.05-1.11); previous amputation 2.24 (1.34-3.73); active smoking 2.10 (1.12-3.97); cerebrovascular disease 1.75 (1.05-2.92); renal dysfunction 1.65 (1.04-2.61) and ischemic heart disease 1.60 (1.01-2.51). CONCLUSIONS Patients with diabetic foot ulcer are characterized by high morbidity and mortality, with cardiovascular disease being the most frequent cause of death. It is necessary to pay more attention to this risk group, tailoring objectives and treatments to their situation and life expectancy.</dc:description>
