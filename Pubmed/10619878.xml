<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION A thyroglossal cyst (TGC) is an unusual neck lesion that is occassionally diagnosed in a general hospital that mostly attend adult patients. The aim of the current study was to analyze our experience in the management of these lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS The records of 43 patients operated on at the Social Security Hospital in Quito (Ecuador) from 1980 to 1998 for a thyroglossal duct cyst or fistula, were reviewed. RESULTS Distribution was similar in both sexes. Mean age was 23. Thirty-five patients presented with a cystic lesion located in the midline or slightly laterally in the neck, closely related to the hyoid bone; the other 8 patients had a cutaneous fistula at the same place. All of the patients but one, underwent a radical Sistrunk procedure; complications were minor. In 5 patients (12%), a papillary thyroid carcinoma within the TGC was reported at the histologic study. No recurrence developed after a mean 23-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS A cyst or a fistula located at the level of the hyoid bone suggest a thyroglossal duct lesion. A papillary carcinoma can rarely occur within the TGC. A Sistrunk procedure is usually curative.</dc:description>
