<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Nail involvement is common in psoriasis and has a considerable impact on patient quality of life. Its clinical presentation depends on which part of the nail is affected: the bed or the matrix. Fifty percent of patients report associated pain. In this study, we analyzed the safety and effectiveness of tazarotene 0.1% in a hydrophilic ointment in the treatment of nail psoriasis. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed an open observational study of 6 patients diagnosed with nail psoriasis. The patients applied a compounded preparation of tazarotene 0.1% ointment under occlusion every night for 6 months in their homes. They were not receiving any other topical or systemic treatments. Nail psoriasis severity (assessed using the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index [NAPSI]), subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, oil stains, and nail pitting were evaluated at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS A statistically significant improvement between baseline and 6 months was observed in all patients: the mean (SD) NAPSI went from 14.3 (6.3; 95% CI, 11.74-16.92) to 2.3 (1.21; 95% CI, 1.84-2.3) while the median went from 15 to 2.5 (P = .007). The percentage improvement at the end of treatment was 87.9%. No adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION Our study shows the therapeutic potential of tazarotene ointment in nail psoriasis.</dc:description>
