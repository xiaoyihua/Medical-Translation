<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is the most common indication for elective splenectomy. The laparoscopic approach has been used over the past ten years. AIM To report our experience with laparoscopic splenectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective review of 27 patients subjected to splenectomy due to hematological diseases. Among them, 17 patients (78% female, age range 17-70 years old) were subjected to a laparoscopic splenectomy. Eligibility criteria were the presence of benign disease, an informed consent by the patient, a spleen size of less than 20 cm by ultrasound and absence of previous surgery in the upper left quadrant. The rest of the patients were subjected to an open splenectomy. RESULTS Seventy one percent of patients subjected to laparoscopic splenectomy had an ITP. Mean operating time was 184 minutes. The mean spleen size was 11 cm and the mean weight was 186 g (70-450). No patient died or had complications. No patient required a conversion to an open surgery. Transfusions were not required. The median hospital stay was 3 days. CONCLUSIONS Elective laparoscopic splenectomy is a safe and low risk surgical procedure.</dc:description>
