<dc:description xml:lang="en">From October 1985 to May 1992, 400 patients had coronary angioplasty of 518 stenotic lesions with a 92% success rate. Mean stenosis was reduced from 88 to 15%. We had 25 major complications (6%): 8 emergency bypass surgery (2%), MI in 12 pts (3%) and 5 deaths (1%). Follow-up was possible in 329 of the 367 patients with a successful procedure (90%), with a mean follow-up of 44 months. We performed coronary angiogram in 113 patients with clinical data suggestive of restenosis, restenosis was found in 73, progression of the coronary atherosclerosis in 18 and 22 (19%) had no evidence of restenosis. A second coronary angioplasty was performed in 44 pts with a 93% success rate, 22 were sent to coronary bypass surgery and medical treatment was given to 7 patients. The 18 pts with progression of the disease were also sent to bypass surgery. During follow-up 25% of the patients required a second angioplasty or bypass surgery. A total of 115 (35%) pts showed evidence of restenosis: in 73 pts (22%) a coronary angiogram revealed restenosis, 12 had angina, 15 myocardial infarction and 15 died of cardiovascular disease. At the end of follow-up 259 pts (79%) were free of myocardial infarction, bypass surgery or cardiovascular death. Survival rate at 3.7 years was 94.5%. In conclusion, coronary angioplasty showed to be safe, effective and with a good long term outcome.</dc:description>
