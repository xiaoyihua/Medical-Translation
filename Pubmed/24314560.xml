<dc:description xml:lang="en">Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumours that affect women of reproductive age and they represent the main indication for surgery for benign uterine pathology. In 25% of cases, they become clinically apparent, causing heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain and/or infertility. Therefore, fibroids have a notable impact on the economic costs for the health system and also on the quality of life of the women they afflict. Although MRI is the most precise technique to diagnose fibroids, ultrasound remains the most cost-effective method. Surgery has been the treatment of choice for years, and several minimally invasive procedures have recently been developed. There are a wide variety of conservative medical treatment options, which are continually expanding. Research on the biology of these tumours can lead to new therapeutic options for the management of fibroids as we better understand the role that growth factors and genetic mutations play in them.</dc:description>
