<dc:description xml:lang="en">The study of acute herpetic gingivostomatitis (AHGS) has been a very interesting theme for those dealing with periodontal practice. The majority of the authors states the application of symptomatic treatment for such disease and there is a nearly universal criterium that its lesions can be maintained up to 14 days. We decided to star a searching in the up-to-date literature and we found some very serious studies where was stated, among other statements, the application of a specific chemotherapy using an analogous pyrimidine: iodoxuridine. Since then, we started the study of AHGS in 20 children with clinical diagnosis of such disease. In 10 children a symptomatic treatment was applied and in the rest topical applications of collyrium of 0.1% iodoxuridine, three times a day. Both groups were appointed after three, seven and ten days of being under treatment in order to verify the evolution of symptoms (pain) and signs vesicles or ulcer). It was observed that either lesions or pain disappeared in a shortly time in those children treated with iodoxuridine, without side effects. It is concluded that the use of this drug was effective for our patients and, therefore, we suggest its study and application.</dc:description>
