<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective was to know the characteristics of presentation, its clinical aspects and the modification in the diagnostic tools in a selected population of Mexican women with spontaneous menopause. The age at menarche, age at menopause, marital status, age at marriage, number of pregnancies and occupation of 1,099 women with spontaneous menopause were studied. In 619 women which were not receiving nor had received hormone replacement therapy the clinical, laboratory such as glucose, lipids, hormones, bone remodeling biochemistry; and X ray studies such as densitometry and mammography were analyzed. The age average of menarche presentation was at 13 years, and that of spontaneous menopause at 48.1 years 78% were married, with an age at marriage of 23 years, 66% had home duties. The screening tests showed that 30% of patients required cardiovascular evaluation, 40% showed alterations on lipids levels and at least 40% had some alteration on bone remodeling biochemistry or in densitometry. The mammography was normal in 81%. This study showed that most of the data in these group of women were similar to those of other populations, and many of them need intensive surveillance and adequate therapeutic prescriptions to diminish risk factors.</dc:description>
