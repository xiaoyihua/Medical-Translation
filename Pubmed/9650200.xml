<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Diagnosis of mycobacterioses in HIV infected patients is sometimes difficult because of atypical findings. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of gallium scintigraphy in diagnosis of AIDS related mycobacterioses in patients with fever of unknown origin. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the scans of 220 HIV(+) patients with fever (176 males [80%] and 44 females) who were evaluated with conventional diagnostic procedures at least of a week before. RESULTS Gallium scintigraphy was positive in 114 patients (51%) and negative in 106 (49%). Mycobacteria were isolated in 83 patients (38%), 75 of these patients (90%) had a positive scintigraphy (sensitivity 90%; specificity 71%). Positive predictive value was 66% and negative predictive value was 92%. Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare (MAI) and M. tuberculosis were diagnosed in 22 (29%) and 53 (71%) HIV(+) patients, respectively. Seventy one (94%) of 75 patients with mycobacterioses had gallium uptake in at least two localizations. CONCLUSIONS 67Ga scintigraphy is very useful in HIV(+) patients with fever of unknown origin. A negative gallium scintigraphy makes unlikely the diagnosis of mycobacterioses.</dc:description>
