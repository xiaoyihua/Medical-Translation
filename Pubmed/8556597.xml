<dc:description xml:lang="en">In Spain in recent years two studies have been carried out into the prevalence of stroke. In the study made in Girona of the rural population over 64 years of age, the prevalence for stroke was 4,012 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The figure was higher for women- 5,072 -than for men 2,675 cases. Transient Ischaemic Attacks (TIA) had a prevalence rate of 679 cases per 100,000 population of those aged over sixty-nine, being higher for men (1,161 cases) than for women (371 cases). The results from Girona differ from the findings in other Spanish regions in that the former are lower but at the same time are similar to those obtained in other western countries. The greatest risk factors for those over 69 years old were arterial hypertension, earlier episodes of TIA, diabetes, auricular fibrillation, congestive cardiac insufficiency, chronic bronchitis, myocardial infarction peripheral vascular-diseases, arteriosclerosis, heart disease with embolization and alcohol abuse.</dc:description>
