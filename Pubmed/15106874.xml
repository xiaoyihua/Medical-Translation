<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE As part of the evaluation of the obligations which the health sector acquired within the national policy for eradication of child labor, it is necessary to analyze their pertinence in relation to the context, the goals of the system and, overall, the needs felt by children of both sexes, young workers and their families. METHODS For this evaluation the systemic approach is used where one side the commitments are compared with the social, political and economic context in which they were formulated and, on the other side, all those involved in the subject are called. From this a comparative strategy or triangulation is generated in order to obtain the coincident aspects as well as the conflicting ones, analyzing the different positions. RESULTS Difficulties become evident in the sector regarding decision taking, as well as the ignorance of children and youths as social subjects of rights. CONCLUSIONS In the health sector limitations are present for the understanding of the phenomenon of child labor, as well as of the role of the health sector in the solution of the problem ad the structural barriers created by the Law 100 of 1993.</dc:description>
