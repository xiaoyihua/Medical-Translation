<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objectives of the studies described herein were: 1) to obtain a sunflower flour and protein concentrate for human consumption, and 2) to explore possible ways for their utilization. The Peredovik variety was selected, since it is most abundant in Mexico. The procedure usually followed for the obtention of flours for animal feeds was used with some modifications. The hull was mechanically eliminated with a yield of 51%, with a satisfactory appearance of the almond. In order to facilitate the milling of the almonds, 80% of the oil was extracted by compression (18,000 kg/cm2 for 10 minutes) after steaming during 10 min. Chlorogenic acid ws eliminated with a 70% ethanol solution. The resulting flour could be added to wheat flour in as high a proportion as 65% in weight. Cookies were then prepared which contained 16 g/100 g with a protein of high quality, 80% to 90% in relation to casein, and with adequate sensorial properties.</dc:description>
