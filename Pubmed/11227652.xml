<dc:description xml:lang="en">Crohn's disease is not usually included among the causes of ascites. Although cases of Crohn's disease presenting as ascites have occasionally been described, the appearance of ascites during follow-up, with no relationship with other complications of the disease, such as thrombosis of the suprahepatic veins, has not been previously described. We present the case of a 36-year-old female patient with Crohn's disease who presented ascites during evolution. Evacuative paracenteses were required. No causes apart from Crohn's disease were found. Ascites followed a parallel course to acute episodes of this disease.</dc:description>
