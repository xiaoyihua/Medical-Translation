<dc:description xml:lang="en">Frequency of cytogenetic alterations (micronuclei and chromosome aberrations), DNA repair deficiencies and acetylcholinesterase activity was determined for field workers in Bogotá, Colombia. These workers were regularly exposed to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides while employed on farms for flower growing. Interviews were conducted with 31 workers associated with occupational risk of pesticides exposure and 30 without exposure. A standard cytogenetic assay was used to determine chromosome aberrations and micronuclei frequencies. In addition, a challenge assay assessed response to gamma-rays as an indication of DNA repair deficiencies--cells were exposed to gamma-rays in vitro and the frequencies of chromosome aberrations in post-irradiation metaphase cells were quantified. The data were evaluated for percentage of aberrant cells, cells with chromosome aberrations and frequencies of chromatid breaks per 100 metaphase cells in each worker. The exposed group had a significantly higher frequency of cells with chromosome aberrations and micronuclei as compared with the non-exposed group (p = 0.02). However, the challenge assay did not indicate a significant difference (p &gt; 0.1). These findings require confirmation by further analytical studies involving larger sample. Cytogenetic and toxicological studies, in conjunction with thorough clinical examination are recommended.</dc:description>
