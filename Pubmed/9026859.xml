<dc:description xml:lang="en">Trichinellosis is a zoonosis caused by parasites of the genus Trichinella. Transmission of trichinellosis to humans has been shown to occur mainly by the ingestion of meat from pigs, bears of foxes parasitized with muscle larvae of this parasite. However, in Europe, the major human outbreaks of the disease have occurred due to the ingestion of parasitized horse meat. Although the larvae were not isolated from the horse meat, the identification of larvae as T. nativa, T. britovi and T. spiralis was done in biopsy samples obtained from infected individuals. More recently T. spiralis muscle larvae have been isolated and identified, for the first time, in muscle tissue of horses slaughtered at an abattoir in the State of Mexico. Furthermore, in ELISA assays using total extracts or TSL-1 antigens, circulating antibodies against Trichinella have been detected in horses slaughtered at abattoirs from various countries in Europe and Mexico. On the other hand, the experimental infection of horses with parasites of the genes Trichinella has been achieved by several research groups and data obtained regarding the kinetics of antibody production in these animals are important in the development of sensitive and specific diagnostic assays for horse trichinellosis. This will allow to determine the frequency of this infection in horses which are used for animal and human feeding. These assays will also be very helpful for designing strategies to control transmission on the disease by horse meat.</dc:description>
