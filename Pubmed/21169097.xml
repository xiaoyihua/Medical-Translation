<dc:description xml:lang="en">Smoking is responsible for atherosclerosis-mediated cardiovascular pandemic. Change and accelerate reactions in structures and functions. Form factors and stimulates tumor atheroma. Induces thrombosis and occludes arteries. The sinister intrusion attacks the cardiovascular system. The damage occurs in their genetic foundations and bimolecular intimacy. The remedy is abstinence, solves everything and it is just behavior. Addiction feeds dissent that is based on fallacies and irrelevant controversies. Much is ignorance, misjudgments, bad experiences which originates controversies. Why are things this way? it is not understood as it should. Public opinion is manipulated information, reductionism and negative Manichaeism. The solutions are provided through interdisciplinary and holistic reasoning. They suggest sticking to education based on universal values from early ages. Also abstinence promotion and self-control culture, for the sake of oneself and towards neighborhood. The new paradigm should pursue a doctrine of conversion, which nobody is exempt from benefit. Interpreting the alternative posed by nature of stating Phyisiodulia or Physiopathology is equivalent to: respect, or illness and death.</dc:description>
