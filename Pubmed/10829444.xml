<dc:description xml:lang="en">BASIS The utility of the abdominal plain film in the emergency department to evaluate urolithiasis is questionable. Between another things, there are influence of the different formation of distinct examinators. METHODS A retrospective study in 65 patients referrals to urology in 1997 and 1998 by suspicion of renal colic was carried out. The radiography of abdomen took in the emergency room the day of the income is reviewed with a protocol, by a resident of Familiar and Community Medicine and by the urologist, separately and without information of the medical records. RESULTS We have excluded three patients. At last, we diagnose 49 patients as renal colic with certainty, 6 patients with doubtful diagnosis and 7 patients with distinct diagnosis. The urologist achieved the most adequate reading in 11 cases; in 7 was best the resident, to equal in 31, and in 13 the differences were not important. The resident obtained of radiography a sensitivity of the 67% and a specificity of the 42% and the urologist 71% and 57% respectively. CONCLUSIONS There are few differences of reading, at least when the resident dispose a protocol of interpretation. Despite to the almost null diagnostic utility of the radiography, supply additional ation, and permit to value the evolution with a few aggressive technique.</dc:description>
