<dc:description xml:lang="en">Introduction and objective: The early detection of upper limb complications is important in women operated on for breast cancer. The 'FACT-B+4-UL' questionnaire, a specific variant of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) is available among others to measure the upper limb function. Patients and methods: The Spanish version of the upper limb subscale of the FACT-B+4 was validated in a prospective cohort of 201 women operated on for breast cancer (factor analysis, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity and sensitivity to change were determined). Its predictive capacity of subsequent lymphoedema and other complications in the upper limb was explored using logistic regression. Results: This subscale is unifactorial and has a great internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.87), its test-retest reliability and construct validity are strong (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.986; Pearson's R with 'Quick DASH': 0.81) as is its sensitivity to change. It didn&#146;t predict the onset of lymphedema. Its predictive capacity for other upper limb complications is low. Conclusions: FACT-B+4-UL is useful in measuring upper limb disability in women surgically treated for breast cancer; but it does not predict the onset of lymphoedema and its predictive capacity for others complications in the upper limb is low (AU)</dc:description>
