<dc:description xml:lang="en">The progressive, world-wide emergence of the natural phenomenon "red tide" normally ignored because of the exceptionality or exotic nature of its sanitary and medical formation, is a risk already present in Spain and Europe, with a certain repetition and under some of the ethiological and clinical forms which were previously unknown to us. Today under the conventional denomination of "Harmful Algae Blooms" (HABs) they have given rise to an extensive investigation, to much bibliography and an almost universal sanitary legislation, as well as a preventive preoccupation of the some states which have become aware that this is a potential and practically unavoidable risk. In this work the basic facts of HABs, their eco-epidemiology and the knowledge of toxic syndroms produced by the marine phytoplancton, represented by some Dinoflagellates and Diatomeas, and Cyanobacteria, are reviewed.</dc:description>
