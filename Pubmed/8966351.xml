<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To compare the efficacy of ondansetron to that of metoclopramide, dehydrobenzperidol and placebo for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a double-blind random study. PATIENTS AND METHOD A total of 100 ASA I, II and III patients undergoing scheduled laparoscopic cholecystectomy were divided into 4 groups according to whether they received one of the following intravenously just prior to anesthetic induction: 1.25 mg dehydrobenzperidol (group D), 10 mg metoclopramide (group M), 4 mg ondansetron (group O) or 2 ml of saline (group P). All received general anesthesia with induction by thiopental, analgesia with fentanyl, muscle relaxation with atracurium and maintenance with oxygen-air and isoflurane. Episodes of nausea and/or vomiting during the first 24 h after surgery were recorded. Treatment was considered effective if no episodes occurred during this period. RESULTS Nine of the 100 patients were excluded from the study. There were no significant differences in demographic variables among the 4 groups. The incidence of PONV was significantly greater in group P than in any of the other groups. There were no significant differences in PONV among groups D, M and O. CONCLUSIONS Ondansetron provides safe, effective prophylaxis for PONV after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but it is not superior to the antiemetic drugs usually used. Its use may be justified in patients in whom dehydrobenzperidol or metoclopramide are contraindicated.</dc:description>
