<dc:description xml:lang="en">Artificial middle ear (AME) is a prosthesis created by the author which substitutes anatomically and functionally middle ear. From the anatomic point of view ossicular chain, tympanum, annulus tympanicus and the inner portion of external auditory meatus are substituted. Both dimensions and vibrating mass of the AME's components are very similar to those of the tympanum and ossicular chain. Physiologically AME substitutes vibrating function of the tympanum and transmission job of the ossicular chain. The neo-tympanum has columellar prosthesis attached to its centre and performs at the same time the task of the chain's superior ligament. AME is intraoperatorily assembled to allow the ideal position of neo-chain. Neo-tympanum can be, if needed, disassembled and reassembled on the bioceramic crown that support it in order to allow the tympanic cavity inspection. AME does not have to suffer periodic changes; it has unlimited life and does not induce inflammatory reactions. It is the result of a project which has been developed through ten years in continuous progress and improvement. Last generation's AME has been implanted in ten patients whose post-operatory control has lasted up to a maximum of 18 months. It performs a level of transmission similar to a residual mean GAP of 8.6 dB, which referred to those cases in which there was a good footplate mobility, comes down to 6.6 dB.</dc:description>
