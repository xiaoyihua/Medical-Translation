<dc:description xml:lang="en">Physical activity has become a priority in the health plans of healthcare authorities in the industrialized world. The importance of physical activity lies in its direct relation with several health outcomes both in healthy individuals and in the general population, independently of age or sex, and in its association with prevalent chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Information on the importance of physical activity in COPD has grown, especially in the last few years, although major questions remain to be answered. The present article aims to provide an update on the most important studies of physical activity in COPD. In addition, we outline current knowledge about the importance of physical activity in the general population and its association with cardiovascular disease, with a view to identifying the strength of evidence currently available on this subject in COPD.</dc:description>
