<dc:description xml:lang="en">Laparoscopic colposacropexy has become a substitute for open surgery in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse. In the same way, robotic assisted surgery is a new step in the evolution of the procedure. In this paper we intend to show our surgical technique and preliminary results. From November 2006 to date, 10 patients have undergone this procedure at the Hospital Clinico San Carlos. The main indication for the operation was existence of symptomatic pelvic prolapse. Both patients with or without hysterectomy have been operated, without making significant differences between them. Preoperative evaluation workout included: cystogram, urinary tract ultrasound and urodynamics in all cases; urinary tract MRI was performed only in selected cases. All patients underwent surgery under general anesthesia, with at least three robotic trocars (8 mm) and one conventional trocar for the assistant; 2 accessory trocars were necessary in some cases, mainly at the beginning of the series. Most procedures in our series were associated with a transobturator suburethral sling for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence or prevention of its appearance after prolapse repair. Our results are comparable to those reported in other larger series in terms of operative time, hospital stay and early or late complications. Pending an evaluation on the long term with larger series, we can include robot assisted colposacropexy among the therapeutic options for symptomatic pelvic floor prolapse repair.</dc:description>
