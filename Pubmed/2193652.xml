<dc:description xml:lang="en">During pregnancy, nutrient body reserves are accumulated, especially fat, which are later mobilized during the breastfeeding period. During the synthesis of maternal milk, the mammary tissue increases its speed to synthesize structural, catalytic and exporting proteins. Due to the above, there is also an increase in the uptake of amino acids as well as the concentration of RNA within that tissue. The demand for energy during the breastfeeding period, exceeds in calories the amount of intake by the mother, causing a loss in body mass; at the same time the exchange in protein balance seems to lead towards degradation. The demand for substrates by the breast tissue is covered by the dietary intake and by other substrates mobilized from the maternal compartments. In the case where amino acids are needed, muscles have become a source of supply. These amino acids are used in the synthesis of proteins and oxidized in order to obtain fatty acids and carbohydrates. When weaning, the muscle mass recovers the amount of proteins in an undefined amount. There is a need for more information concerning the adaptations which occur during the metabolism of proteins during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding; proteins; mammary tissue.</dc:description>
