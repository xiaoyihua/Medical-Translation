<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The role of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) in Non Ulcer Dyspepsia (NUD) has been a controversial issue. OBJECTIVES 1) To determine the frequency of Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (UGE) in patients suffering NUD in whom endoscopy was indicated in our Service, 2) To determine the prevalence of infection by Hp in patients with NUD in whom endoscopy was done, 3) To find an association of clinical and historical facts among patients with and without Hp infection. POPULATION AND SAMPLE 91 consecutive patients, free of esophageal or gastro-intestinal organic disease by endoscopic criteria from a total of 132, in a period of six months. 47 men (X age: 50.4 years, SE 2.6, SD 17.3) and 44 women (X age 49.7 years, SE 2.5, SD 16.8), Levene's Test p = 0.91. Descriptive, comparative and correlation, transverse simple-blind. METHODS 1) two endoscopic biopsies for Hp (antrum and corpus), Rapid Hp Urease Test (modified Christensen protocol) with immediate and 6-hours later readings; 2) two samples for histopathologic diagnosis of Hp (antrum and corpus) with H&amp;E, Giemsa or Warthin-Starring. STATISTICS Levene Test for homogeneity of variance, descriptive statistic tests, ANOVA, chisquare, contingency coefficient, Pearson's "r", Run Tests. Alpha level = 0.05. RESULTS 91 out 132 patients were included (69.9%). Prevalence was greater in men (p = 0.04). "Run Tests" for variables between 0.34 and 0.76, 45 patients were positives (+) for one or two methods (49.5%). There were significative differences between the means for variable "age" for the groups (+) and (-) at the moment of the study (+, mean age 45 years old, SE 2.4; negative tests, mean age 55 years old, SE 2.5, p = 0.005). Wide data dispersion (Coefficient of Pearson = 34.5%). There was association between age symptoms onset and positive tests (mean 40.4 years old, SE 2.6, Coefficient of Pearson 43%) and negative tests (mean 48.9 years old, SE 2.6, Coefficient of Pearson 36%) (p = 0.02). There were also association between age and + tests (p = 0.005). Non statistically significant differences were found between time of evolution of symptoms (p = 0.49), prevalence between sexes of symptoms (although nearly significant, p = 0.06), presence of unespecific pain (p = 0.16), ulcer-like pain (p = 0.46), plenty sensation, distension, satiety (p = 0.64) and differences by sex and age in symptoms (p = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS 1) There would be an overestimation of UGE value in presumable dyspeptic patients, 2) Prevalence of infection agrees with the published values in equivalent populations in our country, 3) Pinfection prevalence was greater in men. 4) It could exist significative differences between age of symptoms onset in infected group (earlier symptoms) and means of age (younger infected people at the moment of this study), but there were very wide data dispersion), 5) Association between age and positiveness would be explained because it would be an accumulative phenomenon noted by us in a previous study 6) There wouldn't be enough evidence to consider Hp infection to be the cause of NUD.</dc:description>
