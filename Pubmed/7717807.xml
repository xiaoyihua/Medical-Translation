<dc:description xml:lang="en">Commercial honeys were analysed to study their quality in the Venezuelan market and were grouped in progressive classes according to their organoleptical and physico-chemical characteristics. For that purpose, 500 honey samples were collected in 1985-1987 in different locations of Venezuela. By sensorial evaluation, 13.4% of the samples were recognized as honey frauds and 86.6% as genuine honey. The analytical results were compared with the standards established in the Venezuelan regulation for honey (COVENIN 2191-84), and 59.8% of the genuine honeys were found to be altered because they failed to fulfil the requirement for moisture content (39.8%), reducing sugars (11.2%), sucrose (17.4%), ash (31.7%), total acidity (25.5%), hydroximethylfurfural (43.2%) and diastase (34.0%). Honey frauds never fulfilled the requirements for hydroximethylfurfural and diastase. The high values found for acidity and ash content in genuine honeys with only one altered characteristic, reveal the need to review the established requirements in the national regulation for honey. It is suggested to use the nitrogen content of honey to detect honey frauds in Venezuela.</dc:description>
