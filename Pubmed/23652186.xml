<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate the differences in inflammation markers and cardiovascular risk factors in a group of school-aged children with and without excessive adiposity. To examine the relationship between adiposity, inflammation, and cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS Cross-sectional study of 285 school children (8-12 years old). Adiposity (body mass index, BMI, total body fat, TBF, and waist circumference), inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 1β [IL-1β], interleukin 6 [IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF-α]) and cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed. Mean differences were calculated and multiple regression models were made. RESULTS Obese children had higher concentrations of CRP and IL-1β; children with abdominal obesity also had higher CRP levels. A higher BMI was associated with higher blood pressure, and higher total cholesterol, triglycerides-TAG, and insulin concentrations, and with lower HDL-cholesterol. The CRP and IL-1β concentrations correlated significantly with the three adiposity indices. The IL-6 concentrations were associated with TAG, and IL-1β with HDL-cholesterol concentration, after adjustment by BMI. DISCUSSION In a group of school-aged Mexican children, obesity increases cardiovascular risk and inflammation. Both IL-6 and IL-1β appear to be factors involved in lipid alterations in these children. More research is needed in order to explore the role of subclinical inflammation in the development of cardiovascular alterations that have already been described in Mexican children with obesity.</dc:description>
