<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Focal glandular atypia in needle prostatic biopsies consists of scarce glands with architectural and cytological features suggestive but not conclusive of malignancy. Although this is a relatively frequent finding, the advantage of carrying out additional sections has not been extensively explored. The objective of this review is to define the usefulness of performing multiple additional sections in needle biopsies showing areas with focal glandular atypia. METHODS Thirty-eight patients in whom prostate needle biopsies were performed and showed focal glandular atypia in routine sections were selected for this study. In all biopsies there were atypia only in one isolated microscopic field. Each case originally had three cuts of three microns each per slide. In all cases three additional slides were made with three additional cuts. Thus, each case wound up with a total of 12 cuts (the original 3, and additional 9). RESULTS The average age of the patients was 65 years old, and the average specific prostate antigen was 8.4 ng/ml. The additional sections made it possible to establish a definitive diagnosis of malignancy in nine (22.5%) of the 38 cases, because they made more apparent the architectural and cytological features of prostatic carcinoma. In the other 29 biopsies the area with glandular atypia was less apparent or disappeared altogether. CONCLUSIONS The additional sections are useful for the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in one of every four or five needle biopsies with focal glandular atypia. Making additional cuts in these biopsies is a quick and low-cost method that could be practiced routinely, especially if immunohistochemical studies are not available.</dc:description>
