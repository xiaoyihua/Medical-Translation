<dc:description xml:lang="en">Neurological manifestations, secondary to perfusion problems, vasogenic edema or small infarcts, are common in thrombotic purpura. Moreover, they are the first symptoms of the disease in 50% of patients. We report a 50 year-old woman who presented with focal intermittent neurological signs with aphasia and right hemiparesis, who then developed progressive impairment of consciousness with stupor and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Despite the severe neurological impairment, first neuroimaging studies were normal. A second magnetic resonance imaging showed small cortical infarcts, that were visible only with the technique of diffusion weighted imaging. The standard electroencephalograms showed focal left temporal slowing and low voltage first and then diffuse slowing accordind to the clinical condition of the patients. She was treated with plasmapheresis and had a partial neurological recovery at the fifth day, but died at the twelfth day of therapy.</dc:description>
