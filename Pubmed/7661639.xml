<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Three cases of complete epispadial urethral duplication are described. The limitations of the preoperative evaluation and the importance of a suitable surgical treatment are underscored. METHODS The patients comprised three boys aged 2, 6 and 7 years. The main cause for consultation was an epispadial opening in the dorsal part of the glans penis in three cases, dorsal curvature of the penis in one and urinary dribbling in the other patient. All the patients were evaluated by cystography and cystoscopy. Only two patients underwent surgery: total excision of the accessory urethra and surgical correction of the chordee via a combined penile retropubic transvesical approach. RESULTS Cystography and cystoscopy showed complete duplication of the urethra only in two cases; one had coexisting vertebral, cardiac and intestinal anomalies. CONCLUSIONS Difficulties are encountered in diagnosing this anomaly correctly since the true extent and trajectory of the accessory urethra often cannot be determined. This anomaly warrants total excision of the accessory urethra and surgical correction of the chordee.</dc:description>
