<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The purpose was to investigate the etiology and epidemiological characteristics of a food-borne infection outbreak in a school dining room. SUBJECTS AND METHOD Retrospective cohort study. Information about gastrointestinal symptoms and the use of the service of the school dining room was obtained. Coprocultures and detection of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin in stool samples by means of reverse passive latex agglutination were carried out in 7 ill persons. Relative risks (RR) at 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS The attack rate was 17.5% (48/275) and the probability of becoming sick was higher in students who ate at the second shift than in those eating at the first one (RR=13.8; 95% CI: 4.4-43.1). C perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 6 stool samples from patients. A high recount of C perfringens was not observed in those food samples kept frozen after their elaboration. CONCLUSIONS The determination of C perfringens enterotoxin in feces allowed to confirm the etiologic agent of the outbreak.</dc:description>
