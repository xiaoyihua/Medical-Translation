<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The prevalence of hereditary ataxia in Holguín, Cuba, is 43 per 100,000 inhabitants, but in some regions reaches 503 per 100,000 inhabitants, a figure never previously recorded in the international literature. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the part played by non-cerebellar structures and vias in causing some of the clinical signs of the disorder by means of clinico-electro physiological correlation. PATIENTS AND METHODS A neurological examination, peripheral nerve conduction studies and somato-sensorial evoked potentials of the median and posterior tibial nerves were done in 70 patients with type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia. RESULTS The commonest clinical signs were ataxia on walking, dysarthria, dysmetria and adiadochokinesia. Correlation analysis showed that the variable most significantly correlated with the degree of ataxia and Romberg's sign was latency of the P40 component, whilst tendon reflexes were best correlated with H reflex latency. However, the duration of the disease was not found to have statistical correlation. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that degeneration of long peripheral nerves and sensory paths contributes to the degree of ataxia and other clinical signs. At present no correlation has been found between the duration of the illness and increasing electrophysiological changes, and therefore seems not to have a major effect on neurodegenerative mechanisms.</dc:description>
