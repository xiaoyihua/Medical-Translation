<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To evaluate the epidemiological aspects, diagnosis, therapeutical procedures, and factors of poor prognosis in patients with intraocular foreign bodies. METHODS A descriptive and retrospective study carried out at The Hospital Comarcal del Bierzo (Leon), between June 1996 and May 2001, with an average follow-up period of 2 years. It comprises 86 patients affected by serious ocular traumatism who required hospitalization and surgery, 25 of whom had an intraocular foreign body (30%). RESULTS The average age was 46, and 88% were males. Accidents at work account for 72% of cases, domestic accidents for 24%, and leisure activities for 4%. The nature of the material causing the accident was metallic in 80% of cases, and non-metallic materials in 20%. In 60% of patients, the final visual acuity was less than 0.5. CONCLUSIONS Labour accidents cause ocular traumas with foreign body entrance. In most cases foreign bodies have a metallic composition. Diagnosis was made through direct exploration, roentgenography, CT scan and ultrasonography. We proceeded to carry out urgent admission, antitetanus and antibiotic prophylaxis as well as reconstruction of ocular globe. Main bad-prognosis factors were a diminished previous visual acuity, the presence of afferent pupillary defect, organic composition of foreign body and the occurrence of late complications.</dc:description>
