<dc:description xml:lang="en">Oligoelements such as copper, magnesium, manganese and zinc are involved in several metabolic, enzymatic and immunological processes. They are also important for the integral tissue proteins and could be involved in gene expression regulation. The deficiency of these essential elements hampers the appropriate function of the body and may cause various diseases. Therefore, it is important to guarantee the incorporation of these trace elements in the diet, but the quantity provided is not always adequate for the optimum body performance. Currently, conventional nutritional supplements have two major problems. The first one is attributed to the association of inorganic salts with metals which might cause low absorption and gastric intolerance. The second problem is caused when several metals are present in a formulation which could lead to possible antagonistic interactions. For this reason, this study explores the development of cations (i.e., copper, zinc, magnesium and manganese) and amino acids (i.e., glycine and asparagine) new complexes formulated into compacts for oral administration. In each reaction, ligands were linked to non-antagonistic cation pairs. The complex formation was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and powder X-ray diffraction analyses. Compact disintegration and in-vitro dissolution tests for these complexes were also determined.</dc:description>
