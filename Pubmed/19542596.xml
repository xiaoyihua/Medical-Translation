<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE We describe one case of recurrent lithiasis associated with anatomical alteration of the renal pelvis related to previous surgery. METHODS/RESULTS The patient presented a urinary tract infection episode, complicated with pyonephrosis and septicemia. In the intravenous urography, infectious radiopaque pyelocaliceal multiple and complex lithiasis can be seen, as well as kidney hydronephrosis grade III-IV. Important pyelic sclerosis secondary to previous surgery on the renal unit was seen. Nephrectomy was performed with lower pole nephro-lithotomy and reconstruction of the upper urinary tract through ureterocalicostomy. Two and a half years after surgery, control urogram shows absence of urolithiasis and a slight delay of renal function. CONCLUSIONS Ureterocalicostomy is indicated in cases of ureteropelvic junction obstruction associated with intrarenal pelvis caused by alterations of fusion, rotation or location of kidney. It is also indicated in cases of severe peripyelic fibrosis secondary to previous pyeloplasty failure or renal surgery. In our case, in addition to the infectious component of lithiasis, an anatomical alteration, probably secondary to previous surgery, caused the chronification of lithiasis. Facing such suspicion a surgical management was undertaken to eliminate the lithiasis and get a correct derivation of the working area of the kidney, in order to prevent further recurrences.</dc:description>
