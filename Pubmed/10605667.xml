<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The relationship between leptin and insulin sensitivity, sexual steroids and insulin concentrations in women with polycystic ovary syndrome is still controversial. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between insulin levels, insulin resistance parameters and serum leptin concentrations in healthy and polycystic ovary syndrome women. PATIENTS AND METHODS 33 hyperandrogenic polycystic ovary syndrome women (GHA) and 27 healthy women (GS) were included in this study. Leptin, insulin, sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), testosterone and estradiol concentrations were determined in a basal sample. Body mass index, waist diameter and waist to hip ratio were recorded. Insulin sensitivity was calculated by means of insulin tolerance test and glycemia/insulinemia ratio. RESULTS The leptin concentration was not different between GHA and GS. Insulin levels and free testosterona index (FTI) were higher in GHA than GS (p &lt; 0.01). The glycemia/insulinemia ratio, SHBG levels, and insulin sensitivity were lower in GHA (p &lt; 0.01). In both groups positive correlations between leptin concentration and body mass index (p &lt; 0.01), waist diameter (p &lt; 0.01), insulin levels (p &lt; 0.01) and glycemia/insulinemia ratio (p &lt; 0.01) were observed. Only GHA showed correlation between insulin sensitivity and leptin concentration (p &lt; 0.02). SHBG and leptin levels were not correlated. CONCLUSIONS The leptin concentration was not different between GHA and healthy women, although they are metabolically different. This phenomenon could be due to the fact that in hyperandrogenic women the effects of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia counteract each other.</dc:description>
