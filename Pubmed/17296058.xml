<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study analyses the influence of family communication and parental valuation of school on adolescent violent behaviour at school. By means of a structural equation model, both its direct and indirect influence through school and family self-esteem of the adolescent and his attitude towards school authority are analysed. The sample is composed of 665 adolescents whose ages range from 12 to 16 years old. The results confirm the existence of an indirect relationship but not direct influence of the family on school violence. The attitude of the adolescent towards school authority is the mediator variable which shows the strongest direct effect on school violence. Also, the two dimensions of self-esteem considered are significant intermediate variables. These results and their implications are analysed.</dc:description>
