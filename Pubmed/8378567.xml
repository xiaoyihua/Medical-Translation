<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to show our experience in the treatment of aneurysms of the ascending aorta in patients with previous aortic valve surgery. METHODS We studied retrospectively the clinical characteristics and operative methods of 9 patients who underwent surgery for aneurysm of the ascending aorta after previous aortic valve replacement. RESULTS Time interval between the first and subsequent reoperation was 8.4 +/- 3.5 years (range 4-15 years). During the first operation there were 5 cases who presented with aortic regurgitation and dilatation of the ascending aorta. Isolated valvular aortic replacement was performed in these patients. Two patients underwent valvular replacement and implantation of supracoronary aortic graft. In two other cases valvular replacement was done with wedge resection of the aortic sinuses. Reoperation was performed because to the following reasons: valvular prosthesis disfunction and aneurysm of the ascending aorta (3), valvular prosthesis disfunction and aneurysm of the aortic remnant located between the prosthesis and the supracoronary aortic graft (2), thrombosis of the prosthesis (1), dissection of the ascending aorta (2) and superior vena cava syndrome (1). There was one hospital death. Another patient died after 26 months because of graft infection. The other 7 patients are in functional class I. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that an aggressive surgical approach should be adopted in patients with degenerative aortic regurgitation and moderate dilatation of the ascending aorta because of the rapid progression of the aortic disease. We advise complete replacement of the aortic root.</dc:description>
