<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Biologic therapies have been a major breakthrough in the treatment of psoriasis because they are more selective and have a better short-term and medium-term safety profile. There are reliable data to support both the efficacy and the safety of these drugs. However, it is always useful to report the clinical experience of dermatologists who are experts in the use of biologic agents to treat psoriasis, particularly with regard to their safety. MATERIAL AND METHODS We present the results of a survey administered to the members of Spanish Psoriasis Group and based on a series of questions referring to the clinical safety of these agents. A total of 988 patients treated with efalizumab, infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab were reported by 15 members of the group. RESULTS There was a particularly high proportion of reactions (34%) to infliximab infusions. Blood test abnormalities were detected in 13.25% of patients and infections in 12.24%, with one case of pulmonary tuberculosis. Attention is drawn to the adverse effects profile of efalizumab: de novo arthritis in 5.8% and rebound in 20.9% of patients. CONCLUSION The safety data provided by our study should be taken into account in view of the large number of patients recruited by dermatologists experienced in the use of this type of therapy.</dc:description>
