<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper describes the influence of early, severe and extended malnutrition on physical growth, weight and stature in a group of 33 children controlled in their development up to the age of 5 years. The program of treatment was mainly directed to promote the correction of nutritional deficiencies and to educate mothers in feeding practices. Those cases where it was not possible to obtain satisfactory collaboration from the family to the program offered, were excluded. The program that was carried out allowed to maintain, practically without relapses, a fast recovery of the weight and of the apparently good nutritional state of the children. It is also important to stress the absence of infectious diseases and gastrointestinal disturbances in spite of the fact that all patients returned to the same environment they belonged.</dc:description>
