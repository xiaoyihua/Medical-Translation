<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To analyse the status of iron deposits at diagnosis in patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM). PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included twenty consecutive patients with IM. Haemoglobin, MCV, serum iron and serum ferritin were determined in each case. Perls stain was used to evaluate iron deposits in bone marrow samples attained by aspiration or biopsy. An attempt was made to correlate the semiquantitative estimation of bone marrow iron with the peripheral blood values connected with iron deposits. RESULTS Anaemia was present in 15 patients, but in most cases MCV and serum iron were normal. Iron deposits in bone marrow aspirate could be evaluated only in one patient as in the remainders no material was obtained. The semiquantitative estimation of iron in bone marrow biopsy samples showed diminished or absent deposits in 15 cases (75%). In contrast, none of the patients had decreased serum ferritin levels. No correlation was found between bone marrow iron and the peripheral blood values related to iron deposits. CONCLUSION Most IM patients have decreased bone marrow iron deposits at diagnosis. However, as in chronic myelogenous leukaemia and in essential thrombocytopenia, such finding does not mean a true iron deficiency status.</dc:description>
