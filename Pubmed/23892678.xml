<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Health professionals who care for patients with imported diseases often lack enough training. The aim of the study is to assess the knowledge of Chagas disease among doctors and nurses attending at-risk pregnant women in our province. METHOD descriptive study through a performed anonymous and voluntary knowledge questionnaire for 278 physicians and nurses working at maternity and children's health services in the three hospitals in the province. In Poniente Hospital was established in 2007 a program of screening for the disease in pregnant women. For statistical analysis, quantitative variables were described using the mean and standard deviation. For comparison of qualitative variables we used the chi-square test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. Differences in age and years of experience depending on the hospital were measured by Brown-Forsy the robust test. RESULTS 116 (41.7%) professionals agreed to participate in the study. 80 (69%) were women and 36 (31%) men, mean age 36.78 years. By professional categories, physicians have a mean of 73.9% correct responses, the nurses 50.7%. Poniente Hospital had the highest percentage of correct answers on aspects of the geographical distribution of the disease (73.7%), the mechanisms of transmission (86%) and diagnosis (82.5%). CONCLUSIONS The Poniente Hospital professionals generally have a better Knowledge about Chagas disease compared with two other professionals hospitals, which probably is related to the existence of the screening program for the disease.</dc:description>
