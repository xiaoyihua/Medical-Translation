<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Obstruction of the upper respiratory tract is the most common cause of the sleep apnea syndrome (SAS). Different methods have been used to localize this obstruction and give the appropriate treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of respiratory endoscopy performed during arousal to identify the site and cause of the obstruction in patients with severe rhoncopathy and/or SAS. METHODS Sixty-eight patients with acute rhoncopathy were included in the study with 36 also fulfilling polysomnographic criteria of SAS (36%). The endoscopy was performed via the upper respiratory tract with inspiratory collapse at each level being evaluated in both easy respiration and during the Müller manoeuver. RESULTS The site and cause of the obstruction was identified in 61 patients (90%, CI 95%, 79.9 +/- 95.8). In most cases the Müller manoeuver best demonstrated the collapse. The predominant obstruction was in the nasopharyngeal region (72%, mainly associated to changes in soft palate), followed by obstruction in the oropharyngeal region at the base of the tongue (29%). Multiple localization of the obstruction was observed in 19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopy performed during arousal may allow the identification of the site and cause of obstruction in most of the patients with rhoncopathy and sleep apnea syndrome, thus aiding in the selecting the most adequate treatment for the patient.</dc:description>
