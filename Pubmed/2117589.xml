<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the rural environment investigations on vaccination coverage during the daily consultation of Primary Care is feasible. For knowing the real levels and improve the situation, infant vaccination coverage was studied in a rural township with hamlet (small villages) by interviewing the parents and checking the vaccination card. Demographics variables were also analysed looking for different coverage according to these characteristics. One hundred and five children from 0 to 14 years were studied. Relative risks were calculated for the situation of no vaccination. The 69% have got vaccination card. Vaccination rates for Tetanus, Oral Polio, Triple Virus (Measles, Rubella, Mumps) and Rubella (73.3%, 73.3%, 75.5% and 83.3% respectively) were not enough for its eradication. The older children and those who have the biggest family size, showed less rates. Those who live in hamlets have a greater risk to not to be vaccinate, being able to perform "bags" of the deficient vaccination. This survey has allowed to get a complete register of infant vaccination coverage and start correcting actions of the deficiencies noticed.</dc:description>
