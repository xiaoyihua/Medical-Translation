<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To describe the experience and results of the implementation of a faculty development program for professors of Medicine in the Medical Education Certificate program developed at the School of Medicine, Pontificia Uniersidad Catolica de Chile. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a descriptive, cross-sectional, quantitative and qualitative study. The population consisted of all graduates of the program until 2011. A questionnaire with open and closed-ended questions was applied, exploring different levels of impact using the Kirkpatrick evaluation model. RESULTS Over 97% expressed a high degree of satisfaction (Kirkpatrick level 1). Most respondents reported changes in learning, knowledge and teaching skills (Kirkpatrick Level 2) with statistically significant differences in retrospective pre-post questionnaires 93% reported having improved their teaching performance generally, and 85% in a specific performance (Kirkpatrick Level 3). At level 4 of the Kirkpatrick evaluation model, most perceived an increased interest in teaching and 69% reported being valued more highly at the institutional level. Five categories emerged from the qualitative analysis: value given to teaching and of training in teaching, importance of teaching skills, the contribution of teaching to the professional role, contribution to personal development and strengthening of the academic community. CONCLUSIONS The effects of this faculty development program in medical education have been positive. Professors of Medicine, in addition to improving their teaching performance, perceived changes in personal development, in their role as physicians, in the academic community and in the institution.</dc:description>
