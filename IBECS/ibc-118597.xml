<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective. The present study evaluated the reproducibility and validity of two models of receivers for the Global Positioning System (GPS). Validity was assessed by comparing the distance recorded by the GPS receivers with the known distance. Method. Six young players (177.6 ± 6.2 cm; 76.6 ± 3.2 kg) performed three routes with different characteristics: 1) 100 m in the athletics track (number of "sprints" = 120); 2) 400 m in the athletics track (number of "sprints" = 60) and 3) 100 m with changes of direction (number of "sprints" = 120), using equipment Garmin© Forerunner 405 and Polar© RS800. Results. Regarding linear routes (100 and 400 m), no differences were detected using ANOVA two-way (distance and speed) between the known distance and distance recorded by GPS receivers analyzed (p &gt; 0.05). Regarding non-linear route of, significant differences were observed between the known distance and recorded distance by the GPS receivers (p &lt; 0.05). There was also a significant difference between the distance recorded by Polar© RS800 and Garmin© Forerunner 405 for the non-linear route (p &lt; 0.05). Analysis of the limits of agreement reinforces the limitation of equipment in relation to accuracy for the non-linear route. Conclusion. These data suggest that the GPS receivers evaluated showed acceptable level of accuracy for linear routes, however, the accuracy of such devices on non-linear routes was limited (AU)</dc:description>
