<dc:description xml:lang="en">An analysis was made on the incidence of Culicidae in Boyeros municipality, City of Havana from 1994 to 1996 based on the requirements of the national program for eradication of Aedes aegypti. A total of 13 species was detected in which Aedes mediovittatus predominated during 3 years of study, followed by Culex quinquefasciatus whereas for the first time Aedes albopictus species was found in the territory. People's Councils Wajay, Santiago de las Vegas and Armada exhibited the highest values of infestation by Culicidae in the municipality, therefore, they required that anti-Aedes program, operators paid more attention to this situation. It was found that depots preferred by Culicidae for breeding were larval traps followed by low tanks in 1994 and 1995 and by other reservoirs in 1996. A mediovittatus preferred larval traps whereas Cx. quinquefasciatus preferred low tanks except in 1996 when this species was mostly found in other tanks. 93% of all test-positive reservoirs found were colonized by only one species, whereas 7% presented larvae from 2 species or more. A. mediovittatus and C. quinquefasciatus were the most related, above all in low tanks.</dc:description>
