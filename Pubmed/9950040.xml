<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Gene Trak colorimetric hybridization method (GENE TRAK Systems, 31 New York Avenue, Framingham, M.A.) was compared with conventional methodology proposed by International Commission for Microbiological Standard Foods (ICMSF) for the detection of Salmonella in samples of broiler feed and raw materials of vegetal and animal origin used in its formulation. In this study 249 samples which included inoculated samples and 9 uninoculated samples were studied. On 240 uninoculated samples, 62.9% resulted free of Salmonella, 27.9% were positive for both methods and 9.2% were positive by Gene Trak but it couldn't be confirmed by conventional methodology after five determinations. This methodology is presented as an interesting method of screening with important advantages in comparison to conventional methodology: facility for processing a big number of samples with few material expenses, less time to get results and high sensibility.</dc:description>
