<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE The aims of this study were to evaluate the relationship between pediatric health care visits and immunization coverage. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study was made in a rural health care center. All of the children between 3 months and 14 years old were included. The data were obtained directly from their clinical histories. The quality of the health care visits was evaluated according to the fulfillment of A.E.P. patterns of health care. RESULTS We observed that 87% of infants, 74% of preschool children and 74% of school children were correctly vaccinated. We observed a significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) coverage of the MMR vaccine in respect to the first three doses of DPT and OPV vaccines; and the coverage of OPV and DT at 6 years old was even lower. The quality of health care visits was good in 67% of infants, 10% of preschool children and 12% of school children. There was a relationship between incomplete vaccinations and missed visits (p &lt; 0.001) and also with low quality health care visits (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS We conclude that there is a significant relationship between missed visits and low quality health care visits with delayed immunization.</dc:description>
