<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors present three cases of pregnant women with symptomatic severe mitral stenosis with a mean age of 28.6 +/- 2.3 years, and during 27.6 +/- 1.52 weeks of pregnancy. Two patients were in class III and one in class IV of the New York Heart Association (NYHA). All patients had a mitral valvular area equal or less than 1 cm2, with a Wilkins score of 7 to 9 and mitral insufficiency grade I in two cases; two, had severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (mean &gt; 50 mm Hg). After Percutaneous Mitral Valvuloplasty (PMV) the mitral valve measured by 2D echocardiography increased form 0.83 +/- 0.2 cm2 to 1.8 +/- 0.15 cm2; the mean transmitral gradient diminished from 13 +/- 3.4 mm Hg to 3.6 +/- 1.15 mm Hg; the degree of mitral insufficiency was no modified in neither case. Hemodynamic results revealed increasing of the mitral valve from 0.83 +/- 0.18 cm2 to 2.23 +/- 0.3 cm2; the mean mitral gradient decreased from 21.6 +/- 9 to 4.3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg; the mean left atrial pressure from 30 +/- 12 to 12.3 +/- 4 mm Hg; the mean pressure of the pulmonary artery diminished suddenly from 44.3 +/- 16 to 25.6 +/- 11 mm Hg. The average fluoroscopic time was 15.3 +/- 3 minutes. There were no complications. The patients were discharged 48 hours after the procedure and continued their pregnancies in class I NYHA, which resolved in a non complicated vaginal delivery with normal products. We conclude that PMV is a safe and useful therapy in pregnant patient with severe mitral stenosis refractory to medical treatment.</dc:description>
