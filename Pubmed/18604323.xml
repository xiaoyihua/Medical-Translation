<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE [corrected] To assess the body image perception and to compare the results with the true measurements in a group of university students. SUBJECTS Participants were 28 volunteer females recruited from the degree in Human Nutrition and Dietetic from the University of the Basque Country (Spain). All participants gave their informed consent. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 22.01 (2.12) years (20,23-28,25). METHODS Anthropometric measurement estimated directly and the derived indexes were compared with reference values. The assessment of body image perception was made using a somatomorphic software. The difference between the perceived measurements and the ideals were used as measure of body dissatisfaction. Data were analyzed using SPSS vs 14.0. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Prevalence of overweight and obesity was 10.7%, and of under-weight was 70.1%. The body fat perception was well, while the perception of the muscle index was significantly different from the real measure (3.91+/-2.75 kg/m2; P&lt;0.001). The level of body dissatisfaction was higher for the body fat (6.00+/-8.61%; P&lt;0.001) than for the muscle index (1.65+/-2.82 kg/m2; P&lt;0.01). This result can be justified for the present canons of beauty and for the overvaluation of the thinness. Additional research is needed to further know the relation between female body image and true measurements of body composition. Future research will allow to compare the results with other populations.</dc:description>
