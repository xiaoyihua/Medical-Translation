<dc:description xml:lang="en">The warts produced by virus Papova, provedly cancerous, have immunological characteristics that allow to establish some analogies with cancer. Its immunotherapy is studied with levamisole and by means of a delayed immunity reaction "in situ" with regulated intensity. The level of delayed immunity in the patient with warts is established by quantitative DNCB test, finding that the same is impaired in 60% of men and 87% of women. The levamisol therapy cures 54% of warts. The patients that not cure but improve their delayed immunity level after the treatment with levamisol, are submitted to external application of DNCB, using a concentration calculated on the quantitative test results. With regard to their delayed immunity we introduce a new group of patients: the hiperergic type or reactive to 2,5 microgram of DNCB that cures their warts by the sole action of the test. Once obtained the curve of the distribution of delayed immunity values in the warts population before and after the levamisole therapy, we observe that the first is identical to that of cancer patients. In view of the tight relation among diseases with impaired delayed immunity, such as warts, herpes, aphtas, piodermitis and cancer (residual or postsurgical), we propose the same management, control and immunotherapy for all of them.</dc:description>
