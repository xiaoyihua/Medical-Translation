<dc:description xml:lang="en">Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) affects public health and directly compromises the quality of life of hundreds of women, with a detrimental effect on their physical and mental health. Approximately 50% of RPL are not associated to any of the currently known etiology and will be considered idiopathic. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the expression of annexin 5 (ANXA5), a protein found on the trophoblastic surface, plays a fundamental role in the development of pregnancy due to its immunomodulator and anticoagulant function at the placentary level. Some genetic haplotypes of ANXA5 are associated to alterations in the expression of this gene, such as haplotype M2 which is associated to a decrease in the expression of ANXA5. The presence of this haplotype is related to the following conditions occurring during pregnancy: RPL, foetal intrauterine growth restriction, low child weight at birth, preeclampsia and maternal pulmonary thromboembolism. This review describes the structure, function and genetic expression of ANXA5, as well as its possible implication in RPL.</dc:description>
