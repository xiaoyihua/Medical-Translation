<dc:description xml:lang="en">An analysis is made of 24 cases of primitive lithiasis of the biliary tracts, viz; 10 of diffuse intrahepatic lithiasis, 9 of intrahepatic lithiasis localized in one of the ducts; and 5 of extrahepatic lithiasis. The most common cause were stenosis (14 cases) generally of idiopathic or congenital nature, followed by those of iatrogenic or tumoral origin. There were also cases of isolated or diffuse anomalus dilatation of the biliary ducts. A lithogenetic bile as well as infectious processes are rather considered secondary factors. The diagnosis of the real nature of the condiction was usually established in the postoperative period, this being an explanation why repeated surgery was so common (75%). There was a high postoperative mortality in the diffuse forms owing to severe manifestations of biliary sepsis perpetuated by the stones. Depending upon the individual cases the following procedures are proposed: 1) Biliodigestive anastomosis 2) Sphinteropapilloplasty 3) Dilatation and calibration of the stenosis 4) Postoperative instrumental extraction of calculi. The last-named procedure was carried out in 58% of the cases and result in an improvement in the serious prognosis. Primitive lithiasis should always be borne in mind when undertaking surgery of the biliary tracts in order to avoid additional surgery.</dc:description>
