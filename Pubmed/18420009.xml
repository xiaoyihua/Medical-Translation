<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Despite the benefits of highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on morbidity and mortality, some seropositive patients refuse to accept this treatment. Prisons provide easier access to this population. OBJECTIVE To determine the psychosocial characteristics of prisoners who refuse HAART. METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study in 580 seropositive prisoners in 3 hospitals in Andalusia (Spain). The dependent variable was being under treatment or refusal to be so. The independent variables were sociodemographic and psychosocial factors related to the prison environment and clinical factors related to health status and drug addiction. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine which factors were related with refusal to accept HAART. RESULTS HAART was recommended to 73.1% of seropositive prisoners. This treatment was refused by 23.1% of these prisoners and was accepted by 76.9%. The factors related to refusal to accept HAART were high viral load, worse self-perceived health status, a greater number of stays in prison, and being visited by persons other than relatives. CONCLUSIONS There is a group of prisoners with specific characteristics that refuse HAART. Specific interventions should be performed in these prisoners to make them aware of the effects of their decision on the course of their disease.</dc:description>
