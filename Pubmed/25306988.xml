<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report two cases of prostate sarcoma and perform a review of the published literature. METHODS / RESULTS The first case is a 21 year old patient who presented acute urine retention and lung metastases on diagnosis. He was diagnosed by TURP of rhabdomyosarcoma of the prostate dying 1 month after surgery. The second case was a 33 years old male who presented to the emergency room with anal pain, urinary symptoms, hematochezia and loss of 20 kg over the past 3 months. Abdominal CT scan showed an 11 x 10 x 9 cm mass in the lower pelvis that infiltrated the bladder and rectum, being unable to define its origin. CA 19.9, CEA and PSA were normal. The suspected diagnosis was a prostate sarcoma infiltrating rectum and bladder. A pelvic exenteration was performed with a wet colostomy. The pathologic diagnosis was a high grade sarcoma not clearly identified of the prostate. He was treated with adriamycin as adjuvant chemotherapy, having local recurrence, nodal involvement and multiple pulmonary metastases after 3 months of follow up CONCLUSIONS Prostate sarcomas are rare tumors. This makes difficult to know their natural history. Their rapid progression and systemic spread, despite multimodal treatment, gives a mean survival of 24 months. Main survival factors are grade, a complete resection of the tumor and a low local stage. There is a need to find new chemotherapy protocols to increase survival rates as it has been shown in extremities sarcomas.</dc:description>
