<dc:description xml:lang="en">The clinical spectrum of acute hepatitis B virus infection is very broad, with clinical manifestations that range from anicteric and sub-clinical hepatitis to severe acute icteric hepatitis and even, in some cases, to fulminant hepatitis. Diagnosis depends to a large extent on the degree of clinical suspicion of hepatitis, establishing the aetiological origin of the B virus through the study of serological markers and/or DNA in the blood. Although in the majority of cases there is a favourable evolution of acute hepatitis B virus infection, with spontaneous resolution of the clinical manifestations in 4-8 weeks, progression to chronic hepatitis is not unusual in certain cases, above all in infancy. No specific treatment exists for acute hepatitis B virus infection that would reduce its severity or prevent its evolution into chronic hepatitis. However, relative rest and the administration of an hypercaloric diet are recommended. In cases of severe acute hepatitis hospital admission should be recommended; in cases of fulminant hepatitis, admission to the intensive care unit for intensive monitoring and evaluation of a liver transplantation is recommended if spontaneous improvement does not occur. This paper reviews briefly the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of acute hepatitis B virus infection.</dc:description>
