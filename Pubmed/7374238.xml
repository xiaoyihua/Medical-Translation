<dc:description xml:lang="en">A case of autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with chronic ulcerative colitis in a 28-year-old woman is reported. Immunological studies showed a strongly positive direct Coombs test of IgG type and a non-specific pannagglutinin antibody. This immunological pattern remained for 10 months instead of the medical treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine. A subtotal colectomy with ileo-rectostomy was performed and the patient experienced a greater clinical improvement, though the total negativity of the immunitary alteration was not obtained. Weak immunological disturbances continued 19 months after the surgical procedure. A short review of the literature is presented and a total of 39 cases of erythorcitic autoimmunization (with or without hemolysis) published up to the present time have been found. Lastly, various etiopathogenic theories in relation to this complication are mentioned.</dc:description>
