<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors present a case of a patient with recurring stones suffering from disectasia of the vesical neck. Two of the stones situated in the navicular cavity were easily removed by means of Zeiss' loop without any complications and therefore the authors think that this simple method may be used when attempts to remove the stone by means of forceps or other techniques have failed and before proceeding to an external meatotomy which in always more traumatic and this system may even be applied as the initial and best method in these patients. After having made a review of the bibliography at their disposal, the authors have found no descriptions of any case in which this method was used, as in the cases of ureteral lithiasis.</dc:description>
