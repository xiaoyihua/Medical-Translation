<dc:description xml:lang="en">Maintenance of the K(+) gradient between endolymph and perilymph is essential for normal hearing and depends primarily on the activity of the stria vascularis. Abundant Na-K-ATPase in marginal strial cells provides a pumping mechanism for preserving the K(+) level of the endolymph and consequently, the endocochlear potential. Fibrocytes in the lateral wall of the cochlea supply K(+) to the strial pump, via gap junctions, by recycling back into the stria the ions that efflux from the scala media during auditory transduction. The lateral wall of the cochlea encloses five types of fibrocytes, differentiated by their location, structural features and content of enzymes mediating or energizing ion transport. The disruption of the gap junction bonds by connexin mutations and other pathologies leads to an interruption of K(+) recirculation pathways. The expression of cochlin and otoraplin, proteins that participate in structural or regulatory functions in the inner ear, suggests more diversity and complexity of the mesenchymal tissues than envisioned previously. The presence of otospiralin, a novel protein found in fibrocytes of spiral limbus, spiral ligament and subepithelial regions of the vestibule, represent a critical finding since that protein has been shown to be essential for the survival of the hair cells and supporting cells of the inner ear. A more profound knowledge and understanding of the function of inner ear fibrocytes will provide a new and promising aetiopathogenic approach to the treatment of inner ear disorders.</dc:description>
