<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE We present a case of intrarrenal pseudoaneuysm after percutaneous nephrolithotomy. The treatment was selective embolization of the pseudoaneurysm. We discuss the role of computerized angiotomography and angiography in these cases. We present a review of the related literature. METHODS A computerized angiotomography (angio CT) was performed because of suspicion of a delayed vascular lesion after percutaneous nephrolithectomy. Faced with the findings of the angio CT an selective renal artery arteriography and selective embolization was performed. RESULTS The angiotomography shows an enhanced nodular contrast in the lower third of the left kidney with a scarred area at this level suggestive of hemorrhage due to vascular lesion.Through puncture of the right common femoral artery, arteriography was performed on the left renal artery with, objectifying an amputated artery related to the bleeding situation in the calyx. After localization of the point of hemorrhage, the vessel was embolized with a 3 mm metallic microspiral GCD, 6 cm in length After embolization, the evolution of the patient was satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS Intrarenal pseudoaneurysm is the most frequent cause of late bleeding after percutaneous nephrolithotomy. The most common symptom is hematuria that can be severe and require active treatment in order to inhibit the hemorrhage. In these cases, computerized angiotomography and angiography take on a very important diagnostic role, the latter offering the possibility to treat the hemorrhage through selective embolization of the pseudoaneurysm.</dc:description>
