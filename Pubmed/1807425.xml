<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine by questionnaire the incidence of effective vaccination against tetanus in the population aged over 30 years attending a health centre. As a secondary objective we wish to determine the patients who sought vaccination after immunoprophylaxis was indicated as a result of incorrect vaccination. RESEARCH DESIGN Cross section study to determine the incidence of effective vaccination and the number who sought vaccination. LOCATION Inicial visit patients. "Chopera I" Health Centre, Alcobendas (Madrid). PATIENTS Stratified sample of 385 patients representative of the population aged over 30 attending the Health Centre. For calculation of number who sought vaccination, 263 patients completed the study. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Vaccination coverage was 13.24% +/- 3.38% for alpha = 0.05, with statistically significant disfavouring difference in women and older age groups. 66.15% of the patients for whom immunoprophylaxis was indicated sought vaccination. CONCLUSIONS There is poor vaccination coverage in the over thirties population, especially in women. We note the high percentage of patients who sought vaccination without any risk factor at that time, indicating the fundamental role of the initial visit medical service in immunoprophylaxis.</dc:description>
