<dc:description xml:lang="en">We studied 15 patients with Parkinson's disease of 40 to 70 years of age; they had more than five years of evolution and of using levodopa. They had "on-off", "wearing-off" phenomena and dyskinesia. The duration of therapy suspension was seven days: they were evaluated daily in the seven days, and every month for six months. The Webster and the Hoehn and Yahr scales were used. Only two patients did not show significant improvement. Thirteen of fifteen patients showed a significant decrease in the Webster scale of up to 8 points. A p value of 0.005 was found at three months which was maintained until the sixth month with a p value of 0.0005; a decrease in this scale was present since the first month. There were no complications following therapy withdrawal. There was a decreased related to depression in most of them and also there was a levodopa dose decrease in seven of them.</dc:description>
