<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND During the last decade, the importance of glycemic control in the prevention of the microvascular complications of type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) was clearly demonstrated. AIM To evaluate the metabolic and anthropometric results of a multidisciplinary intensified treatment program of DMI in children and adolescents. PATIENTS AND METHODS Report of 54 patients treated during 2001. The intensified treatment consisted of: multiple daily doses of insulin, frequent glycemic control, nutritional, psychological and educational support, and permanent availability of a diabetes nurse for telephonic support. RESULTS Thirty one patients were female, their mean age was 10.4 +/- 0.5 years old and 52% were experiencing puberty. Fifty three percent of the patients used 3 insulin doses per day, 95% changed rapid insulin dose based on glucose levels and 18% considered carbohydrates in their rapid insulin dosing. Mean glycosilated hemoglobin was 8.18 +/- 0.23% without differences by sex or pubertal status. Sex, pubertal stage and the number of insulin doses did not contribute to glycosilated hemoglobin changes. There were no differences in weight or BMI, but there was a decrease in height Z score from the admission to the program until the last control (0.1 +/- 0.1 vs--0.3 +/- 0.1 DS; p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS A modified intensified modality of DM1 therapy for pediatric patients in a public hospital in Chile is feasible, achieving similar metabolic control, compared to international large centers.</dc:description>
