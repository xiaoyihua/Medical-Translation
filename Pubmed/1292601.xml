<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and its prognostic factors in a geriatric population living in a nursing home. Seventy-eight patients (68 females, 10 males) with a mean age of 82 +/- 6 years (range: 60-94) were studied. Once symptomatic infection is ruled out and the risk factors had been analyzed, a urine culture was performed in all cases. We then identified two different population groups: asymptomatic bacteriuria without risk factors (group A), and asymptomatic bacteriuria with risk factors (group B). Overall prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria was 38.5% (Group A: 23%, group B: 63%; p &lt; 0.001). Considering all patients with bacteriuria, 50% of cases (15 out of 30 patients) had urine incontinence, 40% suffer from severe limitation of movements and 70% had a past history of pregnancy. The same figures for the population with negative urine culture were 12.5%, 14.5%, and 46% respectively (p &lt; 0.01). In group B, 79% of cases had more than one RF, including all patients with the association of urine incontinence, movement limitation and diabetes. In group A, 93% of asymptomatic bacteriuria were due to E. coli with low adhesin expression (27%) whereas in group B, E. coli was isolated in 44% asymptomatic bacteriuria cases, with high adhesin expression (71.5%), other enteric gram-negative bacilli (31%), non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli (19%) and gram-positive cocci (6%). Group A patients were treated with a single dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) with elimination of bacteria in urine in 91% of cases (at one week) and 73% of cases (at one month).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
