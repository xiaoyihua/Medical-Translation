<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic surgery is following a natural course as it decreases surgical aggression on the abdominal wall without undermining the curative and functional results. Although it is still being developed, single port surgery has meant an advance in this sense. MATERIAL AND METHODS We present the first single port laparoscopic pyelolithectomy surgery in horseshoe kidney, using conventional rigid instruments. The case of an 18-year old patient with BMI of 19 in whom the imaging tests (urogram and computed tomography) showed a horseshoe kidney with left coralliform lithiasis and discrete calyceal ectasia is presented. The lithiasis was extracted using umbilical access with single port device and conventional rigid instruments. RESULTS The surgery was performed without complications. Surgery time was 110 minutes and bleeding 50 cc. On incision of the urinary system, there was purulent urine extravasation that conditioned fever of 38 °C in the post-operatory period. During the intervention, a double J stent was placed via percutaneous approach. The patient was discharged on the third day of hospitalization. CONCLUSION Single port laparoscopic access for pyelolithectomy surgery in horseshoe kidney is a reasonable alterative. The use of conventional rigid instruments facilitates the performance of this surgery with good triangulation, without conflict regarding hands and safety for the patient.</dc:description>
