<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) causes progressive cholesteryl ester and triglyceride accumulation in the lysosomes of hepatocytes and monocyte-macrophage system cells, resulting in a systemic disease with various manifestations that may go unnoticed. It is indispensable to recognize the deficiency, which can present in patients at any age, so that specific treatment can be given. The aim of the present review was to offer a guide for physicians in understanding the fundamental diagnostic aspects of LAL-D, to successfully aid in its identification. METHODS The review was designed by a group of Mexican experts and is presented as an orienting algorithm for the pediatrician, internist, gastroenterologist, endocrinologist, geneticist, pathologist, radiologist, and other specialists that could come across this disease in their patients. An up-to-date review of the literature in relation to the clinical manifestations of LAL-D and its diagnosis was performed. The statements were formulated based on said review and were then voted upon. The structured quantitative method employed for reaching consensus was the nominal group technique. RESULTS A practical algorithm of the diagnostic process in LAL-D patients was proposed, based on clinical and laboratory data indicative of the disease and in accordance with the consensus established for each recommendation. CONCLUSION The algorithm provides a sequence of clinical actions from different studies for optimizing the diagnostic process of patients suspected of having LAL-D.</dc:description>
