<dc:description xml:lang="en">Eleven cases of poisoning of children who had chewed threads from the barks of trees subsequently identified as Robinia pseudo-acacia were detected in Sanlúcar La Mayor (Sevilla). A retrospective study was carried out of all children who had chewed barks of these trees on the days 28, 29 and 30 of January. The data were collected from the daily record of emergencies. From the twenty fulfilled epidemiological questionnaires it was found out that the predominant symptoms were abdominal pain, nausea, "biliary" vomits and some degree of weakness. This fact points to the need to identify and to control the risk factors in a given milieu so as to prevent these occurrences.</dc:description>
