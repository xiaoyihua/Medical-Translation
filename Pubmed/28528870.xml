<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis is a rare aseptic bone inflammation that affects pediatric patients. Its management and treatment have not yet been standardized. METHODS Retrospective, descriptive study of patients under 14 years of age diagnosed with chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNBO) in a tertiary hospital. We included patients diagnosed over the last 6 years (2010-2015) who met the Jansson criteria. The clinical and radiological characteristics of CNBO were analyzed, as was the outcome after different therapeutic options. RESULTS We report 12 patients, with a mean age of 11 years (±1.6 standard deviation [SD]) and female predominance (10:2). The mean number of foci was 3.5 (±2.2 SD). The most common locations were ankle (58%), clavicle (50%), sternum (33%) and hip (25%). The mean disease duration was 10.5 months (±10.3 SD), and the median time to diagnosis was 2.38 months (range 0.17-16). Bone scintigraphy detected asymptomatic foci in 33% and we detected lytic lesions in 50% through magnetic resonance imaging. Biopsy was performed in 60%; 2/12 (16%) were associated with inflammatory disease and 1/12 (8.3%) later developed lymphoma. In all, 58% received antibiotic therapy with little response, 100% anti-inflammatory agents, 50% systemic corticosteroids, 41.6% methotrexate/pamidronate and 16% anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α. The mean duration of treatment was 14.8 months (±12.4 SD) and 66% had recurrences. Currently, 83% are in clinical remission without treatment. CONCLUSIONS When CNBO is refractory to treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, intravenous pamidronate can be an alternative. Anti-TNF drugs can be considered in patients who fail with pamidronate, as can agents associated with other autoimmune conditions.</dc:description>
