<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND There is consensus in promoting the selective use of glucocorticoids (GC) in the peri-operative period of transsphenoidal surgery (TE) for pituitary adenomas (PA). AIM To evaluate the safety of a selective glucocorticoid administration protocol and the usefulness of immediate postoperative cortisol levels as a predictor of final eucortisolism. PATIENTS AND METHODS Clinical and biochemical data from 40 patients aged 27 to 78 years (65% males) were prospectively collected. Exclusion criteria were previous use of GC, apoplexy and Cushing disease. Patients with pre-operative short synthetic ACTH test (SST) &gt; 18 µg/dl or basal cortisol &gt; 15 µg/dl did not receive GC. A morning serum cortisol (SC) threshold of 10 µg/dl in postoperative days one to three was used to decide a discharge without GC. Hypotension, dizziness or nausea, requirement of increased dose of corticosteroids, hospitalizations and emergency service visits were investigated, as well as surgical and endocrinological complications. Corticotropic status was evaluated three months after surgery. RESULTS Macroadenomas were present in 87% of patients. Median hospital stay was 4 days and follow up lasted 9 months. No differences were found in gender, age or tumor size between patients who received or not GC (35 and 65% respectively). Eighty five percent of patients were discharged without GC and all of them had normal corticotropic function three months after surgery. A SC ≥ 15 µg/dl had 100% specificity to predict eucortisolism. CONCLUSIONS Selective glucocorticoid administration is safe. A normal corticotropic function before surgery and in the immediate postoperative period are useful to identify patients who do not need GC.</dc:description>
