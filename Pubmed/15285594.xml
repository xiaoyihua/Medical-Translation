<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) is the most frequent pulmonary mass in childhood. It is histologically benign but locally aggressive. Atelectasis and recurrent airway infections are the most frequent presenting findings. We present two children in whom first clinical signs were paraneoplasic syndromes. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective study of two cases of IPT treated in our clinic from 1998 to 2002. Age, clinical presentation, preoperative diagnosis, treatment, histological diagnosis and postoperative outcome were reviewed from clinical chart. RESULTS Case 1: 7 year old male with incidental diagnosis of superior right lobe IPT in routine study because of diabetes. The mass collapsed superior and median lobar arteries and compressed superior cava vein. Right pneumonectomy was necesary to complete removal of the mass. From immediate postoperatory the child became normoglycemic and is free of insulin. Case 2: 11 year old male with rheumatologic clinic consisting in hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, arthralgy and knees liquid lasting for two years. X-ray examination showed mediastinic mass. He underwent complete removal of a pulmonary mass. Few months after the operation the rheumatologic-like symptoms were resolved. CONCLUSIONS IPT can present with paraneoplasic syndromes, although physiopathology is not well understood. In children with recurrent respiratory infections one diagnosis to take in mind is IPT, even more when clinic is associated with symptoms compatible with paraneoplasic syndrome.</dc:description>
