<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Clofazimine enterophathy is a serious complication of clofazimine when used at high doses for treatment of type 2 lepra or or erythema nodosum leprosum. Objective. A woman is presented who had a delayed diagnosis of leprosy, persistent type 2 lepra reaction and lethal clofazimine enteropathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 31-year-old woman presented leprosy symptoms over a 16-year period without medical diagnosis of her disease. During this period, type 2 lepra episodes occurred, but were not accurately diagnosed. These episodes became more severe during her second pregnancy. The patient and her family were interviewed, and her clinical history reviewed. RESULTS After twelve years of medical consults, lepromatous leprosy was diagnosed, based on perforation of her nasal septum, with a bacterial index of 5. Her husband and a 12-year-old daughter have leprosy symptoms. During multidrug therapy, she presented with repeated type 2 lepra reaction episodes for which she received daily clofazimine 400 mg doses. Two months after this treatment, severe and frequent episodes of intense abdominal pain began to occur. These persisted for more than a year and were managed with in-hospital administration of several classes of painkillers and antispasmodic medication, including morphine. She also presented with sporadic diarrhea, constipation, nausea, weight loss and mesenteric adenopathies. She died finally due to this intestinal condition. No autopsy was performed. CONCLUSIONS The patient's clinical presentation suggested a clofazimine-induced lethal enteropathy, a complication not previously seen in Colombia. This connection was not recognized by the medical officers that treated the patient.</dc:description>
