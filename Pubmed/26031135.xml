<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Pelvic tilt is clinically assessed based on its relationship with spinal conditions, but there is little evidence from the asymptomatic-population for comparison purposes. OBJECTIVE To analyze an asymptomatic population focusing,on pelvic asymmetries using photogrammetry. MATERIAL AND METHODS 92 subjects (18-35 years old) underwent marking of the anterior and posterior iliac spines and were photographed. Alcimage software was used to measure the pelvic tilt angle. Other tests included: the Kolmogorov normality test, t test, Wilcoxon test, and Pearson coefficient to measure the correlation. RESULTS 11.96% of males had anteversion and 34.78% normality; 38.04% of females had anteversion and 15.22% normality. Angles between iliacs for bilateral tilt showed no difference, but a difference was seen with the predominance of one side. For unilateral tilt a difference between illacs was seen. Good correlation of predominance versus anteversion was observed, and correlation was poor for side angles. The rest showed a weak or non-significant correlation. CONCLUSION Tilt cannot be used individually to characterize pelvic dysfunction or pathology.</dc:description>
