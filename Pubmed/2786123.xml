<dc:description xml:lang="en">In a cohort of 30 randomly selected hemophiliacs who were prospectively controlled for four years the predictive value of AIDS development was evaluated for serum markers of HIV infection and for lymphocytic subpopulations in peripheral blood. The patients were evaluated with a mean of 15.79 +/- 5.74 months, and overall antibodies, specific antibodies (anti-ENV and anti-p24), HIV antigen (Ag HIV) and lymphocyte subpopulations were determined. 50% of the hemophiliacs with positive serum Ag HIV (2/4) developed AIDS during the study, whereas this progression was not recorded in any anti-HIV positive, nonantigenic patient. The presence of Ag-HIV was detected at least two years before the diagnosis in these patients, and it was associated with the absence of anti-p24 in one or more determinations. The immune regulation parameters were not significantly different, at the beginning of the study, in the hemophiliacs who developed AIDS and in those who did not. However, the progression to AIDS was associated with a significantly smaller T4/T8 ratio at least one year before the diagnosis. Our results show that the development of AIDS in hemophiliacs is associated both with the presence of Ag-HIV in the serum and a reduction in the T4/T8 ratio, although the detection of the former appears to be earlier than that of the latter in this risk group.</dc:description>
