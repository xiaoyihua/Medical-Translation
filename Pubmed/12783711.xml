<dc:description xml:lang="en">The similarities in the vascularization of the retina and the kidney give rise to the complications of diabetes mellitus in the small vessels (microangiopathy) that appear in both organs. The present study presents the prospectively obtained results along 10 years in 104 diabetic type 1 patients, with the characteristics not to present microalbuminuria nor diabetic retinopathy at the beginning of the study; the results bear as objective the establishment of the relation between the presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and microalbuminuria, taking into account different factors of epidemiological risk: gender, duration of diabetes, presence of diastolic hypertension, levels of HbAlc, and blood lipids. The results obtained indicate a 10 years of follow-up incidence of diabetic retinopathy of 37.50% (being the proliferative form 13.46%) and the incidence of microalbuminuria is of 20.19%. The appearance of proliferative diabetic retinopathy is associated to the presence of diastolic hypertension, while the appearance of microalbuminuria is related to the elevation of levels of HbAlc. The results obtained in the proliferative diabetic retinopathy and microalbuminuria incidence are similar to those of other authors. At the end of the study four groups of patients are configured depending on whether they present proliferative diabetic retinopathy and/or microalbuminuria. The results obtained in the present study suggest the possible existence of two populations of diabetic patients, one that would develop proliferative diabetic retinopathy and renal injury, and a second population in which only would appear proliferative diabetic retinopathy.</dc:description>
