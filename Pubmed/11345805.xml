<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES [corrected] To demonstrate that Burch colposuspension gives a higher index of fails in over sixty years women affected of stress incontinence than in women under sixty years of age. METHODS We established two groups of follow-up, each of them included twenty women affected of stress urine incontinence and surgical treatment indication. The only difference between both groups was the age of the patients, with a limit established in sixty years. We have evaluated the results of surgical intervention one year after it. The binomial parameters are compared with x2 test; the continuous parameters with the t-Student test for independent parameters. RESULTS We did not find statistical significative differences with number of deliveries, body mass index, previous pelvic surgery, perineal rehabilitation, or the importance of the incontinence, between both groups of women. We found statistical significative difference in the novo micturition urgency or an increase in a previous urgency (p &lt; 0.1) in women over sixty years. We did not find statistical significative differences in the number of successes and fails in both groups. CONCLUSION The age is not a risk factor of failing of Burch colposuspension, but it is a risk factor of the appearance or increase of micturition urgency.</dc:description>
