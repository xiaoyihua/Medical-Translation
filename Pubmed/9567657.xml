<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cervical cancer represents a severe public health problem and has been associated to the presence of human papillomavirus. Strategies are presently being tested which target the virus to attempt to control disease progress. Studies on the humoral and cell-mediated immunity of the papillomavirus infection have been useful in the development of a vaccine. Synthetic virus-like particles have been validated as vaccine against several animal papillomaviruses and used to map the seroepidemiology of the human papillomavirus infection, and define neutralizing antibodies. Induction of cell-mediated immunity to HPV early proteins is bound to become a therapeutic approach to HPV infections. Recent advances have centered on directing the immune response to prevent infection, to virus-infected cells and to virally transformed cells, with favourable results.</dc:description>
