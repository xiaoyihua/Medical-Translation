<dc:description xml:lang="en">Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) is classified into the family of Retroviridae and preferentially causes a chronic infection of CD4+ T cells. Most people infected with HTLV-1 remain asymptomatic. However, less than 105 of infected individuals eventually develop any of the associated severe diseases such as inflammatory syndromes, neoplastic diseases and opportunistic infections including Strongyloides stercoralis and Sarcoptes scabiei hyperinfections. Recently, it has been described that a weak Th2 cell-mediated response is associated with HTLV-1 infection and Strongyloides hyperinfection. The evaluation for HTLV-1 in all Norwegian scabies and S. stercoralis hyperinfection cases is highly recommended, especially when no other risk factors are apparent, in order to start a specific therapy against these parasite-virus coinfections.</dc:description>
