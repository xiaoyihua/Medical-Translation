<dc:description xml:lang="en">The striking and apparent specific elevation of the activity of chitotriosidase found in plasma from patients with Gaucher disease (GD) Type 1 (Mc Kusick 230800) is considered a new diagnostic hallmark of GD and should prove useful in assessing clinical manifestations and monitoring enzyme supplementation therapy. Further data have suggested that the increased levels of chitotriosidade activity in plasma from patients with unexplained diseases may be indicative of a lysosomal storage disorder. We present here an experience of the plasmatic chitotriosidase in an Argentinean population consisting of three groups: a) 25 healthy controls; b) subjects related with GD: 3 patients Type 1, 3 obligated heterocygotes and 1 patient with an atypical variant of GD; c) 42 patients with a precise nosologycal definition of inherited error of metabolism (IEM) and 5 patients presumably affected by a lysosomal pathology but without enzymatic confirmation. Methylumbellypheryl-tri-N-acetyl chitotrioside hydrolase activity was markedly increased: the mean activity being &gt; 600 times and &gt; 100 times the mean value in plasma of our healthy control (mean 17 nmol/min/ml, range 6-60.4 nmol/min/ml) in the plasma of the patients of Gaucher Type 1 disease and an atypical variant of GD, respectively. In the two more affected patients the elevated levels of chitotriosidase activity ran parallel to the severity of the disease and also as a response to the supplementation enzymatic therapy with a decrease of 50% of its activity at 10 months of therapy at a dose of 30 u/kg/month. Moreover, no increase of chitotriosidase activity was found in the 3 obligated heterozygotes of Gaucher Type 1 and Type 2 disease or in any other of the IEM. Chitotriosidase activity was absent in plasma of 2 control subjects and in 4 patients with exact diagnosis of an IEM. The physiological role of the human chitinase still has to be established and warrants further investigation and the natural consequence of the high frequency of a genetic deficiency in man. Meanwhile, reports on the purification and characterization of human chitotriosidase with chitinolytic activity toward chitin-containing pathogens and on the cloning of cDNA encoding chitinase will be crucial to obtain a better insight into this new chapter of medical genetics.</dc:description>
