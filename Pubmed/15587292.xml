<dc:description xml:lang="en">Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main aethiological factor in the development of squamous cervical neoplasia. Nowadays molecular hybridization is the most adequated method to detect HPV. Study is based on the HPV assay by means of mixed hybridization and capture of specific sequences of viral DNA. Detection of HPV by hybridization and capture is a very useful technique in patients with non-definitive cytologies of viral action, but that display high clinical suspect for such a infection. The cervical cancer screening increases its sensibility and specificity by a combined study of cytology and hibridization. The highest benefit is for those cases classified initially as ASCUS, in which the HPV results point out a more accurate diagnosis and guide subsequent adequate therapy. The results show that for normal cytology up to 87.1% was negative for virus, in the ASCUS group a 56.76% was positive for HPV, in the 32 LSIL cases a 43.8% was negative for HPV, while only a 33% of the HSIL II was negative, finally there were no negative cases for HSIL III, finding an 11.1% for low risk and low plus high risk, and a 77.8% for high risk alone. In spite of the clear relationship between cytology and HPV determination, one must be careful in establishing the treatment for the cases that displayed high risk HPV with cytology within normal limits or ASCUS. We consider these patients as high risk ones thus being suitable for a more strict follow up, keeping more aggressive procedures for the cases with cytologic manifestations.</dc:description>
