<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Dysraphias are a varied set of anomalies affecting neuroectodermic tissue caused by the alteration of the neural tube during embryogenesis. Neuroradiological classification is broad and clinical manifestations are numerous: they affect the skin, osteomuscular tissue and the vascular, urological and nervous systems. We describe the case of a young adult with infrequent spinal dysraphism, which appeared as recurrent meningitis, and we stress the importance of studies using neuroimaging to define dysraphias. CASE REPORT Male aged 23 with a history of urinary sphincter dysfunction, spina bifida and meningitis in infancy. He was admitted for treatment for recurrent meningitis and neuroradiological exploration revealed a hidden spinal dysraphism associated with spina bifida, sacrococcygeal dermal sinus with a fistular duct and communication with the dural sac, epidural lipoma and anchored spinal cord. The patient was submitted to decompression laminectomy, the abovementioned sinus was cut and the lipoma was removed. CONCLUSIONS When faced with a case of recurrent meningitis, one of the etiopathogenic mechanisms to be taken into account is the presence of different malformations that can act as a point of entry to the nervous system not only in the cranial area but also, as in our case, in the spinal region. Late diagnosis of the cases is infrequent, but the presence of spina bifida with skin and urological manifestations point to possible malformations of the neural tube. Early surgical treatment must be performed in order to prevent neurological complications, which are potentially serious and give rise to high morbidity and mortality rates.</dc:description>
