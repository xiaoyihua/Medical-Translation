<dc:description xml:lang="en">The province of Misiones reported 205 leishmaniasis cases during 1998, 98% of them from the locality of Puerto Esperanza. The reports of Puerto Esperanza Hospital (January to September 1998) for leishmaniasis were analysed (n: 129). The mainly reported lesion was the single cutaneous ulcer (97.2%), localized in the inferior limbs (72.5%), without any mucosa involvement. The results are consistent with the knowledge from other Argentinean leishmaniasis foci due to Leishmania (V.) braziliensis. The difference in incidence among sexes was not significant, leishmaniasis was reported in all age groups, and it was susceptible to the conventional treatment. The main focus was located in Km 1 neighbourhood, the transmission peak was during April 1998. The Montenegro skin test among general population (n: 205) did not show reactivity among asymptomatic people. The prevalent Phlebotominae species were Lutzomyia intermedia (79.7%) and Lu. whitmani (10.9%), among the 577 individuals belonging to 8 species collected. The Phlebotominae were abundant in peridomestic habitats of Km 1 neighbourhood, close to human dwellings, in places associated with residual primary forest and secondary vegetation. The results are discussed in the frame of surveillance and possible control strategies.</dc:description>
