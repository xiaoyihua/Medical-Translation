<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a Nutritional Support Team (NST) in the control and follow-up of enteral nutrition (EN) in patients subjected to laryngectomy as a result of neoplasia. The study was performed on two groups of patients (A and B) who had been admitted into the Otorhinolaryngological Department, and who required EN by nasogastric tube during the postoperative period. Group A consisted of 20 patients in whom EN was based on standard guidelines, with a daily intake of 11.1 g of Nitrogen and 2.000 kcals. Group B included 23 patients who received EN individually, using NST with a daily intake of Nitrogen of between 8 and 21 g, and energy intake of between 2.000 and 3.000 kcals. The total cost of nutrition was calculated using the following partial costs: diet, administration, laboratory analysis and NST head responsible for follow-up of Group B. Individualized EN was more effective in nutritional terms than a standard diet in all patients. Using this form of treatment, positive Nitrogen balance were achieved, levels of seric albumin were maintained as well as weight, and complications were reduced. The average cost of nutrition per patient in Group B was 46.258 pesetas and in Group A, 43.963 pesetas. However, in the latter Group, there was an average additional weight loss of 4 kg per patient, and an increase in cost effectiveness ratio of 573 pesetas in weight gained in Group B compared to Group A.</dc:description>
