<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To evaluate a self-measuring blood pressure (BP) monitor, the OMRON-HM 722C. DESIGN Based on the protocol of the British Hypertension Society (BHS). SETTING Urban health centre. PARTICIPANTS A sample of 120 people (69 women) excluded those with a brachial perimeter under 24 centimetres or over 32. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Each subject had four BP measurements in succession, separated by a minute: a) Manually, with a mercury sphygmomanometer (MSM); b) with self-measurement monitor; c) with self-measurement monitor; d) with MSM. Means and SD of systolic and diastolic pressures, means and SD of the differences and a graphic representation of these by the Bland and Altman method, were calculated. The cumulative percentages of differences the same as or below 5, 10 and 15 mm Hg were calculated. 89.1% of systolic BPs, and 92.5% of diastolic BPs, showed mean differences between monitor and observer equal to or below 5 mm Hg. The size of the differences was grade A in both cases, according to the BHS criteria. CONCLUSION The OMRON-HM 722C self-measuring monitor could be useful for self-measurement of BP at home by primary care patients.</dc:description>
