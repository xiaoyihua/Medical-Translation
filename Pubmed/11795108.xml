<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper presents the results of a prospective study aimed at identifying financial requirements to provide and finance healthcare services during the period 2001-2003, for high blood pressure and diabetes, the two main chronic diseases demanding healthcare services in Mexico. The study population was drawn from Mexico's three main healthcare institutions: The Ministry of Health (SSA); the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS); and the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers (ISSSTE). The costing method was based on instrumentation and consensus techniques per average case management. Six Box-Jenkins probabilistic models were constructed to estimate the epidemiologic change for the period 2001-2003. Study findings suggest that if risk factors and healthcare provision models remain unchanged, the financial consequences would have a greater impact on the Ministry of Health, followed by IMSS and ISSSTE. Financial requirements for both diseases will account for nearly 2% of the total budget allocated to the uninsured, and 3.5% for the insured population. Indirect costs showed a similar trend in the three institutions, representing nearly 23% above total direct costs.</dc:description>
