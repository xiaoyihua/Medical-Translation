<dc:description xml:lang="en">Although radioiodine (131-I) can be used as treatment of hyperthyroidism for patients in hemodialysis, its use is limited and the experience is mainly related to differentiated thyroid carcinoma. We report a 58 years old female on hemodialysis with recurrent hyperthyroidism after propylthiouracil treatment. She was successfully treated with 131-I and four months after the intervention her euthyroid state was confirmed. We measured 131-I activity in blood, dialysate liquid and other waste products, as well as patient radiation exposure rates. We found that 131-I elimination was prolonged through time with no major dependence on hemodialysis, as opposed to the elimination of 131-I in patients with thyroid carcinoma. This was probably due to high radiotracer uptake in hyper functioning thyroid tissue. Conversely, radiation content in dialysate wastes or equipment was minimal. Furthermore, the rate of both environmental exposure and exposure of nursing staff in charge of hemodialysis sessions, was minimal and met international security standards. In conclusion, I-131 therapy showed both appropriate effectiveness and safety in this case and may be considered as a suitable treatment alternative to thyroidectomy when antithyroid drugs are unsuccessful.</dc:description>
