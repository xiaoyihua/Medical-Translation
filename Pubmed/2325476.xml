<dc:description xml:lang="en">The prevalence of infection by hepatitis B (HBV) and delta (HDV) viruses and presumably related variables were evaluated in a prison for young male convicts, aged 16-21 years (n = 686), 55.1% of convicts were positive for one or more VHB markers, and 7.1% were positive for HBsAg; 89.7% of these were negative for IgM anti-HBc (chronic carriers), while 36.6% were positive for HBeAg. Anti-delta antibodies were detected in 37.5% of chronic carriers. The seropositivity of HVB markers was much higher in parenteral drug abusers (PDA) as compared with non PDA (76.3% vs 26.7%, p less than 0.0000001, OR = 8.82). Among PDA, it was higher in regular users than in occasional ones (83.3% vs 62.9%, p = 0.0001, OR = 2.95) and in those who had acquired the habit at an early age (p = 0.035). The stratified analysis also showed an association of VHB infection with other variables, basically ethical and prison-related. The possibility to develop active immunization programs is evaluated.</dc:description>
