<dc:description xml:lang="en">The introduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) beta blockers has make it possible to obtain a significant advance in the control and knowledge of some inflammatory diseases, among them psoriasis. TNF is a cytokine that plays a key role in the control of infections and neoplasms. The increase of the risk of developing a neoplasm during the use of this group of drugs is one of the more debated adverse effects in the literature. We present the clinical case of one patient with long-course psoriasis who developed a breast adenocarcinoma after initiating treatment with etanercept. In this article, we provide a brief review on the possible associations existing between the use of anti-TNF therapy and the risk of the appearance of come neoplasms, among which leukemias, lymphomas and some solid tumors stand out.</dc:description>
