<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION SBS is the main cause of intestinal failure (IF) in children and has a high morbility and mortality. OBJECTIVES to analyze factors associated with the outcome and survival of SBS children. METHODS analytical, descriptive and retrospective study. We include patients with residual bowel length (RBL) ≤ 40 cm. OUTCOME is analyzed in groups: dead (D), adapted (A), parenteral nutrition dependant (NPD), and transplanted (Tx) according to: bowel anatomy, diagnosis, prematurely, year of beginning of IF, duration of IF, cholestasis (CB &gt; 2 mg/dl) and thrombosis. Survival is analyzed with Kaplan Meier. RESULTS 63 patients were included: RBL x 21 ± 11 cm, preserved colon 46%, prematures 41%, neonatal resection 78%, duration of IF x 0.66 years. 54% had cholestasis (CB x 5.29 ± 2.35 mg/dl) and 25% had thrombosis. OUTCOME D 33%, A 27%, PND 30% and Tx 10%. Adapted patients had longer RBL (p 0.001) and more preserved colon (p 0.017). 1 year survival was 86%, 2 years 70% and 3 years 66%. Age at death: x 2.3 years. Causes of death: hepatic failure 62%, lack of venous access 19%, sepsis 10%, others 10%. Factors related to death were shorter RBL (p 0.045), cholestasis (0.049, admittance to the center before 2000 (p 0.02). CONCLUSIONS SBS had a high mortality and 1/3 of patients could adapt requiring up to 5 years. Adaptation was in relation to anatomic factors. Mortality was related to.</dc:description>
