<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Several genetic polymorphisms of adiponectin have been associated to metabolic diseases as obesity and co-morbidities. AIM To investigate if there are associations between +45TG, +276GT, -11,377CG y -11,391GA adiponectin SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) with obesity in a Chilean children population. MATERIAL AND METHODS A case-control study was performed in 241 obese and 126 normal weight children (7-11 years old) from the urban community of Hualpén, Biobío region. Children were classified as normal or obese, according to age and gender-specificpercentiles defined by Centerfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The analysis of serum markers was carried out using commercial kits. Adiponectin polymorphisms were determined through a High Resolution Melting (HRM)-enabled real time PCR and by DNA fragment sequencing. RESULTS The observed allelic frequencies of the studied SNPs were over 11%. The 11,377CG polymorphism was associated with a high risk of obesity, calculated by the additive inheritance model (odds ratio = 1.389, 95% confidence interval: 1.001-1.929,p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS Obese school children of the Biobío Region, have an increased risk of carrying the susceptibility allele polymorphism 11377CG of adiponectin gene.</dc:description>
