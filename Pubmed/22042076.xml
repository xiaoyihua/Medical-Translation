<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Retrospective description of fungal infections in a specialized intensive care burn unit. RESULTS A total of 41 (21%) of 195 patients admitted from January 2002 to March 2006 developed fungal infections at any site. The median age of patients was 48 months (interquartile range: 18-84), and the affected burn surface was 40% (interquartile range 30 and 65% The median time lapse between admission and fungal infections was 13 days (interquartile range 8-20 d) The most frequent site of isolation was burnt wound in 38 patients (93%) and in blood cultures in 3 patients (7%). In 93% of patients bacterial infections were also found. The predominant fungus recovered was Candida spp in 20 patients (49%); followed by Aspergillus sp in 6 patients (15%), Anphotericin B was the drug of choice. The median time of complete treatment was 23 days (interquartile range: 15-30). One patient died (2%) from causes related to fungal infection. CONCLUSION A total of 41 (21%) of 195 patients admitted from January 2002 to March 2006 developed fungal infections. Candida sp was the most frequently found. Mortality was low.</dc:description>
