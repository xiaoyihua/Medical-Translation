<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Minimally invasive surgery (CMI) for the treatment of malignant tumors in children begins to have a role for selected cases and reaches similar results than open surgery. We show our first two cases of Wilms tumor treated by laparoscopy describing patients and technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three-year-old girl with macroscopic hematuria is diagnosed of 8 cm mass in the left kidney suggesting Wilms tumor. After 4 weeks of chemotherapy she went under laparoscopic nephroureterectomy. The histological result was Wilms tumor. Chemotherapy was completed seven more months. Five-year-old patient with abdominal pain is diagnosed of renal right mass suggesting Wilms tumor. After 4 weeks of chemotherapy the laparoscopic nephroureterectomy was performed. The histological result was Wilms tumor. Treatment was completes with postoperatory chemotherapy. RESULTS After 1 year follow-up both patients have clinical and radiological absence of disease. CONCLUSION The CMI in selected cases of Wilms tumor fulfills successfully the aims of the surgical treatment.</dc:description>
