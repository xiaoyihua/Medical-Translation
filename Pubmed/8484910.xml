<dc:description xml:lang="en">The main microbiological and physico-chemical parameters in dry-salted ham previously selected were determined along the elaboration process. All determinations were performed at 2 levels: surface and internal. All bacterial groups showed a similar behaviour, increasing along the first stages up to the third month of drying, then decreasing to numbers similar to the initial ones. Only the halotolerants maintained fairly high numbers during last stages. Some groups were almost absent at internal levels. The hazardous bacteria showed different behaviour: whereas the faecal streptococci were fairly abundant during the whole study, coliforms almost disappeared at the final stages. During the elaboration process at different stages of ripening they were analysed in order to know the moulds population at surface level. Aspergillus and Penicillium were the dominant genera. The latter, mainly represented by 10 species, dominated during the first stages of elaboration. Aspergillus was present throughout the whole making process. The glaucus group was clearly dominant at the final stages due to the low aw values together with the high NaCl percentages. Aspergillus halophilicus was the most abundant species identified (18%) and the most frequently isolated at the final stages.</dc:description>
