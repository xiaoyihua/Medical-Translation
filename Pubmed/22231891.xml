<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION In the year 2009, the World Health Organization declared the Influenza A H1N1 virus as a pandemic. It has been reported that the radiographic pattern in chest x-ray may predict the clinical outcome in patients affected. OBJECTIVE To describe the chest x-ray findings in pediatrics patients with confirmed diagnosis of Influenza H1N1 respiratory infection and its correlation with clinical evolution. POPULATION AND METHODS A retrospective, analytic and descriptive study of 47 pediatric inpatients with confirmed diagnosis of H1N1 influenza who had available chest x-ray was performed. Medical records were reviewed for underlying medical conditions and patient's outcome. RESULTS 94% of patients had abnormal x-ray. Consolidation and ground-glass opacities had significantly higher frequency in patients who needed more days of oxygen supplement. Initial chest x-ray with lobar consolidation was observed in patients with greater risk of Intensive care unit admission. CONCLUSION The most frequent radiological patterns found were ground-glass opacities and peribronchial markings. Lobar consolidation and ground-glass opacities are associated with adverse outcome.</dc:description>
