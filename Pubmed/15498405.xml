<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To describe variations in the management of nasosinus disorders among the Autonomous Communities and hospitals of Spain. METHODS We analyzed the Minimum Basic Data Set of the public health system from 1998-2000 for the diagnoses of nasosinus polyps and chronic sinusitis. We studied the distribution by regions of the rate of hospitalizations and of 4 indicators of quality of care and efficiency: mean length of stay, percentage of discharges without surgery, percentage of functional endoscopic sinus surgery and surgical complications. A cluster analysis was performed to classify hospitals according to the values of these indicators. RESULTS We analyzed 13061 discharges from 263 hospitals. Marked differences were found in age-adjusted hospitalization rates by regions. Cluster analysis classified the centers with more than 10 annual discharges in 3 categories: a) 32 hospitals in which the 4 quality indicators were above average; b) 35 hospitals in which 3 of the indicators were below average, and c) 74 hospitals in which 2 indicators were above average and 2 indicators were below average. CONCLUSIONS Marked interregional variations were found in hospitalization rates, as well as in the characteristics of management of nasosinus disorders in Spanish hospitals. The centers examined could be grouped into three clearly defined patterns according to indicators of quality of care and efficiency.</dc:description>
