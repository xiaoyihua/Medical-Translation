<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To determine the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in preoperative anesthetic assessment interviews during May 2004 and to compare the results to prevalences reported in other studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients over the age of 20 years who received an assessment interview were included. Type 1 diabetics, pregnant women, and critically ill patients were excluded. We followed the 1997 diagnostic guidelines of the American Diabetes Association. RESULTS The prevalence of previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes was 10.3%. Three patients were diabetics unaware of their disease. The overall prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 11% in this population. CONCLUSIONS Type 2 diabetes has a high prevalence among surgical patients in our hospital, higher than that reported for the general population based on other studies.</dc:description>
