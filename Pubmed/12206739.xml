<dc:description xml:lang="en">AIM To evaluate the role of isotopic studies in the diagnosis and follow-up of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and to present the results of our current protocol. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty three patients with VUR were retrospectively studied with a mean follow-up of 43 years (1-11 years). VUR was diagnosed by voiding cystourethrography and followed-up by direct radionuclide cystography. During the follow-up all patients were studied by means of renal DMSA scintigraphy (21 were also studied during the acute phase of febrile urinary tract infection). RESULTS Eighty three renal units were examined. Voiding cystourethrography was positive for VUR in 49 renal units (59%; 8 grade I, 18 grade II, 15 grade III, and 8 grade IV). During the follow-up, direct radionuclide cystography showed decrease or disappearance of VUR in 29 renal units (35%; 4 grade I, 16 grade II, 7 grade III, and 2 grade IV). DMSA studies performed during the follow-up showed cortical lesions in 17 renal units (5 with VUR grade II, 7 with grade III, and 5 grade IV). Nine of 21 patients examined by DMSA during the acute phase of febrile urinary tract infection showed cortical damage (43%), and 6 of them (67%) progressed to cortical lesion in the follow-up DMSA. CONCLUSIONS The present protocol allows for the correct diagnosis and control of VUR, the early detection of acute renal damage, and the control of its evolution.</dc:description>
