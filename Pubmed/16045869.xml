<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Tobacco smoking during pregnancy is an important risk factor in the pediatric population and has been associated with an increase in low birth weight (LBW) infants. PATIENTS AND METHODS We carried out a retrospective case-control study of infants admitted to the Infants Department of the Hospital Universitario Infantil Niño Jesús in Madrid. Data from 2370 infants admitted to the hospital between 2002 and 2004 were collected. RESULTS The odds ratio (OR) for having a LBW infant was 1.42 (95 % CI: 1.017-1.985) among mothers who smoked during pregnancy and was 1.37 (95 % CI: 1.014-1.863) among women whose partners smoked. Gestational age was also a predictive factor of birth weight: the OR was 0.585 (95 % CI: 0.545-0.628). No significant differences for risk of LBW were found between sexes (OR: 1.25; 95 % CI: 0.934-1.671). CONCLUSIONS Our results should reinforce the importance of smoking prevention during and after pregnancy in both parents, which could reduce many complications in children's health with a high medical, social and economic cost.</dc:description>
