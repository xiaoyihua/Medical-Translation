<dc:title xml:lang="en">Study of body composition and metabolism and retinol binding protein in human immunodeficiency virus subjects from São Paulo, Brazil</dc:title>
<dc:description xml:lang="en">Objective: To evaluate body composition, metabolism and RBP, RBP4 and retinol values in HIV-patients. Methods: Males aged between 19 and 60 were divided into two groups: infected by HIV (HIV +, n = 20) and not infected by HIV (n = 20). All subjects were submitted to X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess body composition and blood samples were collected to measured retinol, RBP, RBP-4, glucose, triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Results: The HIV + group showed significant lower fat mass on leg (18,5 ± 7%) than control (respectively 26 ± 6,7 %). It was observed lower levels of HDL in HIV+ group (29 ± 5 mg/dL), and higher levels of TG (282 ± 176) than in control group (respectively 33 ±3mg/dL, 144 ± 43 mg / dl). The ratio of TG to HDL, considered as insulin resistance parameter was higher in HIV+ group (10 ± 9) than control (4 ± 1). Neither statistical significant result was found for retinol, RBP and RBP-4. Conclusion: HIV patients had metabolic and body composition changes, confirming lipodystrophy syndrome, but there was no difference for retinol, RBP and RBP-4 compared to control group (AU)</dc:description>
