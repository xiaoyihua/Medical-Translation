<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the presence and consultations with nurse terminology in the Spanish edition of Wikipedia, and to analyze the differences with the English edition. METHOD We confirmed the existence of terminology via the Internet by the access to the Spanish and English editions of Wikipedia. RESULTS We calculated the study sample (n = 386) from the 1840 nursery terms. 337 were found in the Spanish edition and 350 in the English. We found significant differences between the two editions (p &lt; 0.001). Also differences were winched on to the number of references in terms (p &lt; 0.001). However, there were not differences in the update/obsolescence of information, neither in the number of queries. CONCLUSIONS The entries (articles) on nursing terminology in the Spanish edition of Wikipedia, has not yet reached an optimum level. Differences between Spanish and English editions of Wikipedia are more related to term existence than adequacy of information.</dc:description>
