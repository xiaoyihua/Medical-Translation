<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery program is an educational program developed by the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons, which includes a handson skills training component, a cognitive component, and an assessment component for laparoscopic surgery. Its main objective is to provide surgical residents and practicing surgeons with the opportunity to learn fundamental skills and obtain the theoretical knowledge required to perform laparoscopic surgery, guaranteeing a better performance in the operating room, and thus, improving patient security. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of telesimulation for teaching the Fundamentals of Laparosopic Surgery program in Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty participants (ten general surgeons and ten general surgery residents) in two cities in Colombia participated in eight weekly telesimulation sessions. Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery scores were obtained for each participant before the telesimulation sessions (pre-test scores) and after telesimulation training was completed (post-test scores). RESULTS Using scoring parameters developed by the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons, we found a significant improvement between pre-test and post-test scores. All the participants passed the skills component of the course. CONCLUSION This study evidences the effectiveness of telesimulation to improve the laparoscopic skills of the participants who had no previous knowledge of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery program, which guaranteed obtaining the necessary score for approving the practical component of the program.</dc:description>
