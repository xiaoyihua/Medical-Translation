<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to estimate and analyze the evolution of mortality rates due to suicide in Peru between 2004 and 2013. National death records from the Peruvian Ministry of Health were analyzed, calculating the regional mortality rates due to suicide standardized by age. Similarly, rates grouped in 5-year periods were geospatially projected. There were 3,162 cases of suicide (67.2% men); the age range with the highest incidence was 20 to 29 years (28.7%) and 49.2% were due to poisoning. Suicide rates increased from 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38-0.55) to 1.13 (95% CI = 1.01-1.25) per 100,000 people from 2004 to 2013, respectively. The highest rates of suicide were identified in Pasco, Junín, Tacna, Moquegua, and Huánuco. The suicide issue in Peru requires a comprehensive approach that entails not just identifying the areas with the highest risk, but also studying its associated factors that may explain the regional variability observed.</dc:description>
