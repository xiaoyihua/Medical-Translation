<dc:description xml:lang="en">This article reports on the prevalence of genital herpes infection in a sample of 635 female university students who were seen at the Gynecology Center of the University of Chile Student Medical Service. Viral isolation of genital secretions yielded 18 students (2.8%) with positive results, of whom 28% were asymptomatic shedders. Of the positive cases, 61% were clinically classified as recurrent and 39% as first episodes of genital herpes. Fluorescent monoclonal antibody typing of the isolated strains revealed that 72% were herpes simplex type 2 and 28% were type 1. The results confirm the importance of type 2 virus in genital herpes infections. They also point to asymptomatic shedders as a potential source of infection, and show the importance of a history of genital herpes in the identification of this population.</dc:description>
