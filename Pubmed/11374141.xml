<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to report on the occurrence of conventional and emerging viral agents as well as their etiological link with diarrhea in kidney transplanted subjects from Cordoba, Argentina. A total of 42 stool samples were analysed. They were obtained from both ambulatory and hospitalized kidney transplanted patients with and without diarrhea after transplant. All patients were under immunosuppressive treatment with steroids, azatioprine and cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Results revealed the presence of group A rotavirus and picobimavirus in three patients suffering from severe diarrhea (33.33%). No enteric bacterial agent was isolated from these patients. The presence of viral agents was related to high levels of cyclosporine in blood (&gt; 290 ng/ml) or prolonged immunosuppressive treatment. On the other hand, no virus was detected in any of the samples collected from asymptomatic individuals (p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that viruses are implicated in the etiology of diarrheal disease in these patients.</dc:description>
