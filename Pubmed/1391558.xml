<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to evaluate the situation of tetanus in Guipúzcoa and to assess the impact of preventive measures, we studied the incidence, mortality and other aspects of the disease during the past three decades. Ninety eight cases were detected (annual average 3,27 SD 2,6), this figure being reduced over time (7,2 cases per year during the period 1962-1966; 1,8 cases per year between 1987 and 1991). 67,3% were men and 32,7% women. We registered 6 cases of neonatal tetanus, all of them prior to 1976. Since 1969, there has been no cases within the 1-14 age group. Half of the cases detected during the last five years (4/9) were intravenously drug-addicts. Among those living in less populated areas (less than 10.000 population), the risk of developing the disease was four times greater. 33,7% of patients died, being the mortality rate higher among newborns and patients died, and patients over 55. Although the situation was not worse than in other similar environments, the incidence of tetanus should be reduced by reinforcing preventive measures.</dc:description>
