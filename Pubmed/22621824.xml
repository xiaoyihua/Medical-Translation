<dc:description xml:lang="en">Clinical research on human beings is essential for progress in medicine; however, it is also essential to safeguard research subjects' autonomy, dignity, and rights. Diverse documents have been developed in consensus to address these issues: some of the most relevant are the Nuremberg Code, the Helsinki Declaration, and the Oviedo Convention. In addition to being familiar with these fundamental documents, all radiologists who conduct research should know about Ethics Committees and consult them about the methodology of their studies, which must fulfill the conditions stipulated in the above-mentioned guidelines as well as in the legislation in force.</dc:description>
