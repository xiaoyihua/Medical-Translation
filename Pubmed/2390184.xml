<dc:description xml:lang="en">Numerous investigators have suspected that there is a genetic predisposition to rheumatic fever (RF). In this context a group of investigators at Rockefeller University have produced a monoclonal antibody that identifies an antigen present in 100% of all RF studied at that center. Using this antibody, labeled D8/17, we studied 47 patients with acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. Of these, 39 were not receiving steroids at the of the test and 35 were positive for the marker (89.7%). The highest percentage of positive cells was seen in the probands with 34.6 +/- 13.16%, while unaffected mothers, fathers and siblings gave 24.9, 5.2 and 7.3% respectively. The control group had an average of 7.5% of positive cells. This study and previous ones, performed by the Rockefeller University group in which HLA typing was included, suggest an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, not associated with the MHC system, for the D8/17 antigen.
