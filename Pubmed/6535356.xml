<dc:description xml:lang="en">Four cases of megaesophagus with esophageal motor disturbances secondary to adenocarcinoma of the cardia are hereby reported. There were common characteristics to all cases such as: 1) short duration of symptoms, 2) grade II megaesophagus by X-Rays with narrowing of the cardia, 3) the endoscopy showed esophageal dilatation and inability to pass the cardia with the endoscope, 4) histology (obtained by endoscopy or surgery) and exfoliative cytology were positive for malignancy, 5) the esophageal motility tests showed aperistalsis of the whole esophagus in all cases, and lack of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter in two. The urecholine test was positive in one patient with neoplastic infiltration of the myenteric plexus, 6) in two cases where esophageal resection was performed, infiltration of the Auerbach's plexus by cancer cells was proven. We conclude that in the presence of aperistalsis of the esophagus with or without achalasia of the lower esophageal sphincter, the diagnosis of megaesophagus secondary to cancer of the gastric fundus should be suspected when it is not possible to pass the cardia with the endoscope, even if biopsy and cytology are negative for malignancy.</dc:description>
