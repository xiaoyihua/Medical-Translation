<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Various articles describe the existence of differences in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality between different Spanish Autonomous Communities (SACs). We have intended to know if there are coherent differences in hypertensive patients cardiovascular risk. MATERIAL AND METHODS 1,720 family physicians distributed in the 17 SACs as the number of inhabitants of each one selected 5 consecutive patients maximum within a period of 2 months, with blood pressure &gt; or = 140/90 mmHg and at least another coronary risk factor. In 6,775 of 7,469 patients (51% males), the risk of a coronary event (CE) in the next 10 years according to Framingham equation and the risk of fatal cardiovascular event (RCV) according to Score formula were calculated. RESULTS CE calculated in the group of patients in primary prevention (and without diabetes) in northern SACs (Cantábrico) was 18.8%, and 20.5% in south-east SACs (Mediterranean) (p &lt; 0.0001). In addition, CE in secondary prevention was 26.1% in northern SACs and 28.6% in south-east SACs (p &lt; 0.0001). The differences remained upon considering diabetics in primary prevention. There were no significant differences, however, in the risk of cardiovascular death (Score) between both areas, being 8.9% in the north and 8.8% in the south-east. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that coronary risk is increased in hypertensive populations of south east SACs with respect to SACs of the north and to national average, while the risk of suffering a fatal cardiovascular event is not different.</dc:description>
