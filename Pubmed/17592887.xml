<dc:description xml:lang="en">Fungi have showed a great potential for the biological control of nematodes. However, they have not been evaluated for the control of animal and/or human parasites transmitted by egg contaminated soils. Environmental contamination with Toxocara spp. eggs is a public health problem. Accidental swallowing of Toxocara canis eggs (a nematode of dogs) usually results on a zoonotic infection (toxocarosis). The objectives of this research were: 1) To test the presence of antagonistic fungi against T. canis in the soil in public places of La Plata city, Argentina, infected with eggs of this parasite, 2) To determine the possible association between biotic and abiotic factors of the soil with the presence of fungal parasites of egg nematodes. Soil samples were tested for: textural type, organic matter (%), pH, presence of egg-parasite fungi, of larvae and of nematode eggs, in particular of Toxocara spp. The studied area showed the following characteristics: pH: 6.6-8.0, organic matter: 1.2-70%, with a predominantly loam texture. The following antagonistic fungal genera were identified: Acremonium, Aspergillus, Chrysosporium, Fusarium, Humicola, Mortierella, Paecilomyces and Penicillium. A prevalence of 70% was detected for nematode eggs, of 33% for Toxocara spp. eggs and of 90% for larvae. No association between the presence of egg-parasite fungi and the considered factors was found. More studies are necessary to know the natural antagonism factors to T. canis eggs for its in situ biological control.</dc:description>
