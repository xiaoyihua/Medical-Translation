Complaints that human beings are capable of expressing are not so many, there are only a handful, and this work intends to be exhaustive in its exposition. It is possible to complain against third persons. It is also possible to do so against oneself assuming either the intransigent attitude of a father who judges a son who does not fulfill his expectancies, or as a son who resents the paternal demands which he feels he cannot comply. Other kind of complaints include physical symptoms, either isolated (cephalea, dysnea, urticaria) or constituting syndromes or illnesses. Losses suffered are also a source of complaints, whatever the lost object might be (person, situation, material things or a part of oneself). It can be mourned because of its absence, or else by feeling guilty of the real or imaginary damage inflicted or else by feeling indisolubly linked to it with a phantom tie. Other types of complaints are the feeling of dependancy towards something oppressive, be it a substance, such as alcohol, smoking, drugs or overeating, or it may be a person or a situation. In view of the compulsive addiction characteristics with which the subject lives, it is possible to assimilate this dependancy and the feeling of oppression and damage to the link with a toxic.</dc:description>
