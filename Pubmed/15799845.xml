<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Most studies of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) conducted in our environment concentrate in a single CVRF. The PREVENCAT study was designed to estimate the control of CVRF in the population attended in primary care presenting arterial hypertension (HT), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and/or hypercholesterolemia (HC) as well as to assess the prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD Multicenter, cross-sectional study, in patients with HT, DM2 and/or HC, consecutively recruited by primary care physicians in Spain. The blood pressure, cholesterol, basal glycaemia, obesity, smoking and physical activity were assessed. The degree of control of these CVRF and the prevalence of MS were estimated. RESULTS 2,649 patients were recruited, aged 64 (11.3) years, with a 51.6% of women. The most frequent diagnosis was HT (78.9%), followed by HC (58.4%) and DM2 (37.4%). In the whole sample, the percentages of patients who had a control or had initially normal values of blood pressure, cholesterol and basal glycemia were 40.0% (confidence interval [CI], 95% 38.2-41.9), 42.6% (95% CI, 40.5-44.7) and 62.7% (95% CI, 60.8-64.5), respectively. 15.6% of cases (95% CI, 14.3-17.0) had body mass index &lt; or = 25 kg/m2; 87.5% were non-current smokers (95% CI, 86.2-88.8); and 46.2% practiced regular physical activity (95% CI, 44.3-48.1). 40% of patients had &lt; or = 2 CVRF in good control. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 50.6% (95% CI, 48.7-52.5). CONCLUSIONS The control of the CVRF considered in primary care attended population is insufficient. Hardly one of each 2 patients with HT, DM2 and HC is under control. The overweight and sedentarism control is still poorer.</dc:description>
