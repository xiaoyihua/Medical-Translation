<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To present a relational analysis of how women who are diagnosed with the human papilloma virus (HPV), cervical dysplasia or cervical neoplasia receive or seek information, and how they experience this process within their immediate relationships. MATERIALS AND METHODS In 2008, 34 qualitative interviews were carried out with women at two Secretary of Health colposcopy clinics in Hermosillo, Sonora. Analysis was based on grounded theory. RESULTS There is a patent analogy between cervical cancer and death, much disinformation about HPV and dysplasias, and a persistent lack of timely and clear information given to patients by doctors. There is a stigma attached to HPV infection which affects women's immediate relationships. CONCLUSION Despite patients' need to obtain information, they do not demand it from their doctor, which contributes to their anguish and distrust.</dc:description>
