<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Gleason pathological score in prostate cancer is an important prognostic indicator. However, the concordance between the score of trans rectal needle biopsies and the final score of the surgical piece may be variable. AIM To analyze the concordance between Gleason scores of trans rectal prostate biopsies and those of the surgical piece obtained after prostatectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of 168 pathological records of radical prostatectomies, performed between 1993 and 2009. All these patients had also a trans rectal biopsy performed previously. Patients with less than 12 tissue cylinders obtained during the trans rectal biopsy or incomplete data were not included in this analysis. RESULTS Sixty eight percent of trans rectal biopsies had Gleason scores that were concordant with those of the surgical piece. The score was higher or lower in 27 and 10% of biopsies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Gleason scores of trans rectal biopsies and those of the surgical piece were concordant in 68% of cases in this series of pathological records.</dc:description>
