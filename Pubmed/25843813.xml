<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. Numerous studies have reported the association between GIST and other neoplasms. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the possible association between GIST and other tumors in a genetically isolated population. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted of patients with GIST between 2002 and 2009 at our center. Epidemiological, pathological and family data in patients with GIST alone (group A) were compared with those in patients with GIST associated with other neoplasms (group B). A possible common genetic mechanism was investigated between GIST and associated malignancies by testing the detection of the immunohistochemical marker, CD117, in all tumors. RESULTS Twenty-two patients with GIST were identified, 10 in group A (45%) and 12 in group B (55%). In group B, the associated tumor was malignant in 6 patients (50%) and benign in another 6 (50%). Of the 22 patients with GIST, 8 (36%) had a family history of malignancies. Of these 8 patients, 7 (87.5%) were in group B (p=0.03) and 3 (37.5%) showed the same pathological type of neoplasm as their relatives. All GIST were positive for CD117 whereas associated malignancies were negative for this marker. CONCLUSION We did not find immunohistochemical positivity for CD117 in malignancies associated with GIST. Given the special characteristics of the study population, the association between GIST and associated malignancies may be incidental.</dc:description>
