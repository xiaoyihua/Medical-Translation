<dc:description xml:lang="en">Purified Protein Derivatives (PPDs) are non-defined antigens prepared from mycobacteria cultures. They are usually employed to evaluate the specific cellular immune response both in animals and humans. Bovine and avian PPDs are usually employed as antigens in mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis and paratuberculosis. Nevertheless, PPD from Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, (PPDj) is neither commonly used nor frequently available. However, PPD from Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium is in fact used. We aimed to obtain and evaluate the performance of a PPDj from a local isolate of MAP using the ãInterferon-release assay. The stimulation of ãInterferon-release was significantly different between infected and control cattle when this antigen, named PPDj-IB, was used. Stimulation in the infected animals was similar with both antigens (PPDa and PPDj-IB). However, some animals were positively stimulated with PPDj-IB and not with PPDa. We demonstrated by Western blot that two antigenic molecules, lipoarabinoman and APA/ModD antigen were differentially represented in both PPDs. This could explain the difference in stimulation induction of yIFN observed at individual level. Although PPDj-IB could not improve PPDa performance, we could easily produce an effective purified protein derivative for in vitro assays.</dc:description>
