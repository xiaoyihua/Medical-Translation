<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study tries to identify the roles family members have in the care of an elderly person experiencing the effects of cerebral-vascular disease in the home and the main strategies to employ in the treatment of such a patient. The theoretical methodological procedure was based on a psychological project, a historical drawing about a theme, in which five subjects who were caretakers drew two achromatic pictures narrating corresponding stories individually in their homes. This form of expression allowed the project designers to have an interpretation of the daily situations involved in the care of these patients. In the first analysis phase, we drew the conclusion that caretakers construct their own particular knowledge system regarding the care of the elderly patient in their home. We verified that this construction started with a network relating common, daily elements which are interwoven in the treatment process occurring within a specific social milieu which as a result generates strategies that rely heavily on common sense knowledge in the manner of carrying out this social function.</dc:description>
