<dc:description xml:lang="en">Pyogenic liver abscesses in 20 adult patients were reviewed to evaluate if computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US) and percutaneous catheter drainage have improved prognosis of this disease. The average delay in diagnosis was 16 days. The CT sensitivity was 94% while the US sensitivity was 78%. The response to treatment with open surgery was compared to percutaneous drainage. Eleven patients were surgically drained with complications in 58% of them. Eight were treated with percutaneous drainage and no complication appeared as a result of treatment. One was found at autopsy. Days of hospitalization in surgically drained patients were significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than percutaneous drained patients. Percutaneous catheter drainage is recommended as method of choice for treating patients with pyogenic liver abscesses.</dc:description>
