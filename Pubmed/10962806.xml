<dc:description xml:lang="en">Fifty three patients (pts) received an allogeneic hematopoietic transplant using peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). Diagnosis were acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 16 pts, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 15, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in first chronic phase in 12, aplastic anemia in 4, myelodysplasia in 3 and Hodgkin's disease, major thalasemia and Hunter's syndrome in one each. Mean age was 20 years-old (2-55), 28 males and 25 females. Conditioning regimens were total body irradiation with 1200 cGy and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg in 38 pts, busulfan 16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg in 10 pts, total lymphoid irradiation and cyclophosphamide in 3, 2 pts received other chemotherapy based conditionings. PBPC were infused unmanipulated through a central catheter. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporin and short course methotrexate. Donors were 6/6 HLA compatible siblings in 52 cases and 5/6 match in one case. PBPC mobilization was done with G-CSF at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg/day subcutaneously for four days, pheresis started on day 5. Bone marrow harvest was also done in the first thirty cases. Mean cellularities for CD34, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD19 (cel x 10(6)/kg) were 4.12; 4.59; 2.57; 1.9; 0.55 and 0.68, respectively. Mean recovery of neutrophils &gt; 500/microL was obtained on day +11 and platelets &gt; 20,000/microL on day +13. Patients were hospitalized for a mean period of 26 days (range 18-39) and days with parenteral antibiotics were 12.2 (5-45). Two pts had venoocclusive disease of the liver. Transplant related mortality was 15%. Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was observed in 43.4% of pts, only 5 pts had acute GVHD III or IV. Mean time for aGVHD diagnosis was +23 (8-76). Forty three pts were evaluable for chronic GVHD with a mean follow-up of 18 months (4-39). Chronic GVHD was observed in 26.4% by day +240, only 2 pts developed severe cGVHD. The present experience demonstrates an acceptable incidence for cGVHD; however, taking into account recent reports showing an increase of this complication, it seems reasonable not to perform this procedure for non-malignant diseases in which graft versus malignancy effect is not to be expected.</dc:description>
