<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic utility, safeness, efficacy and complications of double balloon enteroscopy (DBE). METHODS This prospective, descriptive study of DBE took place between July 2010 and November 2011 at Gastroenterology Service of Hospital Nacional Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen-EsSalud. 33 DBE were performed in 30 patients with a double balloon enteroscope: EN-450T5 Fujinon, under conscious sedation and with previous bowel preparation. All of them signed an informed consent. RESULTS The mean hemoglobin was 9.16 gr. /dl. 16 patients (53%) had capsule endoscopy previous to the exam. The most frequent indication for DBE was gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. The per-oral route was used in 66.7% of the cases reaching a maximum distance of 206 cm. The mean examination time was 137 minutes. The most frequent finding was vascular ectasia. The diagnostic yield was 57.6% (similar to other published series). The therapeutic usefulness is equal to 45.4%. The therapeutic procedure most used was argon beam plasma (ABP). As published by other authors the exam was well tolerated by all patients with no complications after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS DBE is a secure, useful and efficient technique for the exploration and treatment of small bowel disease, mainly in the cases of gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin.</dc:description>
