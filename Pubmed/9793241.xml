<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To estimate the rates of avoidable pediatric hospitalization in the health areas of the Valencia Community and health sectors of Catalonia, and to analyze if they are related to socioeconomic level or development of primary care. METHOD Available paediatric (0-14 years old) hospitalizations were analyzed using the Minimum Basic Data Set of Hospital Discharge in two Autonomous Regions: the Valencia Community and Catalonia (1993-1994). Variables analyzed included age, gender, socioeconomic level and coverage by the new model of primary care. Crude and standardized rates for age were calculated and the variation in areas and sectors was assessed. The association between rates and socioeconomic and primary care characteristics was analyzed. RESULTS Avoidable paediatric hospitalizations represent 21% of all paediatric hospitalizations in the Valencia Community and 15% in Catalonia. Crude rates for Valencia Community ranged between 5.7 and 12.7 in 1993 and 6.6 and 17.8 in 1994; extreme quotient was 2.2 and coefficient of variation 37% in 1993 and 2.7 and 48% respectively in 1994. For Catalonia they ranged between 2.7 and 24.3 in 1993 and 1.4 and 23.8 in 1994; extreme quotient was 9 and coefficient of variation 52% in 1993, and 7 and 42% in 1994 respectively. All these differences were significant (p &lt; 0.005). There was no significant correlation between socioeconomic level and development of primary health care and rates of avoidable paediatric hospitalization by health areas or sectors. CONCLUSIONS Avoidable paediatric hospitalization represent a significant proportion of paediatric hospitalizations. There are differences in avoidable paediatric hospitalization rates by health areas and sectors, not associated with socioeconomic level and primary care indicators.</dc:description>
