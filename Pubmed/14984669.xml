<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with thrombocytopenia and fetal loss, and have been reported elevated in patients with preeclampsia-eclampsia. Site: Preeclampsia-Eclampsia Research Unit, Instituto Materno Infantil del Estado de Mexico, Toluca, Mexico and the Specialty Hospital Research Unit, La Raza Medical Center, Mexico City, Mexico. OBJECTIVE To determine the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG-IgM) as markers of acute endothelial damage in patients with preeclampsia. MATERIAL AND METHODS A randomized case control study composed of two groups: Group A (cases), 18 patients with preeclampsia-eclampsia and group B (control), 18 normal pregnancies. Antiphospholipid (anticardiolipin) antibodies were determined in both groups in addition to with coagulation tests and clinical variables in mother and newborn in day of admission and nine weeks after obstetrical resolution. We excluded patients with anticoagulant or dialysis therapy, taking NSAIDs or who recently required transfusion or plasmaferesis. RESULTS There were significant differences in levels of IgM and in weights and mortality among newborns between the two groups. In terms of maternal complications, we found HELLP syndrome as leading cause. We also observed in the case group significant differences in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and IgM levels between admission day and nine weeks later. Our results lead us to the conclusion that there must be exist immunologic mechanism that induces synthesis of anticardiolipin antibodies (IgM isotype) during acute state of the disease, accounting for vascular changes and prothrombotic state responsible for maternal and neonatal complications.</dc:description>
