<dc:description xml:lang="en">Adequate dialysis is defined as the quantity and the quality of the dialysis that is necessary for the patient to remain in good state, with no uremic symptoms, obtaining a longer survival with the best possible corrections of his uremia-related metabolic and systemic changes, and with the minimum possible morbidity in addition to a good quality of life. The good operation of a peritoneal dialysis schedule calls for a set of criteria and standards, as well as management clinical protocols according to which the healthcare team manages the dialysis technique and its complications, and uniforms the steps to be taken. Such protocols should be agreed to by the whole of team that enforces them, and should be submitted to a continuous update process based on the team's own experiences and also on the scientific literature. The results are periodically evaluated. Useful quality standards of clinical management, based on scientific evidence and on the opinions of expert nephrologists are needed with the aim to go in depth into specific aspects of the daily clinical action, by means of a rigorous and regular systematic review process that reflects all new advancements and technologies. The U.S. National Kidney Foundation (NKF) published in 1997 the Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative (DOQI) which were the first action guidelines, with the aim to improve dialysis' quality and results. The objective of the clinical guidelines is to act as an updating method and to unify criteria by contributing scientific evidence.</dc:description>
