<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The premenopause period is that which precedes the actual menopause, when a decrease of the ovarian hormones is present, leading to cardiovascular diseases as arterial hypertension, acute myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular diseases. OBJECTIVE We evaluated the antihypertensive response of the estradiol-medroxyprogesterone, to reduce arterial pressure in the premenopausal patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS In a clinical trial from March 1997 to September 1998, 106 patients with systemic hypertension, symptoms hypoestrogenism and estradiol levels less than 30 pg/mL were evaluated. They were randomized at a trial in two groups with pursuit of 6 months. Group A: 53 with captopril, Group B: 53 with estradiol-medroxyprogesterone. The arterial pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and symptoms hypoestrogenism were analyzed before and after the treatment. The statistical analysis was performed with Student T. RESULTS A decrease of arterial pressure was observed with estradiol, the same as with captopril with a p &lt; 0.05. Decrease of cholesterol and triglycerides were more significant in the estradiol group with a p &lt; 0.05. A bigger attenuation of symptoms of the hypoestrogenism existed in the estradiol group. CONCLUSIONS The antihypertensive response with estradiol was the same as with captopril in the premenopausal patient with systemic hypertension.</dc:description>
