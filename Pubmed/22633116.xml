<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To study the clinical manifestations and findings at venography in patients with pelvic congestion syndrome and to evaluate the outcome after percutaneous embolization using coils. MATERIALS AND METHODS We studied 34 women referred to the vascular radiology unit from the vascular surgery department for clinical suspicion of pelvic congestion syndrome. All patients underwent venography to assess the competence of the ovarian veins and to detect other varicose pelvic veins. When pelvic varicose veins were detected, they were embolized with coils. Clinical outcomes were recorded after reviewing the clinical history and administering a questionnaire over the phone. RESULTS In 22 of the 34 patients, signs of pelvic venous insufficiency were found. The symptoms were mainly pelvic and perineal heaviness (20/22) and pelvic pain (18/22). The technical success of venography and embolization was 100%, with three minor complications that did not require hospitalization. Pelvic heaviness improved in 14 patients (in 13 it was completely eliminated). Pain disappeared in 11 patients and was partially alleviated in another 2. CONCLUSION In patients with pelvic congestion syndrome, the embolization of insufficient pelvic veins achieves clinical improvement with short hospital stays and few complications.</dc:description>
