<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Health population inquiries give information about morbidity as perceived by people, the quality of medical care and the costs of diseases. AIM To inform the results on morbidity and medical care surveys performed in the Chilean cities of Antofagasta, La Serena, Concepción, Temuco, Llay Llay, Tiltil y Lampa-Batuco. MATERIAL AND METHODS A random sample of 951 dwellings with 4.192 people was selected and studied three times, in 1995 and 1996. All health events (acute and chronic disease episodes, accidents, health examinations, dental care) and the main features of medical care were registered in the interviews which covered a 2-week period each time. RESULTS Health events were registered in 30.1% people. When extrapolating fortnight findings to a one year period, each person had 2.37 annual episodes of acute diseases, 0.94 health examinations and 0.69 dental attentions. The prevalence of chronic diseases was 13.2%. The frequency of health events was higher among women and in elders. Hospital stays and deaths were less frequent in higher income levels. Most acute diseases were respiratory illnesses, followed by communicable diseases. The most important chronic diseases detected were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma and heart diseases. Medical care was provided in 66% of acute and 34% of chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS When comparing these results with previous surveys, an increase in the frequency of acute and chronic diseases is found.</dc:description>
