<dc:description xml:lang="en">Coronary artery revascularization surgery is well established procedure throughout the world. The benefits are based on the blood perfusion through the implanted grafts distal to the coronary occlusions and continue as long as the grafts remains patent. The immediate success of this procedure is related to the surgical technique and the anatomical characteristics of the grafted coronary arteries. However, the long term results are mainly dependent on the type of grafts used. The modern era of myocardial revascularization started in the sixties with the use of saphenous vein grafts by Johnson and Favaloro. Alternative vascular conduits to the saphenous vein have been tried, and the internal mammary artery has become the first choice. In recent years, various publications have demonstrated the supremacy of the internal mammary artery over the saphenous vein when used as a single, bilateral, sequential of free graft. In order to obtain full myocardial revascularization, the use of alternatives to the internal mammary artery is required. The gastroepiploic artery, the inferior epigastric artery and the radial artery have been used as alternatives to the saphenous vein with the hope of obtaining long term results similar to the internal mammary artery.</dc:description>
