<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Pontifical Catholic University of Chile founded its School of Medicine in 1930, preceded by the Schools of Medicine of the University of Chile (founded in 1833) and the University of Concepción (founded in 1924). The founders of the new School were prominent members of the Catholic Church, advised by distinguished Chilean physicians and scientists, most of them already full Professors at the University of Chile. During the first decades, only a small number of full-time faculties could be recruited and the academic team included mostly part-time teachers, generally shared with the already established Medical Schools, as well as practising physicians with little or no previous teaching experience. Along 75 years of fruitful existence, this Medical School has evolved to become one of the leading organizations in graduate and post-graduate medical education in Latin America, with high standards in teaching methodology and a superb productivity in clinical and biomedical research. The history of this Medical School stands as an example to the currently nascent Medical Schools founded by private universities in Chile. The standards of high quality medical education should be maintained for the well-being of our population so that these new Medical Schools can become respected and accepted as peers by the entire community of Chilean Universities.</dc:description>
