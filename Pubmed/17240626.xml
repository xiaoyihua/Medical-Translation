<dc:description xml:lang="en">Current knowledge of stroke risk factors and epidemiology is based mostly on USA or European studies; scarce data have been published from developing countries. Because epidemiological and clinical characteristics in stroke vary according to regional factors, we need to know the peculiarities of stroke on this subcontinent. The purpose is to describe the clinical subtypes and risk factors in patients with ischemic stroke. We analyzed all consecutive ischemic stroke in patients admitted at Hospital Italiano of Buenos Aires, between June 1, 2003 and June 1, 2005. Among 395 ischemic stroke patients, the mean age was 71.36 years (+/- 13.82) and 55% were male. Ischemic stroke subtypes were as follows: 40% patients had lacunar, 20% atherosclerotic stroke, 10% cardioembolic infarction, and 5% other causes of stroke. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipemia (50%) and prior stroke (34%) were the most frequent risk factors. Most patients with cortical symptoms had significant large-artery atherosclerosis (&gt; 70%). Stroke informations in developing countries is difficult to obtain. This could be the reason for the very few stroke registries in South America. Hypertension was the most frequent risk factor in our registry. The pattern of stroke subtypes seems to be different from that reported in other regions of the world, with a higher frequency of small-vessel disease.</dc:description>
