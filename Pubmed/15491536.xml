<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE Associations between human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and sarcoidosis have been reported in several studies. We aimed to investigate these associations in Turkish patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD We performed HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-D typing in 83 patients with sarcoidosis and in 250 healthy controls using a microlymphocytotoxicity method to investigate genetic susceptibility to the disease. RESULTS Because of significant violation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at HLA-C and HLA-DQB1 loci, only results obtained at other HLA loci were used. Although HLA-A9, HLA-B5, and HLA-B8 allele frequencies were significantly higher in the patient group compared to the controls (odds ratio [OR]= 21.8, P= .015; OR= 9.34, P= .049; OR= 2.26, P= .031, respectively), none of the differences remained significant after applying the Bonferroni correction. HLA-A24, HLA-A26, and HLA-B62 alleles were significantly less frequent in the patient group compared to the controls (OR= 0.48, P= .018; OR= 0.19, P= .003; OR= 0.11, P= .044, respectively). However, the differences also failed to remain significant after Bonferroni correction. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that both HLA may play significant roles (either increasing or reducing risk) in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and in its distinct clinical forms and laboratory findings.</dc:description>
