<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine demographic, clinical and health care factors associated to prevalence of burns in children less than 20 years of age in the districts of Cerro Navia, Lo Prado and Pudahuel, and their comparison with incidence in 2011. PATIENTS AND METHOD Population survey based on probability and two-stage stratified complex sample of households, registering 4,968 households. In 302 of them randomly selected, the mother/adult present at the time of the injury took a survey. A questionnaire of 50 questions (20 minutes), created by 6 experts and previously validated, was conducted by 10 interviewers and 3 supervisors. People were contacted by telephone before visiting them at their homes. The non-response rate was 6%, after up to 3 home visits. RESULTS Regarding prevalence, the male-to-female ratio was 1.16:1. Main reasons were hot objects (42.4%) and liquids (41.5%). 84.1% of burns occurred inside the home and in the afternoon (50.7%). 93.3% of the burns took place with an adult present. Hands were the most affected areas (46.7%). 30.2% were left with scars the first time of the accident. 34.4% of the burn victims did not require health care and 8.4% of them required hospitalizations. Over 60% of respondents reported that they poured cold water on the burn as a first step. CONCLUSION Relevant information was obtained to be used in burn prevention in children and adolescents. Recall bias is the main limitation of the study.</dc:description>
