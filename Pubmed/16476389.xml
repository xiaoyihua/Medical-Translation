<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Most Spanish dermatologists are members of the Spanish Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (AEDV). Their development and history can be considered to parallel each other. The aim of our study is to determine the role women have played in the AEDV throughout its history, both in number and as officers or directors. MATERIAL AND METHODS To obtain our data, we consulted AEDV's files from the time it was founded until the year 2002. We also asked other medical associations, obtaining a response from three of them. RESULTS No women joined the AEDV until 1964. After that date, the percentage rose slowly (1975, 5.5 %), until the last decade when it increased more sharply, reaching 41.34 % in 2001. There are only 11 women on the boards of directors, all in non-presidential roles. The percentages of women in Pediatrics, Ophthalmology and Pathology are similar. CONCLUSIONS The number of female dermatologists in the AEDV has increased gradually, although not steadily, reaching a maximum in the last decade. Women are rarely officers or directors, and there are no female presidents. The data shows that women have gradually become more prevalent in the medical profession, the same as in the rest of society as a whole.</dc:description>
