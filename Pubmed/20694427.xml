<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this descriptive, cross-sectional study, developed with 93 professionals, was to characterize the roles of the professionals who were working in the drug addiction outpatient centers of the city of Bogota, Colombia. The results showed that psychologists were the predominant professionals (38%), followed by occupational therapists (34%). Nurses corresponded to 8% of the professionals, with their roles predominantly in the aspects of health promotion and self care (100%), in the administrative area (43%) and in prevention (57%) and very little in rehabilitation and social rehabilitation (14%). The roles of the professionals agreed with the expected activities of the different professions, with the exception of the occupational therapists. It is considered that nurses need to gain more space within the team to focus on drug users.</dc:description>
