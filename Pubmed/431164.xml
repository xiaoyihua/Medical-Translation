<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authors present a 60-year-old patient undergoing periodic hemodialysis who, 3 years after beginning the treatment, developed a clinical picture consisting of disturbances of language, motor dispraxia, loss of memory and concentration, irritability, great change of personality, myoclonias and asterixis. This led progressively to a total loss of motor coordination, including speech. He died 5 months later in a state of dementia, psychosis and incontinence of sphincters. The symptomatology increased after hemodialysis sessions. The normal analytical studies carried out in these cases (electrocardiogram, electromyography, complete roentgenologic study) and also Zn, Cu, and ceruloplasmin measurements were normal. The electroencephalogram showed only a slow tracing with delta waves. Various etiopathogenic possibilities are commented on, as for example alterations in the dialysis water, the use of detergents in cleaning the artificial kidney, a syndrome of imbalance, a decrease in the body potassium and poisoning caused by certain metals such as tin, zinc and aluminium or by drugs which contain benzodiazepine derivatives. The authors conclude that the picture corresponds to a metabolic encephalopathy.</dc:description>
