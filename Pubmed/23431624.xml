<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION the infection caused by Paracapillaria philippinensis (Capillaria philippinensis) is clinically characterized as a progressive enteric illness with massive loss of proteins and a malabsorption syndrome that may become fatal. OBJECTlVE: the first report in Cuba of human infection with P. philippinensis. METHODS the case of a Cuban male patient aged 21 years from the City of Havana, who had never been abroad, was described. This young man was admitted to the hospital because after having eaten one breadcrumb-covered fish, he started having diarrheic episodes that progressively increased up to more than 15 abundant diarrheas per day, without phlegm or blood, and a clinical picture of severe malnutrition and general symptoms of intensive asthenia and anorexia. RESULTS the lab diagnosis confirmed the presence of P. philippinensis eggs in feces. CONCLUSIONS the clinical features of the patient and the finding of moderate eosinophilia in the hematological study agreed with published information. As far as we know, this is the first finding of a human infection caused by P. philippinensis in Cuba, and in the American continent as well. The epidemiological alert on the possible emergence of new cases of this parasitic infection in our geographic zone is important, mainly in those places where the habit of eating raw or undercooked fish is part of the local culture.</dc:description>
