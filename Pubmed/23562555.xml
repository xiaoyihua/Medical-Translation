<dc:description xml:lang="en">Pyomyositis, an acute bacterial infection of skeletal muscle, is caused by Staphylococcus aureus or other gram-positive organisms in &gt;90% of cases. A 19-year-old boy with severe idiopathic aplastic anemia presented a pyomyositis of inner thigh muscles due to Escherichia coli as a complication of his underlying disease. The diagnosis was established by means of soft tissue ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood culture. Surgical debridement and antibiotic treatment were performed. Postoperative course was uneventful and pyomyositis was successfully resolved. Pyomyositis caused by E. coli is uncommon condition, and very few cases have been reported, most of them being severe immunodeficiency patients, but we should know the existence of this entity and its management.</dc:description>
