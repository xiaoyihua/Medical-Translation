<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Occult bacteremia represents 3% of blood cultures drawn in the Emergency Department. In most cases, the evolution is unknown. The aim of the study is to analyze the results obtained after implementation of an intervention program for these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS We describe the results of an early intervention program for patients with bacteremia in the Emergency Department discharged at home, which was implemented in daily clinical activity in Costa del Sol Hospital in Marbella (Malaga). We analyze the epidemiological, microbiological, Charlson comorbidity index, Pitt bacteremia index and 30-day mortality. RESULTS During 15 months, 90 patients were located. The median age was 67 years. There was a predominance of males with 54 of cases (60%). The acquisition place was predominantly the community with 51 cases (56.6%), being the most frequent microorganism Escherichia coli with 31 cases (34.4%). The median Charlson index and the bacteremia Pitt index were 1. Thirty-eight of the cases required hospitalization (42.2%). Pitt bacteremia index&gt;1 and exchange antibiotic treatment were the related variables with need for admission. One patient died (1.2%) and 6 patients could not be located (6.6%). CONCLUSIONS The implementation of programs of early identification and management of patients with bacteremia in Emergency Department discharged al home allows early recovery of patients who require hospital admission and antibiotic treatment optimization. In our series, mortality after early intervention was low (1.2%).</dc:description>
