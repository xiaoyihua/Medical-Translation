<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) are a frequent cause of consultation in emergence services, and complicated cases require hospitalization. However there are few data in our setting about the clinical characteristics of these infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective review of hospital admitted patients with a diagnosis of folliculitis, cellulitis, erysipelas, abscesses, hidradenitis, furuncle, impetigo, fasciitis and Fournier's gangrene. Cases were extracted from the data base of diagnostic codes of the Archive and Clinical Documentation Department of Son Llàtzer Hospital from January 2002 to November 2011. RESULTS We studied 996 episodes in 841 hospitalized patients with any diagnosis of SSTIs. Cellulitis/erysipelas (66.7%) was the most frequently diagnosed condition, with 77% of all SSTIs being community acquired, and the majority of patients had comorbidities, mainly diabetes (33%) and heart failure (17.7%). The most frequent isolated microorganism was S.aureus (35.1%), in 19 (12.9%) cases with methicillin-resistance (MRSA), 84.2% of them were nosocomial or health care acquired. Monotherapy with aminopenicillin with clavulanic acid was the empiric treatment most frequently used (35.5%). New antibiotics for Gram-positive cocci (linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline) were used in patients with comorbidities that presented more complications (P&lt;.001) and more risk of mortality (P=.001). During admission 10.9% of patients died, but only in 2.7% of them mortality was related to the SSTIs. CONCLUSIONS SSTIs attended most frequently in hospitalized patients are mainly cellulitis/erysipela, the majority community acquired. MRSA infections are mainly health care related. Use of new antibiotic for Gram-positive cocci was limited.</dc:description>
