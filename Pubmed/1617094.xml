<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To find the extent of cognitive deterioration and dementias and their approximate etiology, in Pamplona's geriatric population. DESIGN Crossover study. SITE. Pamplona's geriatric population. PATIENTS AND OTHERS PARTICIPANTS Sample of 393 people over 64, drawn in random fashion from among the population of this age Pamplona. Ordered according to sex and age group. MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS The diagnostic sequence followed for the evaluation of the level of cognitive deterioration was that of Folstein's Minimental test; then the DSM-111 criteria for diagnosing dementia; and the attempt to define dementias by means of the Hachinski scale. Scores lower than 24 were observed in 24.9% of old people, reaching 82.8% in those over 84. Dementia affected 8.9% of people older than 64, and as many as 55.2% of those over 84. The aetiology of these dementias is, according to the Hachinski scale, parenchymatous in 42.8% of cases, mixed or doubtful in another 42.8% and vascular in 14.4%. Both the low educational level of those patients suffering dementia and their serious functional deterioration were notable. CONCLUSIONS A high level of dementias exists in our elderly population. A big percentage of these are overlooked as concrete clinical phenomena, although their formal diagnosis at the Primary Care stage is relatively simple and extremely useful in order to tackle the earliest and most treatable cases.</dc:description>
