<dc:description xml:lang="en">The author says that, in the health field, training in supervision should be based on research. This approach would make it possible to draw up a scheme for supervision with a scientific basis as a guide to the training of the required personnel. He points out that the negative image of the supervisor as one who conspires against individual creativity and cowers the subordinate, has to be overcome. Supervision must be accompanied by counseling, and give the subordinate an opportunity to contribute to the solutions of problems. The basic principles of the proposed supervision for education are, summarily, safeguarding the integrity of the worker, support to his talent, participation of the subordinate in his own evaluation, and the avoidance of threats, insecurity and punishment as a consequence of supervision. Finally, he proposes that all supervision must have a continuing education program as a response.</dc:description>
