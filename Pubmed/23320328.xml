<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of chondroid matrix-producing cells; based on its frequency, it is the second most common malignant bone tumor (10-20%) and responds poorly to chemo- and radiotherapy. It is infrequent in the pelvis. It has a rapid growth potential. The indicated treatment is broad resection with tumor-free margins. Pelvic reconstruction after resection is controversial. The current management of musculoskeletal neoplasias has a two-fold purpose. First of all, controlling the neoplasia by means of surgeries with cancer-free margins and, second, performing procedures for the reconstruction of the involved segment achieving limb preservation with maximum functionality. OBJECTIVE Intrapelvic reconstruction with the proximal third of the ipsilateral femur in a patient with a chondrosarcoma in Enneking-Dunham's zone II. And placement of an unconventional femur prosthesis. CLINICAL CASE We present herein the case of a 58 year-old male, with a lytic lesion of the right acetabulum. The patient completed the diagnostic protocol, and the biopsy result was dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. CONCLUSION The purpose of the surgical technique is to use the proximal third of the femur as a novel reconstruction alternative with massive autograft for tumor lesions located in Enneking-Dunham zone II.</dc:description>
