<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Controversy exists as to whether cystocele has a causative role in bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between cystocele and bladder outlet obstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two hundred women undergoing a urodynamic study from December 2007 to December 2008 were retrospectively assessed. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A: Patients with no cystocele (Grade 0) and Grade I cystocele Group B: Patients with Grade II-IV cystocele. EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1. Absence of flowmetry or voided volume &lt; 150 ml. 2. Neurological disorders. 3. History of urogenital surgery. Bladder outlet obstruction was defined as follows: Postvoid residue (PVR) &gt; 20%; peak flow (Qmax) &lt; 15 ml/sec; detrusor pressure at maximum flow (PdetQmax) &gt; 25 cm H2O. RESULTS Group A included 64% of patients, and Group B the remaining 36%. A pathological PVR &gt; 20% was found in 26.6% and 40.3% of patients in Group A and Group B respectively (p=0.04). A Qmax &lt; 15 mL/sec was seen in 15.6% and 27.8% of Group A and Group B patients respectively (p=0.03). A PdetQmax &gt; 25 cm H2O was found in 26.3% and 47.8% of Group A and Group B patients respectively (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS A statistically significant association exists between cystocele and bladder outlet obstruction.</dc:description>
