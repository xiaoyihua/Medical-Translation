<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED An open fracture is one in which the bone segments penetrate into the skin leaving the bone in contact with the outer environment. Many microorganisms may cause wound infection in open fractures; the most common one is Staphyloccocus aureus. METHODS This study included a group of 75 patients of both genders seen from November 1st, 2009 to April 30, 2010. A sample for culture was taken upon admission and incubated for 48 hours. RESULTS A total of 75 patients were included, 62 males and 13 females. The age range was 18 to 83 years. The tibia and the fibula were the most commonly affected bones. The most common mechanisms of injury resulted from high energy. The most frequent grade of exposure was III B. Forty-six percent of the culture results were negative at 48 hours; the most frequent organisms found in the positive cultures were Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. CONCLUSIONS Males are the gender most affected by open fractures. This kind of condition occurs at productive ages. The time elapsed between the injury and the onset of treatment was significant. The culture results showed that the most frequent organism was Staphylococcus aureus, together with Candida albicans.</dc:description>
