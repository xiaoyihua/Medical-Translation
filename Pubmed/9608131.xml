<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To find the view of Primary Care doctors in relation to the need for a community programme of breast cancer screening, its effectiveness and the criteria underlying its application. DESIGN Crossover study. SETTING Municipal districts of Ciutat Vella and Sant Martí, Barcelona. PARTICIPANTS General Practitioners (GPs) in the programme. INTERVENTION A self-filled questionnaire. The questions sought the level of agreement with 11 statements concerning: importance as health problem, effectiveness of the programmes, target population and role of GP. Results were compared for: year of graduation, sex and type of centre. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 140 doctors, 110 (78.6%) replied. There was majority agreement with all the statements, especially so in: "Breast cancer is one of the three main causes of death in women in Barcelona"; "screening of 50-64-year old women should be recommended"; and "GPs must recommend screening to their patients". CONCLUSION The replies to the questionnaire indicated agreement with the programme's basic orientation, except for including 40 to 49-year old women in the programme, which the programme did not propose. Hopefully, this consensus will help Primary Care professionals become involved in the screening programme.</dc:description>
