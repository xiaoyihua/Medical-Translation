<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this life of ours, the most important thing is life itself--even though this sounds like a truism. However, perspectives differ when it comes to evaluating life; that is, what are we able and willing to "pay" just for keeping it? Without mentioning that risking one's own life may be a source of profit. At times. Besides, other people's life is appraised according to different criteria: Some circumstances suggest that disposing of others' life--i.e. eliminating it good and proper--is advisable. Whenever such a decision is made, apparently for the sick person's own good, the physician in charge must go in for it. In such cases, the conditioning factors of a physician's behavior are questionable. Brain death, for instance, is a good example.</dc:description>
