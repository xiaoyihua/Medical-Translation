<dc:description xml:lang="en">This prospective study evaluated the effects of cisapride on corrected QT interval (QTc) in infants and children. From October 2000 to March 2003 two electrocardiograms (ECG) were obtained for 175 children (ranging in age from 1.5 months to 16.8 years), before and after 15 days of treatment with cisapride (0.2 mg/kg/dose, 3-4 times/day). A single posttreatment ECG was also obtained for 24 patients (ranging in age from 1.5 month to 15.8 years). No statistically significant differences were found between the mean QTc interval before (0.390 [0.018 s]) and after treatment (0.391 [0.018 s]). In patients for whom only a posttreatment ECG recording was performed, mean QTc interval was 0.399 (0.018 s). The QTc interval was never longer than 0.450 s in any of the children. In our experience the use of cisapride at therapeutic doses in infants and children who have no associated risk factors does not significantly prolong QTc interval.</dc:description>
