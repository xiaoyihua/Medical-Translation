<dc:description xml:lang="en">Studies on hypermobility have aroused great interest in the last decades, as they are associated to musculoskeletal disorders, as well as abnormalities in several organic systems, such as the mitral valve prolapse. Therefore, in this study, data on the association between joint hypermobility and the mitral valve prolapse were investigated and reviewed. Studies in the literature have shown that genetic alterations in the collagen composition seem to be the main cause of this association.</dc:description>
