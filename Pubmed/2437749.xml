<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED 24 children whose ages ranged from 10 days to 14 years (x 5.5. ys.), 16 males and 8 females, hospitalized in our Service on account of extra-digestive were studied. Creatinine and amylase determination were performed on serum and 24 hs. urine specimens; lipase activity was measured only in serum. Amylase-creatinine clearance ratio varied between 1.3 and 5.8% (x 3.1 +/- 1.3). Serum amylase ranged from 36 to 460 U/l (x 123 U/l). Five patients had hyperamylasemia. 2 were urlian parotiditis, 2 were under clinical surveillance after surgery and the last one was a septic meningitis. All of them showed amylase-creatinine ratio values up to 2.5%. Serum lipase ranged from 6 to 197 U/l (x 79 U/l), falling into the normal interval. No abnormal clearance was found. CONCLUSIONS hyperamylasemia is not specific for pancreatic disturbances in children; the serum lipase and the amylase-creatinine clearance ratio seem to be useful tools to rule out pancreatic involvement in hyperamylasemic patients.</dc:description>
