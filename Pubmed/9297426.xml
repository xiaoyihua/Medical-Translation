<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE A prospective study was performed to assess the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of RSV infections in hospitalized infants. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between October 1988 and September 1991, we studied 322 cases of RSV respiratory infections diagnosed by EIA of nasopharyngeal lavage and/or serology by complement fixation. Clinical, analytical and radiological data were reviewed. RESULTS Time-analysis showed higher incidences of RSV infections in December, January, November and February, with an increase in hospital admissions due to respiratory problems before the peak in RSV infections. The mean age of the population was 6.84 +/- 7.07 months. The mean weight was 7.4 +/- 2.68 kg and the sex distribution was 61.2% males and 38.8% females. Blood count was not useful in the differential diagnosis between bronchiolitis/bronchitis and pneumonias, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was higher in the last group (25.2 +/- 20.1 versus 38.2 +/- 29.5, t = 2.52, p &lt; 0.05). Clinical status, with a mean value of 6.09 +/- 2.31 as assessed by the modified Downes's Score, showed a significant relationship with the time of hospitalization (mean: 8.77 days; r = 0.2108, p &lt; 0.01), but not with gas exchange, weight or age. Chest X-rays showed air trapping in 48% of the cases, but the incidence of condensation was lower than in other series (16%), probably because we do not believe that any infiltration of the lungs on chest roentgenograms places the patients in the pneumonia category. CONCLUSIONS We found a high frequency of RSV infection among hospitalized infants and there was seasonal variation with a higher incidence during the winter months.</dc:description>
