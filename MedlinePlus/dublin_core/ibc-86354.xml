<dc:description xml:lang="es">Aim: The Simple and Comprehensive Model (MODSI) was applied to know the levels of risk of musculoskeletal disorders. Materials and Methods: Eighteen jobs were analyzed according to MODSI procedure, each activity was filmed in real time for studying the biomechanics of labor demand. The heart rate (HR) was measured electronically. Perceived exertion (PE) by the worker according to the activity was evaluated using the Borg Scale. Psychosocial Factors (SPF) as initiative, social status and identification with the activity were studied. Results: In 62% of the jobs the risk level was high to extremely high. It was found a significant association (P &lt;0.05) between the cardiovascular response of the worker and less neutral postures. The EP was closely related to HR (P &lt;0.05) in those high physical demands of work and continuous dynamics. Only in 8 working activities FPS were presented as stressful. Conclusions: We conclude that MODSI is easy to apply, and its components are able to discriminate the factors determining the level of risk of muscle-skeletal disorders (AU)</dc:description>
