<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To report our series of patients undergoing hand-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy (HALNU) using the pluck-off procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty patient undergoing HALMU for upper urinary tract urothelial tumors from November 2002 to December 2007 were assessed. Demographic, clinical, surgical, and oncological data were assessed. RESULTS Mean patient age was 69 years. Mean operating time and mean intraoperative bleeding were 176 min and 381 mL respectively. Twenty percent of patients required transfusion of blood products. Conversion to open surgery was not required in any patient. Major and minor complications occurred in 25% and 30% of patients respectively.Mean time to oral intake was 48 hours, and mean hospital stay was 5 days.Pathological study revealed transitional cell carcinoma in all cases: grade I in 5%, grade II in 60%, and grade III in 35% of patients. Clinical stage was pTa in 5%, pT1 in 20%, pT2 in 25%, pT3 in 40%, and pT4 in 10% of patients. A bladder recurrence rate of 30% and a 49% overall survival were seen after a mean follow-up of 33 months (5-73). Six-year cancer-specific survival was 67%. No patient developed either peritoneal or surgical bed recurrence. CONCLUSIONS HALMU using the pluck-off procedure is a feasible, safe, and effective surgery. Both surgical and oncological results are similar to those of open surgery and pure laparoscopy.</dc:description>
