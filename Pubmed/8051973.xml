<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The presentations of intravenous or depot bromocriptine (bromocriptine LA or long acting, Pariodel LA and bromocriptine LAR or long acting repeatable, Pariodel LAR) have improved the efficacy and the tolerance of oral bromocriptine. In contrast to bromocriptine LA, bromocriptine LAR may be repeatedly administered intramuscularly. METHODS Five patients with macroprolactinoma and 4 with microprolactinoma were included in the study. A 50 mg bottle of bromocriptine LAR was administered intramuscularly every month, over a minimum period of 6 months. PRL was determined prior to the study, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days following the initial dose of bromocriptine and thereafter with monthly periodicity. RESULTS The PRL values decreased in those patients with macroprolactinomas following the administration of bromocriptine LAR; in 2 patients the monthly doses of bromocriptine LAR was increased to 100 mg since the month after the initial dose PRL remained greater than 200 ng/ml with serum RPL normalizing in most of the patients at 6 months of treatment. In two of the three patients who presented visual changes a clear improvement was observed and in all the cases a reduction in the size of the macroprolactinoma was found upon CAT control at 6 months. The PRL values also decreased in the patients with microprolactinomas following administration of bromocriptine LAR, although the response was not as homogeneous as in the patients with macroprolactinomas due to that at 6 months 2 patients continued to have slightly elevated serum PRL levels. The microadenoma persisted in the control CAT at 6 months except in one case. Local and general tolerance to bromocriptine LAR was very good. CONCLUSIONS This study indicates good tolerance to bromocriptine LAR, being a therapeutic option in the treatment of macroprolactinomas.</dc:description>
