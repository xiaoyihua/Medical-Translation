<dc:description xml:lang="en">Epidemical, clinical, biochemical, cytological and immunological aspects are studied in ten cases of hepatitis occurred endemically in a chirurgical ward between cancerous operated patients. Three were HBsAg positive. None of the others seven had clinical or serological dates enough to attribute them to A nor B virus hepatitis. The clinical and serological data exclude also Epstein-Barr virus or Toxoplasma aethiology. Nevertheless, the objective results of the study have entity enough to classify the other seven no-A no-B hepatitis cases into the group of the cytomegalovirus hepatitis. The high number of positive titles for antibodies anti-CMV in the staff members of the chirugical ward, some with high rates, allow us to give them a role in the spread of the virus and his transmission to the patients' through a failure with the hygenic conditions necessary to look after the wounds.</dc:description>
