<dc:description xml:lang="en">Head injury continues to be the main cause of mortality and morbidity among young people in Europe. The use of technology in managing severe head injury has increased considerably and certain applications may be confusing to physicians who have little experience in neurology but who are charged with providing neurocritical care. Monitoring of brain-injured patients usually focuses on managing intracranial pressure and recording perfusion pressure. New techniques have recently been incorporated into routine monitoring of oxygenation and metabolism in the brain. Continuous monitoring of the partial oxygen pressure of brain tissue (PtO2) has become more common in neurocritical care units, making bedside evaluation of the effects of injuries and therapeutic measures possible. This review discusses technical, safety, and reliability aspects of PtO2 monitoring and its potential advantages in comparison with other techniques for evaluating brain tissue oxygenation.</dc:description>
