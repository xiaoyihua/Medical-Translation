<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Epidemiological studies on acute transverse myelitis (ATM) in South America are scarce. The aim of our study was to describe demographic, clinical and para-clinical features of patients with ATM in a health care organisation in Buenos Aires. A further objective was to determine the aetiologies of ATM. METHODS All patients diagnosed with ATM between June 1, 2002 and June 30, 2010 were retrospectively identified, using the Transverse Myelitis Consortium Working Group criteria. RESULTS A total of 40 patients diagnosed with ATM, (24 females, 60%) were included. The mean follow-up was 57 ± 8 months. The principal cause of myelitis found was ATM secondary to demyelinating disease (55%). Idiopathic ATM was diagnosed in 15 (37.5%) cases in the sample. The majority of patients had an extensive cord lesion (50%) detectable with spinal MRI. CONCLUSION There are few epidemiological studies concerning ATM in Argentina, and we believe that it is important to be aware of the manner in which this condition manifests itself in this region. We would therefore be able to compare them with studies previously published in other countries.</dc:description>
