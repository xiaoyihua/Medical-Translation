<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To find the use of family planning methods during breast-feeding and establish whether there is a relationship with social-demographic questions or the breast-feeding. Secondly, to evaluate nursing mothers' understanding of these methods. DESIGN An observational, crossover study using a self-administered questionnaire. SETTING Primary care. PARTICIPANTS 398 women in their 7th month of breast-feeding were chosen by simple random sampling from the register of births. Reply rate: 85.2%. MEASUREMENTS The use of contraceptive methods (CM), type of breast-feeding, social-demographic characteristics, information received and women understanding of family planning (additive Likert-type scale). RESULTS 78% of the women interviewed said they used some CM after delivery: barrier methods were the most common (63.7%). Use was significantly greater in women with a lower level of information or who had previously used CM. CONCLUSIONS Women with a lower level of information or who had used family planning methods previously said they used them more during breast-feeding. There is insufficient information about contraceptive methods during this period, especially among less educated women. Understanding of CM increases when breast-feeding lasts longer. Activities performed by health staff are not connected to women better understanding of contraception.</dc:description>
