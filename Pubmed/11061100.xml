<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Solar or actinic prurigo (PS) is one of the most common skin diseases observed in our country, particularly in the pediatric age; in our institution it is on the 14 place with a frequency of 1.34%. It represents an abnormal reaction to solar light and in its pathogenesis diverse factors participate, mainly immunogenetical and environmental. Although their clinical characteristics are already specified, the histopathological features are still not well documented. MATERIAL AND METHODS We carried out a retrospective and observational study in order to analyze the histopathologic changes in 20 samples of skin coming from 20 pediatric patients with PS; in all of them diagnosis was well established on clinical criteria. RESULTS Twenty children with PS of more than one year of evolution, ten of each sex, all mestizos or indigenous inhabitants of Mexico City and vicinity; we identified recent and late lesions, with epidermal and dermal changes, the more conspicuous were: spongiotic papules usually with psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, in association with perivascular, superficial and mild lymphocytic infiltrates, usually with few eosinophils, exocytosis of lymphocytes into the epidermis, pigment incontinence and extravasation of erythrocytes. CONCLUSIONS The PS is an inflammatory cutaneous disease for which histopathological diagnosis is feasible of being established on skin biopsies of recent or late lesions.</dc:description>
