<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To know the main epidemiologic characteristics of Meniere's disease in Cantabria. METHODS All the patients diagnosed of "definitive" Meniere's disease between 1992 and 2002 in Sierrallana Hospital of Torrelavega (Cantabria, Spain) were reviewed. Incidence, prevalence, presence of bilateral disease, age at diagnosis and gender were recorded. RESULTS A total of 75 patients were diagnosed of "definitive" Meniere's" disease" during this time. The incidence was 3/100,000 people/year, the prevalence 75/100,000, male/female ratio was 0.38. Most frequent age at onset was between 40 and 60 years and bilateral cases were 5.3%.
