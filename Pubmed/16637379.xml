<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of the office hysteroscopy in the treatment of the endouterine pathologies. DESIGN retrospective, descriptive and observational. PATIENTS AND METHOD We included all the office hysteroscopies performed since February-2000 to August-2004 (n=84) in a private medical office. We performed 32 diagnostic procedures without anesthesia and 52 operative procedures with anesthesia (I.V. sedation). We used a Karl Storz diagnostic telescope and a Bettocchi operative telescope. RESULTS Postoperative care was in the office since 90 minutes and all patients went home without complications, Mean age of the patients was 38+/-10 years. The indications to perform the procedure were infertility and abnormal transvaginal bleeding. There were not complications. All of the diagnostic procedures were done without anesthesia and we verified patient satisfaction with a pain store since 1 to 10 points. Twenty patients could get pregnant after the procedure and in two patients we detected endometrial carcinoma. CONCLUSION With these results, we can assume that office hysteroscopy is a procedure with minimal complications when is performed by expert hands and with excellent patients' satisfaction and benefit.</dc:description>
