<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The consequences of alcohol intake can be public health problems. A well-constructed classification system of alcohol consumers will assist in designing strategies for mitigation and control of alcohol-induced behaviors. OBJECTIVE A categorization of alcohol consumers was developed based on a set of consumer-associated variables. MATERIAL AND METHODS A set of 1,199 subjects between 18 and 60 years old was selected and each subject classified in three categories of alcohol intake: type A, intake desirable; type B, excessive consumption without related problems; and type C, problematic consumption or dependence. Using multinomial logistic regression model, the decisive variables of each category were fixed. RESULTS Subject with positive expectations associated with consumption such as increase in expressivity and the sexuality have 1.6 (95% CI; 1.0 - 2.5) times greater probability to be placed in the C category that those without those expectations. For relationships associated with inhibition and feelings of power, this risk even greater- 2.2 (95%CI; 1.1- 4.3). Age is in an inverse relationship and a protective factor to be classified type B or C. Men have a greater probability than women to be classes in B or C; this probability is the same as subjects who indicate having moderate pleasure or a rise in pleasure induced by the alcoholic drinks. DISCUSSION The results can be translated into programs for interventions at the population level directed to groups of higher risk, such as scholars and preteens, and with a gender focus. The personality element on which to focus the intervention is that of self-esteem. This is an element built from a behavioral-cognitive perspective within the context of the social and cultural learning process.</dc:description>
