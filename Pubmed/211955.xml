<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mixed and monoxenic cultures of rectal exudates from three patients with amebiasis of colon, and of feces from three asymptomatic carriers of Entamoeba histolytica obtained after administration of a saline cathartic, and from a case of exudate of the perianal cutaneous lesion border produced by this parasite, were done. The culture media used were for: mixed culture, Boeck and Drbohlav modified culture and, for monoxenic culture, Diamond's monophasic TP-S-1 medium without vitamin mixture and using bovine serum. In order to inhibit the bacterial growth in the mixed culture, streptomycin sulphate and pencillin G were used. In order to eliminate the bacterial flora kanamicin sulphate, chloramphenicol, gentamycin and disodic carbenicillin were added. Mixed cultures of seven strains of Entamoeba histolytica were obtained: HM22:IMSS, HM23:IMSS, HM24:IMSS, HM26:IMSS, HM27:IMSS, HM28:IMSS y HM29:IMSS, and monoxenic culture with Bacteroids symbiosus of the strains HM22:IMSS and HM27:IMSS, with a previous adaptation in mixed culture. The adaptation of HM26:IMSS strain in monoxenic culture was obtained by means of direct seeding of the rectal exudate with Fusobacterium symbiosus.</dc:description>
