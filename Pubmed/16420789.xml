<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The aims of the present study were to investigate cyclooxygenase-2 expression in neoplastic cells from colorectal carcinoma and to study the role of cyclooxygenase-2 expression as a prognostic factor related to distant metastases and survival. PATIENTS AND METHOD A retrospective study of 105 patients with sporadic colorectal cancer was performed. The patients underwent surgery at the General Surgery Department of the University Hospital of Jaén between 1991 and 1997. Several clinicopathological features were recorded: gender, tumor location, TNM stage, histological type and grade and the presence of venous or lymphatic invasion. The mean time of follow-up was 54 months. Immunohistochemistry: cyclooxygenase-2 expression was tested using avidin-biotin-peroxidase immunostaining. Both the intensity and extension of the stain were assessed. RESULTS Cyclooxygenase-2 expression in neoplastic cells was considered to be positive in 38 cases (36.2%). No statistically significant relationship was found between cyclooxygenase-2 expression and the clinicopathological features recorded (P &gt;.05). Tumor recurrence: Distant metastases were diagnosed in 14 patients (13.3%). Cyclooxygenase-2 did not show a significant relationship with metastases in the multivariate analysis (HR: 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07-1.69). Survival: Mean survival time was 55 months. Multivariate analysis did not show cyclooxygenase-2 as an independent risk factor of death (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.22-1.21). CONCLUSIONS Cyclooxygenase-2 expression was not significantly related to clinical and histopathological features of the tumors nor was it an independent risk factor of tumour recurrence or survival.</dc:description>
