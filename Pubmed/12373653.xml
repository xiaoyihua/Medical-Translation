<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT Due to the vast number of different circumstances surrounding them, the frequency with which post traumatic epileptic seizures occur varies greatly from study to study. Immediate and early epileptic seizures, within a week of the traumatism having taken place, are usually of little importance as regards the risk of post traumatic seizures. The most important factors governing the presentation of post traumatic seizures have to do with the seriousness of the injury, the extension of the brain tissue that is affected and the penetrating nature of the brain traumatism. CONCLUSION Although antiepileptic medication significantly reduces the risk of early seizures from occurring, a review of well designed clinical trials has found no evidence that these drugs reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with head injuries, or the appearance of late seizures.</dc:description>
