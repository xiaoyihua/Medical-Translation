<dc:description xml:lang="es">Objective: Low back pain is one of the most frequent symptoms in the general population. The sacroiliac joint dysfunction is a known cause of low back pain. Some studies have found that the clinical characteristic and physical examination findings are consistently capable of identifying dysfunctional sacroiliac joint as pain generators. However many factors can impact on the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic. In this context, we think that a test score (SI5) may be performed to assess diagnostic utility of clinical signs and radionuclide bone scanning of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The primary aim of the present study was to conduct conducting the pilot study of our new test score SI5. Methods: After reviewing the literature about of clinical characteristic, diagnostic test and imaging of the sacroiliac joint; we evaluated diagnostic utility of these aspects and developed the SI5 test score. The SI5 test score was performed in 68 patients with low back pain including completion of a standard questionnaire, history, physical examination performed by a physician, and evaluation of the results. Patients included in this study were assigned to one of four groups: A group of pain from facet joints, the second group with radicular pain, others patients were designed in the sacroiliac pain group and last group with other causes of low back pain. Results: All patients with diagnostic of sacroiliac joint dysfunction had a SI5 test score SI5 of 4 to 5; instead the patients in the other groups had less than 4 point in the test score. The frequency of all criteria of the SI5 test score was higher in the patients of sacroiliac pain group than in the other groups. Discussion and conclusions: Sacroiliac joints have been shown to be capable of producing pain in the low back; however, the diagnostic value of examination tests for sacroiliac joint pain has been questioned previously by other authors. More research is needed to guide clinicians on the choice of examination procedures and interventions for patients with pain which may be arising from the sacroiliac joint. The pilot study of SI5 test score provides an opportunity to gather both quantitative and qualitative data about the test. This study required statistical procedures that yield appropriate results (AU)</dc:description>
