<dc:description xml:lang="en">The presence of oligohydramnios evaluated by accumulation or major pool technique in pre-term PMR is strongly correlated with maternal and perinatal infection. The objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of amniotic fluid volume rate (AFVR) in prediction of maternal and fetal-neonatal infection in patients with PMR before 37 weeks. Thirty patients with PMR were prospectively studied. AFVR was done in all the patients at the time of arrival and they were managed conservatively. None of them had utero-inhibitors and only antibiotics were used after chord clamping. In absence of intrauterine infection corticotherapy was allowed. The results of AFVR were correlated with maternal infection (chorioamnioitis) and perinatal (possible neonatal sepsis or neonatal sepsis). Twenty three out of 30 patients (76.6%) had a AFVR less than or equal to 5.0 cm. (Oligohydramnios) and seven (30.4%) showed a greater rate than 5.0 cm. The earliest pregnancy was 26.5 weeks and the greatest 34.4 weeks. Out of the total of patients 13 (43.3%) had chorioamnioitis and all correspond to the group with AFVI smaller or equal to 5.0 cm. In the group with oligohydramnios were 15 neonates (65.2%) with neonatal infection (six possible sepsis and nine neonatal sepsis). All neonates with positive cultures also corresponded to the group with smaller AFVR; the comparison among the cases with oligohydramnios with infection and the ones that had normal AFVR without infection has statistical significance (p = 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</dc:description>
