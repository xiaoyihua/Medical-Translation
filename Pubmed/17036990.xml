<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common chronic motor disorder in children and frequently associates sensorial pathology. The objective of our study was to establish the prevalence and characteristics of sensorineural hearing loss in children with CP. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of patients born between the years 1975 and 2004, diagnosed of CP in the "Marqués de Valdecilla" University Hospital. Clinical data were collected including the presence of sensorineural hearing loss, age at diagnosis, treatment and associated pathology. RESULTS Sixty four patients had confirmed CP. Audiological testing had been performed in thirty patients (47%) of them 18 (60%) had sensorineural hearing loss (12 bilateral and 6 unilateral). In thirteen cases hearing loss was associated with mental retardation. The age at diagnosis ranged from 3 months to 7 years (mean 23.2 months). Eight patients were treated with hearing aids and one with a cochlear implant. CONCLUSIONS Sensorineural hearing loss is frequent in CP patients. Management of this problem is difficult in this setting because of the motor disorder and the associated pathology. Early audiological assessment is very important to improve the language outcome in these children.</dc:description>
