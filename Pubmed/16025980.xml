<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Theacute pancreatitis is classified as severe by the presence of glandular necrosis or organic failure. However both conditions are not simultaneous. We determine the frequency of organic failure in patients with pancreatic necrosis for acute pancreatitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS A study retrospective, traverse, descriptive and observational is carried. Were included the cases of pancreatic necrosis by acute pancreatitis presented of January 1 from 1996 to December 31 2000. The presence of organic failure was determined, as well as ages, sex, etiology, nutritional state, Ranson's criteria, surgeries carried and mortality. RESULTS 45% of the patients with necrosis pancreatic development organic failure. The masculine sex and the realization of some surgery predominated in them. 92% of the patients with organic failure presents it to the admission, the system circulatory was the more frequently affected, continued by the respiratory, and the renal. The patients with organic failure had a mortality of 88% against 0% of those that didn't present it. The SIRPA and irreversible shock were the causes of death. DISCUSSION Not is clear the relationship between necrosis and organic failure. The death of pancreatic tissue for apoptosis, that limits the damage and the necrosis, that it favors, is factors to consider. The hypoperfusion tissular can be the determinant among these two lesion forms.</dc:description>
