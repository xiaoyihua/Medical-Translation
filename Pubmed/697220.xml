<dc:description xml:lang="en">Three children with four fusiform venous aneurysms in the neck are described. A correct referral clinical diagnosis had not been established in any of these children. The diagnosis should be made generally on the basis of the physical examination, including the test of the "digital pressure", which is particularly useful to rule out a laringocele. Three of the aneurysms have been treated by surgical removal. Histological examination showed microscopic changes which were related to the time elapsed since the mass was first noticed. Areas of thinning out and sclerosis of the venous wall were evident in one case. The patient with the remaining aneurysm is being followed closely.</dc:description>
