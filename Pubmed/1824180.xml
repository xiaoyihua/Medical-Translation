<dc:description xml:lang="en">71 healthy individuals were vaccinated against hepatitis B virus. Each person received 60 mcgrs of HBsAg derived from chronic carriers heat-formalin treated plasma. All the vaccinees were tested for anti-HBs and 94.4% of them reached the protective titer (greater than 10 mUI/ml). There were few and no significant side effects (15.4%). Those vaccines with antibody titers higher than 100 mUI/ml were significantly younger than those with antibody titers lower than 100 mUI/ml. There was no significant difference between the body surface means of both groups. Thus, the vaccine level response is not associated with the body surface but with people's age.</dc:description>
