<dc:description xml:lang="en">We report the case of a 62-year-old man with a long-standing lesion on the dorsum of his right foot. The patient had diabetes mellitus and was under treatment with oral antidiabetic agents. The lesion contained abundant necrotic tissue, the borders showed evident signs of inflammation, and there was abundant prurulent exudate. Symptoms of infection were observed and a long course of broad-spectum antibiotics was administered. Given the site and characteristics of the lesion, unselective cleansing techniques were avoided. Collagen powder and silver dressing were applied to control bacteria and finally alginate and silicone sponge dressings were applied to soak up the exudate and keep the area moist. After 22 weeks of treatment, evident signs of improvement were observed, allowing the patient to perform activities of daily living.</dc:description>
