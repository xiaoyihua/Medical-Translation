<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Despite world wide circulation of enteroviruses, little information has accumulated on the circulation of enteroviruses in Colombia. OBJECTIVE The prevalence of enterovirus circulation was examined in children under 1 year to identify the most common enterovirus serotypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fecal samples were collected from 320 children under 1 year of age who attended a first-level health center in the city of Armenia, Colombia, in 2009. Enterovirus detection was performed by reverse transcription reaction and nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-N-PCR) using generic enterovirus primers. Samples testing positive in the RT-N-PCR were inoculated into cell cultures susceptible to enterovirus. All isolates were typed by seroneutralization with Lim-Benyesh-Melnick antiserum pools. RESULTS Overall, enteroviral RNA was detected in 43 of 320 (13.3%; 95% CI: 9.7 to 17.1) fecal samples by RT-N-PCR. Viral isolation was possible in 26 of 43 (60.4%) of the positive samples. Of these, 15 were Coxsackievirus B (eight CVB1, two CVB2, five CVB5) and 11 Echovirus (six E6 and five E30). CONCLUSIONS The enteroviral circulation in a population on newly bornes up to 1 year old was 13.3%;the most frequent enterovirus was the same as those serotypes most commonly isolated in other parts of the world. The use of RT-N-PCR was demonstrably feasible as a tool to monitor the presence of enterovirus in stool samples.</dc:description>
