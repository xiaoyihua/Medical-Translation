<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy and safety of interferon alpha therapy for the treatment of infantile periorbital hemangiomas associated with visual impairment. METHODS Retrospective study of 4 patients diagnosed of orbital hemangioma during infancy. All of them were treated with interferon alpha 2b at doses of 3 million U/m2, administered once daily by subcutaneous injection, at least during 3.5 months. The lesions were compared through clinical evaluation and diagnostic imaging (echography, CT and MRI) before, during and after treatment, estimating the percentage of lesion reduction in relation to the initial size. RESULTS In 3 cases, a 95% volume reduction was detected, and greater than 50% in the other one. Spastic diplegia was detected in a child during treatment, but resolved without persistent neurological deficits when discontinued. Alterations in plasmatic lipid profile were detected in one patient. CONCLUSION Interferon alpha can be a valuable treatment for periorbital hemangiomas of infancy; even though, adverse effects can be clinically significant.</dc:description>
