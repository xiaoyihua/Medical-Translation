<dc:description xml:lang="es">Introduction: Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by the consumption of large amounts of food in short time accompanied by a feeling of lack of control over eating. The BED is associated with a little balanced diet, contributing to the development of several pathologies. Food and lifestyle play a key factor in the prevention of these diseases, being the Mediterranean diet (DM) one of the standards of healthy food. Objective: To evaluate the relationship between DM and BED in a sample of university students. Method: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on a sample of 120 students of the University of Alicante. To establish the relationship between the pattern of binge eating and the degree of adherence to the DM correlation coefficient r Pearson was determined. The results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and confidence interval (CI) at 95%. Results: Subjects with a pattern of BED, had lower adherence to the DM (OR = 4.03; 95% CI, 1.80 to 18.69), higher rates of overweight (OR = 5.31, 95% CI, 1.81 to 15.64), and more sedentary lives (OR = 1.4; 95% CI, 0.52 to 4.12). The BED is negatively correlated with the degree of adherence DM (r = -0.3, p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: The pattern of DM is associated inversely with the risk for binge eating disorder and also such a pattern of binge eating is significantly associated with the risk of overweight in university students. They are necessary studies that confirm that the DM reduces the risk for binge eating disorder (AU)</dc:description>
