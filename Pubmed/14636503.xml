<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To evaluate what health-care users know about their own weight, the distribution of body fat and the relationship of their level of knowledge with cardiovascular risk factors. DESIGN Descriptive cross-sectional study.Setting. Urban health centre. PARTICIPANTS 240 patients between 15 and 69, chosen by consecutive sampling. MAIN MEASUREMENTS Survey, analysis (n=100), body measurements and sphygmomanometry were done. RESULTS 80.8% of users knew their weight to over-95% accuracy. The biggest errors were found in older patients and in women. There was great prevalence of male-style obesity (71.3%), even among women. The population with greatest errors in knowing their own weight were at greater cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSIONS In elderly people, age and sex condition the Body Mass Index and their ignorance of their own weight. There is a relationship between this variable and cardiovascular risk factors. This relationship supports the taking of individual-specific health education measures on obesity in primary care.</dc:description>
