MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed patients admitted between 26/06/09 and 08/09/2009 with diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. All patients were conducted laboratory, chest X-ray, blood and nasal swab for viral isolation by polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), beginning treatment with sulbactam ampicillin, clarithromycin, and oseltamivir. RESULTS The number of patients studied was 44 patients, in 14 patients was confirmed the diagnosis of influenza by RT-PCR, the median age was 44 years (range 18 to 81 years) and 9 (64%) were female. The average time between onset of symptoms and medical consultation was 5 days and the average hospital stay was 6 days. CLINICAL SYMPTOMS fever over 38 C, 13 patients (92%), dry cough, 4 patients (28%), productive cough, 9 (64 %), headache and myalgia: 6. Radiological presentation 10 (72 %) patients had bilateral involvement, both bases, and two or more quadrants involved in the chest X-ray. Co morbilities: one patient had heart disease and one patient had COPD. RISK FACTORS 3 patients were alcoholic, 4 patients were smokers, and 2 postpartum.
