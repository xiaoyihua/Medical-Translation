<dc:description xml:lang="en">The official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology (SEM) was first published in 1947, under the name Microbiología Española. Until 1984 the journal was published by the SEM jointly with the Institute &lt;Jaime Ferrán&gt; (from the National Research Council, CSIC). In 1985 SEM started by itself to publish a new journal named Microbiología SEM, which may be considered the continuation of the former. From 1985 on the journal has increased both the quality and variety of its articles. At the beginning, most articles were in Spanish. Gradually, articles in English have been majority, to increase international readership. Currently the journal is published quarterly, with more than 500 pages per year.</dc:description>
