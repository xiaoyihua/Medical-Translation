<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To evaluate the incidence of intraocular pressure (IOP) spikes after contact transscleral diode laser cyclophotocoagulation (cyclodiode) and to identify related risk factors. METHOD Retrospective study of 116 eyes (110 patients) with refractory glaucoma who underwent cyclodiode. IOP measurement was obtained immediately before and one hour after cyclodiode. We defined an IOP spike as an increase equal or superior to 5 mmHg after laser treatment. We evaluated several potential pre-, intra- and post-operative factors related to the IOP spike occurrence. RESULTS Mean IOP decreased one hour after cyclodiode 6.96 mmHg (SD: 8.36) (p&lt;0.001). Overall, we observed 10.8% of IOP spikes. Age, sex, mean energy delivered, pop occurrence and iris colour were not associated with the postoperative IOP spike occurrence. The percentage of IOP spikes was higher in neovascular glaucoma (p=0.074). The IOP spike rate was also higher after retreatment, but the difference compared to the eyes which underwent cyclodiode for the first time was not significant. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results suggest that IOP spike prevention could be considered in neovascular glaucoma scheduled for cyclodiode</dc:description>
