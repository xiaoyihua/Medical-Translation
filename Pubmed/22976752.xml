<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is uncommon, characterized by a heterogeneous mixture of histologic characteristics. OBJECTIVE evaluate clinical and pathological characteristics in a population of patients with MBC in a reference center. MATERIALS AND METHODS retrospective analysis of cases diagnosed with MBC at INCAN database from 2005-2011 was performed. Univariate assessment of clinical variables and their impact on disease free survival(DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. RESULTS the records of 20 patients were identified. Median age was 49.5 (range: 33-75). Clinical stages at diagnosis were 6 I-II (30%) and 14 III-IV (70%). Three year OS was 52.1%. Patients&lt; 40 years had an OS of 32.8 months vs. ≥ 40 years of 17.8 (p = 0.097). OS in stage I-II was 13.5 months vs. 23.3 months in III-IV (p = 0.99). Those who received neoadjuvant therapy had an OS of 26.57 vs. 14.36 in those who did not(p = 0.54). Those who received adjuvant therapy had an OS of 31.2 months vs. 11.15 in those who did not (p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS MBC has bad prognosis, nevertheless, age &lt; 40 years and hormone receptor positivity, as well as adjuvant treatment seems to be factors that have an influence OS.</dc:description>
