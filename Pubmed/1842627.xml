<dc:description xml:lang="en">In cultures of secretions from 101 distal ends of endotracheal tubes removed from patients recently operated on due to several vascular affections, 41.6% of them were positive to different germs: pathogenic (7.9%), potentially pathogenic (12.9%), habitual in the oropharynx (3.9%), opportunistic (4.9%), contaminating (0.9%). Out of the 18.8% of patients recently operated on for acute inflammatory pneumopathy, 68.4% of them had positive cultures of the secretions in the distal ends of the removed endotracheal tubes. Hemocultures were carried out in 34.7% of the patients and 17.1% of them were found positive, although the germs found in the endotracheal tubes and the hemocultures were different. In the immediate postoperative period 48.5% of the gastric pH test were carried out and it was found that 37.6% of them were lower than 4, and 10.9% were higher than 4.1. Among the diseased, 28.6% had acute inflammatory pneumopathy and positive cultures of the secretions in the endotracheal tubes removed.</dc:description>
