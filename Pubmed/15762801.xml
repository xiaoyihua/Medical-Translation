<dc:description xml:lang="en">The histoplasmosis in Spain is an imported disease presenting in most of case diagnostic difficulties. In this paper, the intradermal skin test with Histoplasma capsulatum antigen as diagnostic method in immunocompetent patients with clinical and radiological signs compatible with histoplasmosis after being visited Central and South American endemic counties, in which this mycosis is endemic. Nine Spanish patients coming from different countries of Latin America with fever and acute respiratory symptoms compatible with histoplasmosis were studied. Other nine accompanying subjects and five controls were also evaluated. Patients underwent mycological cultures and and serological tests for H. capsulatum. Intradermal test with 1% histoplasmine were done in all patients. Serology and skin tests tests were also performed in accompanying people. Intradermal were done in healthy controls. Skin test with histoplasmine were positive in seven of the nine patients. Six of these showed precipitating antibodies against the same antigen. H. capsulatum was only isolated from bone marrow biopsy samples in one patient. The seven patients were given itraconazole by oral route and all symptoms improved after 2 and 4 weeks. In five accompanying subjects the skin test were also positive so that a subclinical histoplasmosis was diagnosed. In the remaining patients and healthy accompanying subjects histoplasmosis infection was excluded. In non endemic geographical areas of histoplasmosis intradermal skin test with histoplasmin when used in immunocompetent individuals is an easy and reliable method for the diagnosis of this mycosis as well as for epidemiological studies.</dc:description>
