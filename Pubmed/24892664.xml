<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Determining the effect of a prescribed unsupervised exercise and counseling program on the physical activity and fitness levels of university students volunteering for an emergency response brigade. METHODOLOGY Forty-two brigade volunteers engaged in a 12-week prescribed non-supervised exercise program. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, waist circumference, oxygen consumption, flexibility and arms and abdomen strength endurance were assessed before and after performing the exercise program. The other variables measured concerned the level of physical activity during leisure time (days and minutes per week) and/or the use of alternative means of transport. Exercise was prescribed according to international standards. The activities, commitment and health-nutritional recommendations were controlled every two weeks. RESULTS The study reported a statistically significant increase regarding the following variables: O2 consumption (from 46.41 ± 6.65 ml/Kg/min to 47.70 ± 6.27 ml/Kg/min; p&lt;0.01), increased arm strength endurance (from 11.82 ± 9.97 to 14.74 ± 12.74 repetitions; p&lt;0.01) and an increase in the number of abdominal exercises (crunches) (from 21.16 ± 11.91 to 26.64 ± 17.03 repeats; p&lt;0.01). The real accomplishment regarding commitment by the time of the second measurement concerned 2.54 ± 2.07 days/week and 144.16 ± 238.89 minutes/week of physical activity. These levels were significantly lower than those established at the beginning of the program (4 ± 1.05 days/week and 239.52 ± 73.01 minutes/week; p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS The prescribed unsupervised exercise and counseling program led to increases in oxygen consumption, arm strength endurance and the number of repeat abdominal crunches. Real fulfilment of the proposed activities was lower than planned original commitment.</dc:description>
