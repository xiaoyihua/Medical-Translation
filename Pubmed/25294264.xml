<dc:description xml:lang="en">A lot of data were reported about monitoring patients with inflammatory bowel disease, with varying degrees of practical applicability. Concerning the evaluation of disease activity, it was established that objective assessments are needed. Among the techniques that we use, although endoscopy is undoubtedly the reference standard, a lot of data were presented regarding less invasive techniques. The importance of MRIs, CTs and ultrasounds (with some variations) was thus reiterated. The importance of fecal calprotectin is also reiterated, not only for colon disease, but probably small intestine disease as well. Regarding treatment monitoring, a great deal was reported about anti-TNF therapy, demonstrating again its potential role when properly used. In addition to results with infliximab, results with adalimumab were reported as very consistent. For colon cancer prevention, it seems that the clinical guidelines are achieving their objective. It also seems clear that we must improve conventional endoscopic techniques. Finally, there are other aspects that need to be considered when monitoring our patients, such as adequate sleeping patterns, anxiety or depression.</dc:description>
