<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Thoracoscopic treatment of esophageal atresia type 3 has been previously reported to be feasible but no study clearly showed the benefits of thoracoscopy compared to open procedure. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of esophageal atresia type III treated by thoracoscopic or open procedure. MATERIAL AND METHOD From january 2000 to december 2006, 31 children were operated, 17 by thoracotomy (weight range from 1750 to 4020 g) and 14 by thoracoscopy (weight range from 2110 to 4160 g). Neonatal deaths from an independent condition (3 cases in thoracotomy group) were excluded from the study and we analyzed 14 children in each group. Analyzed data included length of surgery, length of post operative assisted ventilation, length of pleural drainage, length of stay in ICU, delay before oral feeding, length of morphine analgesia, length of hospitalization and rate of complication. RESULTS Length of morphine analgesia was higher in thoracotomy group than in thoracoscopic group (mean 6.6 days versus 5.3 days, p = 0.16). Length of hospitalization was also higher in thoracotomy group (mean 22.6 days versus 19.1 days, p = 0.3). The rate of complication with thoracoscopy was not higher need of oesophageal dilatation (21% in thoracoscopic group versus 14% in thoracotomy group), need of Nissen fundoplication (21% in thoracoscopic group versus 28% in thoracotomy group). CONCLUSION Thoracoscopic treatment of esophageal atresia type III reduces the need of morphine analgesia and the length of stay without increasing the risk of postoperative complications.</dc:description>
