<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Levofloxacin, an antibiotic from the quinolone family, which is used with success in the ambulatory treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, has been recently introduced to the pharmaceutical market. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and tolerance of oral (v.o.) levofloxacin (LVF) versus intravenous (i.v.) amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMX/CL) and ceftriaxone (CTX) in the treatment of the community-acquired pneumonia that require hospitalization (CAPH). PATIENTS AND METHOD In this prospective and randomized study 84 patients were included, 28 per group, from both sex with CAPH. The patients were assigned randomly to receive one of the next treatments: AMX/CL, 1.02 g i.v. every 8 h, CTX, 1 g i.v. every 12 h or LVF, 500 mg v.o. every 24 h. At the beginning clinical, biochemical and radiological characteristics were recorded from each case and at the 72 h the effect of treatment was evaluated using the evolution of the thermal curve and radiological images. The quantitative variables were analyzed with ANOVA, the qualitatives parameters with *2 test and Yates correction. The level of signification was * = 0.05. RESULTS Age, sex, clinical presentation, biochemical measurements and radiological images in the 3 groups were similar and no adverse effects were recorded in any of them. Number of patients with favorable outcome in the groups AMX/CL, CTX and LVF was 25 (89%), 25 (89%) and 26 (93%); p = 0,870. CONCLUSIONS Levofloxacin can be a simple, effective and safe therapeutic option for patients with CAPH.</dc:description>
