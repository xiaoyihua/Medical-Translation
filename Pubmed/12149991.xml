<dc:description xml:lang="en">UNLABELLED The authors determine whether or not nurses should use perfusion pumps for concentrated hematin transfusions, measuring the degree of hemolysis which occurs in two distinct models. STUDY SAMPLE Concentrated hematin transfusions by means of an infusion pump on children in a Pediatrics Intensive Care Unit at the Maternity-Pediatrics Ward in Granada. Dependent Variable: Degree of Hemolysis, measured by means of: free hemoglobin, potassium, LDH. INDEPENDENT VARIABLES Pump; dated/used blood; hematocrit; catheter caliber; type of procedure; pump working pressure; other perfusion rhythms; infusion rhythm. Sample size. One year study group, 95% confidence rate, 0.50 prevalence of awaited hemolysis, +/- 0.05 precision (relative precision 10%). Data Obtained: Two samples are taken per transfusion: removal of blood bag, extreme distal removal system. Investigative Method: Prospective descriptive study. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive statistics, by means of frequency distributions. Variable analysis, multiple variable analysis. RESULTS 55 observations were carried, of these, 50.9% corresponded to pump number one. Simple regression linear analysis showed differences in the degree of hemolysis in terms of free hemoglobin and hematocrit. Dated/used blood registered a higher hemolysis level above 75 percentile. The greater hemolysis in terms of potassium difference was associated with the type of procedure, having an average of 0.44 mEq/l, in presence of other perfusions, greater rhythm (p = 0.118), dated/used blood (p = 0.008), hematocrit (p = 0.063). The greatest difference in LDH occurred with smaller caliber catheters, other perfusions, more dated blood (p = 0.117). In multiple linear regression, results were equal to those predicted: an average difference in hemoglobin of 3.87 mg/l (p = 0.661); in potassium, 0.39 mEq/l (p = 0.138); in LDH, 53.6 (p = 0.568).
