<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The management of quality is a key tool to improve efficacy of Spanish hospitals. Hospital quality programs and those of each department/unit are based on self-evaluation with the principle of there being things to be improved and have demonstrated their efficacy. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the applicability of the methodology of quality in a Department of Clinical Documentation. METHODS Four indicators of quality in the quality program were measured in the form of indexes over 18 months in a department of clinical documentation of a general hospital. RESULTS Index of filing errors: 0.1%, index of history availability: 98%, index of histories not in place: 6.4 to 11.1, index of reclaimable histories: 3.1 to 5.2. CONCLUSIONS The methodology of quality is applicable to a department of clinical documentation with its development being useful in detecting problems as the first step in improving quality.</dc:description>
