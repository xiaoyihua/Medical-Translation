<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Interleukin-10 (IL-10) has a key role in regulating mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease. In our population of Spanish ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, we have previously demonstrated that two polymorphisms (IL-10.G14 microsatellite allele and homozygous for the -1082G allele (guanine at position -1082)) in the IL-10 gene were susceptibility markers for disease. No data exist regarding the relationship of these IL-10 polymorphisms with phenotypic subpopulations in UC. Therefore, this study sought to examine the contribution of IL-10 polymorphisms to phenotypical variability in UC. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cohort of 215 Spanish unrelated patients with UC recruited in a single center was studied. All patients were rigorously phenotyped and followed for at least 3 years (mean time: 11.8 years). The clinical phenotype was established before genotyping. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. RESULTS Patients with UC included 129 (60%) men and 89 (40%) women. Mean age at diagnosis was 38 years, with a range of 8-83. Disease extent included 127 (59.1%) left-side patients and 88 (40.9%) extensive patients. Neither UC phenotype variable was associated with the presence of susceptibility polymorphisms (10G14 microsatellite and -1082G allele). CONCLUSIONS In Madrid's Spanish population of UC patients, the carrying of the ILG14 microsatellite or -1082G polymorphism in the IL-10 gene was not associated with phenotype of disease.</dc:description>
