<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The aim of the present was to study the cytohistology of the bone marrow in intravenous drug addicts (IVDA) and to analyze the possible differences according to the period of drug addiction. METHODS A prospective study was performed in 60 IVDA patients previously untreated and distributed into three groups: 20 seronegative for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 20 patients in a phase of generalized adenopathic infection (GAI) and 20 patients with AIDS. RESULTS Cytohistologic examination of the bone marrow aspirates showed plasmocytosis and eosinophilia in all the groups. Selective changes were seen in the red series in 20% of the HIV negative patients and in 25% of the GAI group. The prevalence of cytologic changes was greater in those with AIDS, with hypocellular bone marrow being observed in 65% of the patients with coexistent dismyelopoietic changes in 15%. Pathologic structure showed granulomatous lesions of tuberculous etiology in 30% of the patients with AIDS while in the HIV negative and GAI groups these were found in 10% and 5%, respectively. A greater presence of fibrosis and bone marrow hypoplasia was also found in the group with AIDS, than in the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS An increased number of bone marrow changes and progressive bone marrow hypocellularity may be observed on advancement of the clinical stages in intravenous drug addict patients. The incidence of tuberculous granulomas is higher in the AIDS group.</dc:description>
