<dc:description xml:lang="en">The most common malignancy of the oral cavity is epidermoid or squamous cell carcinoma, which accounts for approximately 5% of all neoplasms. Unfortunately, the great majority of these tumors are diagnosed in stages which require surgery with radio- and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy constitutes an important option in the treatment of oral tumors, and can be applied either alone or in combination with surgery and chemotherapy. The latter has no precisely defined role in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas, and is usually used as a coadjuvant therapy or for palliative purposes. Since these treatments affect not only the malignant cells but also the healthy tissues of the patient, side effects usually develop during and after treatment, in the form of oral lesions and systemic alterations. Examples include mucositis, xerostomia, immune suppression, and viral and fungal infections, among other problems. The present study offers a management protocol for the oncological patient before, during and after radio- and chemotherapy. In addition, emphasis is placed on the important role of the dental professional in the prevention and treatment of the main oral complications, proposing dental management guidelines which are applicable in the general clinical context.</dc:description>
