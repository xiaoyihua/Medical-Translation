<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION We present a non-randomised comparative study of two patients series followed up prospectively, in which convention laparoscopic cholecystectomy is compared with transvaginal cholecystectomy, a hybrid transluminal endoscopic procedure, with the objective of assessing the clinical safety of the procedures and its efficacy in the resolution of cholelithiasis. PATIENTS AND METHOD A non-randomised prospective clinical series of 40 female patients, operated on for cholelithiasis using endoscopic surgery, 20 with a conventional laparoscopic approach and 20 using a transvaginal endoscopic approach. Surgical wound infection, urinary infection, evisceration, eventration, mortality and other complications. RESULTS Scheduled operations were performed on the 40 patients as indicated. There were no complications during the operations. There was no mortality associated with the procedures and there was only one post-surgical complication, a urinary tract infection in one patient operated on by the transvaginal approach. The mean follow up was the same in both groups (9 months). The mean hospital stay was less than 0.8 days in both groups. The duration of the surgery was longer in the transvaginal approach group, with a mean of 69.5 min, compared to 46.2 min in the laparoscopy group. CONCLUSIONS Although the cosmetic benefit is obvious, no differences were found as regards parietal problems in this series. The duration of the transvaginal surgery is higher than that of the transparietal, but the times of both are acceptable. In this study, the non-inferiority in the safety and efficacy of the transvaginal approach is able to be assessed.</dc:description>
