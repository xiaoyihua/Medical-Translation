<dc:description xml:lang="en">After more than 10,000 cases reported all over the world until 1998, simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplantation has become a safe clinical practice, and it may probably represent the best treatment available for diabetic patients in end-stage renal disease. Here we present our results after 12 cadaveric pancreas transplants (8 whole organ, and 4 islet transplants), performed on insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Eleven of these patients received a kidney simultaneously, and one of them required a kidney retransplantation. All vascularised pancreatic grafts were positioned intraperitoneally, anastomosed to the iliac vessels, and bladder drained. One year patient, whole pancreas, and kidney survival rates were 86%, 86% and 71%, respectively. All of these patients remain insulin and dialysis-free, the longest for 37 months. Islets for transplantation were obtained from single cadaveric donors. Fresh, unpurified cells were transplanted intraperitoneally by laparoscopy (equivalent islet yields: 3 x 10(5), 4 x 10(5), 1 x 10(6) and 5 x 10(5)). None of the islet recipients resulted insulin-independent but they all reduced daily requirements in about 40%, with better metabolic control (mean HbA1c pretransplant 9.4 +/- 1.8, vs 7.9 +/- 1.6 posttransplant). One kidney graft was lost due to venous thrombosis. Simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplantation offers the diabetic patient in end-stage renal disease a chance of independence both from dialysis and exogenous insulin. Whole pancreas transplantation has better functional outcome than islet transplantation. Nevertheless, for those diabetic patients who do not meet the criteria to receive a vascularised graft, pancreatic cells may still improve carbohydrate metabolism with minor surgical risk.</dc:description>
