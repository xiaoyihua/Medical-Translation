<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE A brief revision of the history of the prostate biopsy is done, and emphasis is made in the importance of seek deeply in the diagnostic of small lesions, PIN and atypical prostate hyperplasia. METHODS A total of 221 patients, are presented. A description of the two groups of patients is made. group I with 148 patients in which the sextant type was performed, and the group II, in which our technique of 12 cores was done, using separated bottles for each core. The complete technique used is described and we used the "T" and Rank Sum Test for the statistical analysis of the results. RESULTS We found a global 22.9% positive biopsies in the group I. This grew up as we took out more cores, with 25.9% with more than six cores. The global result in group II was 37.1% of positive biopsies (p = 0.03). There were 25 patients with 12 cores, and the rate of positive was 34.2%. Tumor in one core was found in eight patients and also in two to four cores, in the group of ten cores tumor was found in ten patients. No side effects were reported. DISCUSSION We review the results, and emphasis was made in the necessity of have multiple cores biopsies of the prostate, studying them separate. CONCLUSION Multi-core biopsy of the prostate is a very useful procedure in the diagnosis of cancer of the prostate with better specificity results, statistically significative, and without side effects.</dc:description>
