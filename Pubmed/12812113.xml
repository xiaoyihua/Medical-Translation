<dc:description xml:lang="en">The recognition, identification and management of the many events taking place in relation to an inflammatory response has become a rapidly growing field in medicine over the last few years. In this sense, the progress made in later years in the study of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of tissue inflammatory reactions in sites such as synovial membranes, gut mucosa, vascular endothelium etc, is considered highly relevant. A number of authors conscious of such events work on the standardization of clinical models of the inflammatory responses of genitourinary organs resulting from the action of a variety of harmful events. This review is warranted by the prevalence and morbidity and mortality of inflammatory conditions, as well as the complex work of incorporating to Urology the findings from other Biomedical Sciences.</dc:description>
