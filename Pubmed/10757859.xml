<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Assessment of the prevalence of smoking habits, environmental tobacco exposure, and asthma-related symptoms in a cross-sectional study in schoolchildren aged 14-15 years in Terrassa (Barcelona). METHODS A sample of 793 students from 21 schools answered a self-administered questionnaire including information on smoking habits, environmental tobacco exposure and asthma-related symptoms. RESULTS The prevalence of smoking daily was 16.3% (CI 13. 7-18.9); no difference between sexes were observed, while the proportion of occasional smokers was higher among girls. Age, maternal habit, friend's smoking habit and having older siblings were independently associated to the schoolchildren's smoking habits. Overall, 13% reported a positive history of wheezing and 20.3% of nocturnal cough during the previous year. Smoking daily and passive smoking were positively associated with the prevalence of asthma-related symptoms, but not with previous diagnosis of asthma. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of smoking among adolescents seems to have levelled off. There is some trend toward a higher prevalence among girls than among boys. The presence of smoking in the social environment is a strong predictor of the smoking habits among schoolchildren. Both active smoking and environmental exposure to tobacco smoke are associated to increased asthma-related symptoms.</dc:description>
