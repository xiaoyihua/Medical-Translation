<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The endocannabinoid system consists of cannabinoid receptors, endogenous ligands and the enzymatic elements involved in their synthesis and breakdown. AIM To report on currently held knowledge about the functioning of the system as a modulator of the neuroinflammatory processes associated with chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis. DEVELOPMENT Cannabinoids are synthesised and released on demand and their production increases in times of neuroinflammation and neural damage. In this context then, their actions in the microglial cells and in the astrocytes are characterised by a lowered expression of inflammatory mediators and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, cannabinoids can play a role as neuroprotectors by means of different types of mechanisms and, in experimental models of multiple sclerosis, they slow down the symptoms, reduce inflammation and can favour remyelination. CONCLUSIONS The clinical use of cannabinoids or pharmacological agents that affect the endogenous cannabinoid system during inflammation of the central nervous system and in multiple sclerosis is currently under consideration and subject to debate. Detailed analysis of the results obtained over the past decade has made it possible to establish the existence of several mechanisms of action of cannabinoids in pathologies affecting the central nervous system that are accompanied by chronic inflammation. Likewise, they also clearly show that the cannabinoid system is an interesting proposal as a new therapeutic tool.</dc:description>
