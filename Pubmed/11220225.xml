<dc:description xml:lang="en">The monthly species composition and the spatial and temporal variation of fish community of Laguna Grande de Obispo, Gulf of Canaco, Sucre State, Venezuela were analyzed. The samples were collected using two beach seines of different size from December 1995 to November 1996. A cluster analysis for stations inside the lagoon and time of capture showed 4 major groups, defined principally with ecological parameters of each area. Fishing with large seine in and outside the lagoon showed two large groups which were divided into 10 subgroups in function of station and time, while an inverse analysis of the same sample differentiated into 8 groups of species. based on distribution, dominance, and occurrence. Xenomeianiris brasiliensis, Mugil curema and Eucinostomus argenteus were the most abundant species in both time and space. An analysis of conglomerate on the whole fish community of the sampling period indicated the existence of two groups: i) the first half of the year including December 1995 and October 1996 and ii) the second half of the year. The distribution of fishes in relation to ecological factors is discussed.</dc:description>
