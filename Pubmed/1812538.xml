<dc:description xml:lang="en">Serum/salivary testosterone ratio (ST/SlvT) expresses the relationship in absolute values between bound and unbound testosterone. This ST/SlvT ratio in supposedly healthy men (n = 25) and women (n = 72) and in patients with several disorders, prostatic carcinoma (n = 19), varicocele (n = 9) and hirsute women (n = 16), has been studied. Both serum and salivary testosterone were measured by an RIA method. ST/SlvT ratio values found in healthy men (78.4 +/- 30.9) did not differ significantly from values found in the varicocele group (111.1 +/- 49.3), but a significant difference (p less than 0.001) from those found in men with prostatic carcinoma (12.3 +/- 7.2) was observed. When the ST/SlvT ratio values obtained in healthy women (18.1 +/- 7.3) were compared with those obtained in hirsute women (1.56 +/- 5.7) no significant differences were observed. The results obtained may indicate the dissociation among the hormone transport, testosterone metabolic clearance and hormone secretion by the salivary glands.</dc:description>
