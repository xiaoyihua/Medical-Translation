<dc:description xml:lang="en">The aim of this study was to examine the link between psychosocial adjustment, impulsivity and comorbid Axis II psychopathology, and the risk of treatment dropout in cocaine dependent patients. The sample consisted of 95 cocaine dependent participants, 53.7% of whom had been diagnosed with Axis II personality disorders. We utilised a descriptive methodology, which allowed us to examine correlations between the different variables, group differences in these variables, and their ability to predict different dimensions associated with the risk of dropout. Results show that the risk of dropout during the first two months of treatment is not associated with the existence of comorbid personality disorders. With regard to the cognitive profiles of personality disorders, we show that the antisocial profile is associated with higher risk of dropout. The profile of patients at higher risk of treatment dropout is characterised by lower levels of perceived quality of life and elevated levels of impulsivity, especially the experience of strong impulses under positive affect. Therefore, the presence of psychological dimensions tightly associated with emotions, affects and subjective feelings are the more relevant to estimate the risk of treatment dropout in cocaine dependent patients. This study stresses the variables that need to be specifically addressed during early phases of cocaine addiction treatment, since they are associated with higher risk of treatment dropout.</dc:description>
