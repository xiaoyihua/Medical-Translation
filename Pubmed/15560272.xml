<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION The description of the first laparoscopic nephrectomy made a revolution in the managing of the benign and malignant renal diseases. Hand-assisted laparoscopy (HAL) was developed with the aim of offering advantages to both patients and surgeons. The aim of the present work is to compare, in our experience, the results offered in the radical nephrectomy by HAL and open surgery, by analysis of surgical time, estimated blood loss during surgery and hospital stay. METHODS Eleven Hand-assisted laparoscopic (HAL) radical nephrectomies and eight open radical nephrectomies were carried out at our institution during the same period (June 2001 to December 2002). All patients underwent computed tomography and were found to have a clinically localised functioning renal mass in all cases. The size of this renal mass was 4-7 cm (average 5.5 cm) in the HAL group and 4.5-15 cm (average 7.8 cm) in the open group. Patient age, body mass index, and American Society of Anaesthesiologists' score showed no significant difference between groups. RESULTS The average surgical time in the HAL group was 156.72 minutes, the average blood loss during surgery was of 83.6 ml and the average hospital stay was of 3.09 days. Conversion to open surgery was not necessary in any patient. Average surgical time in the open surgery group was 178.25 minutes, the estimated blood loss during surgery was of 337.75 ml (p &lt; 0.05) and the hospital stay was of 5.37 days (p &lt; 0.05). The comparison of the means by two-tailed student's t test revealed significant differences in estimated blood loss and hospital stay, favoring HAL, and no significant differences in surgical time. CONCLUSIONS HAL nephrectomy is feasible in almost all nephrectomies and is a safe, reproducible, and minimally invasive technique to perform extirpable renal surgery. HAL offer clear advantages over traditional open surgery, including decreased blood loss and hospital stay.</dc:description>
