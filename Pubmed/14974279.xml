<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical and sexual lifestyle characteristics associated with Chlamydia trachomatis infection among women diagnosed with infertility. MATERIAL AND METHODS Study subjects were women with an infertility diagnosis attending the infertility clinic at the National Institute of Perinatology. Endocervical specimens from 309 women were examined for Chlamydia trachomatis using the direct immunofluorescence method. Vaginal culture samples were taken before initiating treatment. The presence of other sexually-transmitted infections was also assessed. Demographic, sexual behavioral, historical, and clinical data were collected for each subject. RESULTS Seventy-seven women (24.9%) were infected with C trachomatis. Of these women, 70 (90.9%) had only one sexual partner, 58 (75.3%) were married, and 19 (24.7%) were single or had a common-law sex partner. Intrauterine device (IUD) was the main contraceptive method used in 15 women (19.5%). A coinfection with other sexually-transmitted microorganisms was detected in 41 of these patients (53.2%). Nineteen (24.7%) women had undergone tubal ligation. Among women with C trachomatis infection, reproductive sequelae were found: 24 (31.2%) women had had abortions and 50 (64.9%) had had a miscarriage. In 26 women cervical abnormalities were detected (33.8%); 50 (64.9%) had purulent vaginal discharge and 14 (18.1%) had pelvic pain. Bivariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for C trachomatis infection in women with infertility were: having a sex partner (OR = 2.96, 95% CI 1.22-7.5, p = 0.008), common-law union (OR = 3.68, p = 0.03), and IUD use (OR = 2.42, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS A consistent relationship between C trachomatis infection and infertility was found. Infection with C trachomatis in women with infertility was associated with having one single sexual partner, marital status, and IUD use. The presence of ectropion and friability of the cervix may signal C trachomatis infection. Identification and presumptive therapy should be evaluated as measures to prevent and control C trachomatis infection in patients at risk.
