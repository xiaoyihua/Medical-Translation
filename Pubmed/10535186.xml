<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND To evaluate clinical and microbiological characteristics of sepsis due to Corynebacterium amycolatum, because few cases have been reported in human infections by this bacteria. METHODS We report two cases of sepsis due to Corynebacterium amycolatum, the patients were diagnosed as having leukaemia. The identification procedures are discussed. RESULTS We describe 2 patients with sepsis in neutropenic phase. Antibiotic treatment was successful in both cases. Clinical isolates were classified as Corynebacterium xerosis by the Api Coryne system Version 1.0. The chemotaxonomic characteristics of the isolates were determined by thin-layer chromatographic analysis. Isolates did not contain mycolic acids, they were identified as Corynebacterium amycolatum. CONCLUSIONS Sepsis due to Corynebacterium amycolatum is a rare disorder. A test for mycolic acid could be sufficient to make a distinction between Corynebacterium amycolatum and other diphteroid bacteria. Such a test involves thin-layer chromatography.</dc:description>
