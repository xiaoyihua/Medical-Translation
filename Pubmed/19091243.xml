<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To assess survival and predictive factors of mortality after an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients and to analyze the diagnostic and therapeutic measures used. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 158 consecutive episodes of SBP treated between January 2003 and December 2005. Survival was studied by Kaplan-Meier curves, compared by the log-rank test. Independent predictive factors of mortality were obtained by a Cox regression model, while independent predictive factors of in-hospital mortality were obtained by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 80.4% of the SBP episodes occurred in men and the mean age was 61.23 +/- 12.49 years. The most frequent etiology of cirrhosis was viral (51.3%), followed by alcoholic (39.9%). The distribution of Child-Pugh classification was 5.7% (A), 63.3% (B) and 31% (C). Overall 3-year survival in the sample was 43.3%. Four variables were identified as independent predictive factors of in-hospital and 3-month mortality: renal impairment, hepatic encephalopathy, diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) &lt; 75 mmHg. At the end of the monitoring period, the results of the analysis were as follows: diagnosis of HCC, MAP &lt; 75 mmHg, and age &gt; 65 years. Microbiological detection was achieved in 21% of the episodes. The most frequent microorganisms detected were Escherichia coli in ascitic fluid and Staphylococcus aureus in blood cultures. CONCLUSIONS SBP has a poor short- and long-term prognosis in cirrhotic patients. Independent predictive factors of short-term survival are renal impairment, hepatic encephalopathy, MAP &lt; 75 mmHg, and the presence of HCC.</dc:description>
