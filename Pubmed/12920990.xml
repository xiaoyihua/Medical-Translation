<dc:description xml:lang="en">In Instituto de Cardiología y Cirugía Cardiovascular, Fundación Favaloro, between January 1996 and October 1999, 10,793 blood cultures and 942 episodes of bacteremia, corresponding to 1883 positive blood cultures, were studied by means of the Bact-Alert System (Organon Teknika), 94% being monomicrobial episodes. Gram positive bacteria were isolated in 45%, Gram negative in 52% and fungi in 3% of episodes. Associated foci of infection were: catheters 36.5%, mediastinitis 9%, pneumonia 6%, endocarditis 6%, abdominal 6%, urinary tract infections 9%, prosthesis 2.6%, empyema 0.2%, arthritis 0.1%, skin and soft tissue 2.5%, diarrhea 0.1%, aortic aneurysm 0.2%, meningitis 0.2%, pericarditis 0.3%, endarteritis 0.1%, infusion fluids 0.2% and unknown 21%. Median time (in hours) for positivization of blood cultures according to different foci were: catheters 16.4, mediastinitis 19.2, pneumonia 14.2, endocarditis 14.5, abdominal infections 11.8, urinary tract infections 13.0 and unknown origin 19.0. As for contaminating microorganisms, the value was 30.5. Seventy two percent of blood cultures became positive within 24 h, and 87% within 48 h; only 1% became positive between 5th and 7th day. There were no important differences in time to detect positive cultures according to different foci. It was not useful to incubate blood cultures more than five days, except for special circumstances, because it does not improve recovery of clinically significant microorganisms.</dc:description>
