<dc:description xml:lang="en">Twenty one adult patients, both males and females, with 32 bacterial infections of several localizations and moderate to severe prognosis were treated with ciprofloxacin (200 mg every 12 hours), initially intravenously and then with 500 mg every 12 hours orally during 25 +/- 11 days. At the end of the evolution period it was found that 28 infections (87.5%) were cured in 24 of the 28 patients (85.7%), in three patients there was a definite clinical improvement and the treatment failed in the remaining patient. Adverse reactions were suspected in 2 patients, but their relation with the administration of ciprofloxacin was considered to be remote. In 3 patients mild leukopenia without clinical relevance was detected.</dc:description>
