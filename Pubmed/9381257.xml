<dc:description xml:lang="en">PURPOSE To compare the clinical patterns and survival of young and adult (AP) versus paediatric (PP) patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). PATIENTS AND METHODS The clinical records of 117 patients (82% AP, 18% PP) seen in four cities of the Mexican Republic were analysed, the clinical course and survival of both groups being compared. RESULTS No sex difference was found in the two patient-groups: 51% and 52% males, 49% and 48% females in AP and PP, respectively. The onset of PNH had similar distribution for the two groups of patients: aplastic form, 45% in AP and 62% in PP; cytopenias, 24% in AP versus 27% in PP; haemolysis, 28% in AP and 9% in PP, and thrombosis, 3% in AP versus 0% in PP. The clinical features with significant difference were: anaemic+haemorrhagic syndrome (39 AP (40%) vs 14 PP (67%), p = 0.02), initial diagnosis of immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura (7 AP (7%) vs 7 PP (33%), p = 0.003), and death rate (17 AP (18%) vs 8 PP (38%), p = 0.04). The actuarial survival curves showed significant differences between both groups (p = 0.045, Cox-Mantel), with estimated 10-year survival of 81% for AP and 55% for PP, and 15-year survivals of 64% for AP and 55% for PP. CONCLUSIONS Seemingly, PNH in paediatric age has poorer prognosis than in adults, which is associated to higher incidence of fatal haemorrhages due to thrombocytopenia.</dc:description>
