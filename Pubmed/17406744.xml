<dc:description xml:lang="en">The new laws of the health reform in Chile, modified the pre-existent relationship between teaching and health care activities. This relationship allows the training of health care professionals by Universities, in the clinical services of the National System of Health Services that is dependent of the Ministry of Health. The new law established new requirements for specialization and quality of care accreditation. Up to the moment, the relationship between Health Care Services and the Universities was based on harmonic and consensual agreements between both counterparts. With the new law, such relationship becomes more relative and is based on new norms. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to establish a regulated and equilibrated relationship between both institutions, to assure the best possible training of health care professionals, in terms of skills and competences, to adequately satisfy the health needs of the population.</dc:description>
