<dc:description xml:lang="en">Baby walkers are a potential cause of accidents in infants from 6 months to 1 year of age. We conducted a study to determine the patterns of walker use, the different points of view of the parents and the baby walker-related injuries in our health district. For this purpose, between November 1, 1992 and January 31, 1993, a questionnaire was given to 207 parents of infants between the ages of 3 and 24 months in order to evaluate the socioeconomic situation and to determine the patterns of walker use. We found that 42% of the infants between 4.3 and 13.4 months of age had a baby walker and 46.7% of them used it daily. There was a significant inverse relationship between the walker usage and the maternal level of education. Of the infants who used walkers, 24.9% had experienced an accident (falls 76.2%, injuries 14.3% and hospital admission 4.8%). The accidents were significantly more common in boys. The advantages reported by parents (for using walkers) were: 46.3% none, 34.2% comfort, 10.9% infant amusement, 12.9% help to walk earlier. Dangers reported by the parents included: 27.2% none, 33.5% leg deformities, 43% accidents (33.5% injuries and 12% falling down stairs). In conclusion, our results show a slightly lower number of walker users and walker related accidents when compared to other reports. Parents have mistaken notions about the use of baby walkers. Hence, the need for continued health education campaigns related to this subject remain.</dc:description>
