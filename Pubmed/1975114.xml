<dc:description xml:lang="en">Our study has been made on a retrospective basis in order to evaluate the efficacy of somatostatin (SST) in the treatment of acute haemorrhage caused by gastroduodenal ulcer. Sixty patients were allocated in 2 groups: those who received SST (n = 30), and those who did not received it (n = 30), and were treated only with conventional measures (nasogastric catheter, H2 blockers, blood or derivatives, etc.). Both groups were monitored and controlled at the Anesthesia-Intensive Care Unit. The patients in the SST group received a continuous intravenous infusion of 250 micrograms/h. These patients showed better hemodynamic parameters, and only seven needed surgery. The patients in the conventional treatment group showed worse hemodynamics, needed higher volumes of hemoderivatives, and 25 of them needed surgery. The statistical analysis of our data supports the efficacy of SST in the treatment of uncontrollable upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to gastroduodenal ulcer.</dc:description>
