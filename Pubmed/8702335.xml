<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES An experimental study was conducted in the rat to demonstrate the utility of fibrin adhesive in renal parenchymal lesions and the enhanced anatomopathological results achieved in comparison with suturing. METHODS 10 Wistar rats were utilized in the study. The animals were anesthetized with Ketolard, diazepam and atropine. A transverse lesion was made in the left kidney and five different treatments were used. Thereafter nephrectomy was performed on day 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21. Anatomopathological studies of the rat kidneys were done and the results were analyzed using Friedman's variance test. RESULTS Anatomopathological analyses showed a progressive resorption of the fibrin adhesive, which disappeared at two weeks, and a better outcome for the lesions treated by gluing than by suturing. CONCLUSIONS Fibrin adhesive is effective for hemostasis and can be used safely. It is an excellent watertight sealant that causes minimal inflammatory tissue reaction. It is a valid alternative to renal parenchymal suturing and can be used alone or in combination with conventional suturing to reduce the number of sutures and consequently the degree of renal trauma.</dc:description>
