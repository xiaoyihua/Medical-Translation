<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES Propofol is a short-acting, hypnotic agent that is increasingly being used for gastrointestinal endoscopic sedation. There are concerns about the use of propofol by non anesthesiologists due to its potential for respiratory and cardiovascular depression. This report describes our experience concerning effectiveness and safety of propofol administered in endoscopic procedures by the endoscopist and the assistant nurse. METHODS In this prospective study, a total of 102 consecutive endoscopies (60 colonoscopies and 42 upper endoscopies) performed under sedation with propofol were included. In 27 (26.47%) endoscopies propofol was administered alone and in 75 endoscopies (73.53%) it was combined with benzodiazepines and/or opioids. Seventy-six (74.51%) endoscopies were performed in patients under 65 years of age and 26 (25.49%) in patients over 65 years of age. Ninety-one (89.22%) endoscopies were performed in patients with low surgical risk (ASA I-II) and 11 (10.78%) in patients with high surgical risk. The medication was administered by the endoscopist that performed the procedure and the assistant nurse. RESULTS The mean dose of propofol used was 72.14 mg for gastroscopies and 71.33 for colonoscopies (p = 0.92). The mean dose of propofol when infused alone was 84.81 mg whereas in combination with benzodiazepines/opioids was 66.93 mg (p = 0.06). The doses of propofol required were lower for those colonoscopies in which midazolam and/or meperidine was combined and in patients over 65 years of age (p = 0.006 y p = 0.001, respectively). Eleven (10.8%) minor complications were reported, and managed by the own endoscopist. Patients had no memories of the procedure. The tolerance rated by the endoscopist was excellent-good, fair, bad-very bad in 83, 5 and 12% of the gastroscopies and in 79, 8 and 13% of the colonoscopies respectively. Nevertheless bad tolerance did not hinder the completion of the procedure in any case. CONCLUSIONS The administration of propofol by the endoscopist and the assistant nurse, is an effective and safe method of sedation in patients of low and high-risk as well as in elderly patients. The doses of propofol required for an adequate sedation were lower in patients over 65 years of age and for colonoscopies in which medication was combined.</dc:description>
