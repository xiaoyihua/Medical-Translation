<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective was to evaluate the effect of the endoscopic treatment of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a murine model induced with depot estrogen. Three groups with PCOS were studied: group 1 (n = 22) evaluated exclusively using laparoscopy; group 2 (n = 11) one fulguration on both ovaries was performed during laparoscopy; and group 3 (n = 10) three fulgurations were performed. One month after laparoscopy the animal were sacrificed and was carried surgical microscopic examination of the intraabdominal organs, moreover histological evaluation of the gonads was practiced. All the animals showed PCOS. No adhesions were observed in the animals of group 1, while the frequency of adhesion in group 2 was 36.3%, 18.1% of the animals of group 2 showed gonadal atrophy. The frequency of adhesions in the group 3 was 66.6%. The adhesion score was significantly higher in groups 2 and 3 than in group 1. Is concluded that the use of estrogen is useful to induce PCOS in animal models. The procedure can be employed to study the effects of the surgical induction of ovulation, it's utility in other conditions seems promissary.</dc:description>
