<dc:description xml:lang="en">The role played by angiotensin in the development of coronary heart disease is a subject of increasing interest. This interest is due to the results of several trials suggesting that treatment with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors decrease the incidence of clinical manifestations of coronary heart disease. The relationship between angiotensin and coronary heart disease is being analyzed both from basic and clinical approaches. As a result of such investigations, a polymorphism in the angiotensin converting enzyme gene has been described and the role of this polymorphism as a possible risk factor for coronary heart disease has been reported. In this paper the current knowledge about the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene is reviewed and its relationship with coronary heart disease is discussed.</dc:description>
