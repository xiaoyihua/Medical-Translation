<dc:description xml:lang="en">An acardic, acephalic monster is a rare condition occurring once in every 35,000 deliveries. This report details one case occurring in a twin pregnancy in a 19 year old primigravid patient who has spontaneously aborted at 21 weeks gestation. Both twins were males, one of the them weighted 280 g and was acephalic. Autopsy study showed to be also acardic with rudiments of the gastrointestinal tract. The other weighted 350 g and was normal. The placenta was monoamniotic/monochorionic and both umbilical cords had three vessels on gross examination. We think that the scanty literature in Mexico is due to reluctance to report isolated cases like the one we comment here, and depending on local interest in teratology. The salient feature of the pertinent literature, as well as some clinical, radiological and pathogenic considerations are made.</dc:description>
