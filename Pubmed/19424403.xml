<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND Hepatitis C Infection (HCV) is a significant problem in patients treated with chronic hemodialysis in Peru. In prior studies, it has been reported that blood transfusions and time on hemodialysis have been identified as risk factors. PURPOSE Study other probable factors associated with the Hepatitis C virus in a large hemodyalisis center in Lima, Peru. MATERIALS AND METHOD The study consisted of a case model and controls for incident population. A negative case was studied in relation to each case with positive results for HCV antibodies paired by age, sex and origin. Odds ratio (OR) and its confidence interval (CI 95%) were used to assess the degree of association between variables. RESULTS Time on hemodialysis (OR 7.13, CI 95%), 3.04-17.02), more than two hospitalizations (OR 4.49, CI 95%), 1.28-17.28), treatment in multiple dialysis centers (p&lt;0.5), having undergone a transplant (p&lt;0.01) and having received a blood transfusion (OR 2.61 CI 95% 1.04-6.68) were factors associated with HCV. CONCLUSION Permanence on hemodialysis, hospitalizations, receiving dialysis at multiple centers, transplantation and blood transfusions were variables associated with HCV infection in the studied population.</dc:description>
