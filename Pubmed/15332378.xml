<dc:description xml:lang="en">BACKGROUND The National Socioeconomic Characterization Survey (CASEN) was modified in the year 2000, to include an assessment of the inequalities in the access to health services. AIM To analyze the health issues of year 2000 survey database. MATERIAL AND METHODS During 2000, 38338 urban and 26698 rural dwellings were surveyed, totaling 240000 people analyzing ascription to public or private health services and the need demand and use of these services. RESULTS A higher risk population (lower income, higher age and women) is ascribed to public health services. Sixty five percent of the population self perceives their health as good, this figure decreases along with age and women have a worse self perception than men. In the 30 days prior to the survey, 13% of the population had a health related event; this figure was higher among women and the lower income quintiles. Expressed health demand was higher among women and lower income quintiles. A multivariate analysis identified an age below 14 years, pertaining to a minority ethnic group, ascription to private health services, residing in rural areas, pertaining to the lower income quintile and male sex, as factors associated to a lack access to health care. In the adjusted model, pertaining to the National Health Fund (a public system) is a protective factor to receive health services. CONCLUSIONS The significant inequalities in the access to health care should be corrected with the new Health Reform. The new module incorporated to the National Socioeconomic Characterization Survey, is useful to assess the access to health care in Chile.</dc:description>
