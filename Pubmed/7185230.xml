<dc:description xml:lang="en">Sixty four CAH type B patients were studied, they were simultaneously treated with corticosteroids and azathioprine for an average period of 52 months. The patients were classified into two groups: CAH without cirrhosis (45) and CAH with cirrhosis (19). Patients were initially treated with doses of 40 mg prednisone and 50 mg azathioprine. The reduction of steroids was done according to ASAT level; medication being discontinued when there were not signs of activity in liver biopsy. Therapy was readministered due to elevation of ASAT (5 fold) and the liver biopsy shown pattern of CAH. 49% of CAH patients without cirrhosis improve histology and discontinue treatment; half of them had to resume therapy because of relapse. 14% of the patients died (4); three of them belonging to the group who continued taking the drugs. In the CAH group with cirrhosis, 6 were in remission and withdrawn-from treatment, but 5 had to resume it. The mortality rate of this group was of 69% (13), all patients belonging to the group where were not able to discontinue medication. In both groups ASAT was a good parameter of activity. Complications were more frequent in the group with cirrhosis (42%) than in the one without cirrhosis (17%) (p less than 0.01). In patients with CAH type B, the best therapeutic response was associated to those cases without cirrhosis. Mortality rate is high in patients with cirrhosis at onset of therapy.</dc:description>
