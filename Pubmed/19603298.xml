<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Lepra is an uncommon disease within our setting. However, it was considered the most frequent cause of polyneuropathy only 50 years ago. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 37 year-old woman who consulted due to paresthesias in both hands and feet, livedo reticularis and complaints of frequent hand lesions. Examination of the skin detected nodular lesions and the neurophysiological study confirmed distal symmetric sensitive polyneuropathy with axonal predominance. The skin biopsy also showed histocytic infiltrate and mycobacterium lepra type intracytoplasmatic bacilli. This led to the diagnosis of Multibacillary lepromatous leprosy. Multiple treatment was begun, according to the World Health Organization recommendations, with good evolution. In spite of the attempts to eradicate lepra, its incidence continues to be elevated, especially in endemic areas, among which the south of Spain is included. It is generally associated to overcrowding and low social-economic level. CONCLUSIONS This is the last endemic case in the Valencian Community. The possibility of lepra should be considered among the possible causes of sensitive polyneuropathy, above all in patients in endemic areas.</dc:description>
