<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common and aggressive liver and biliary tumour. Hepatic chemoembolisation with doxorubicin-loaded DC Beads(®) is a local therapy for patients with localised nodes, which are not suitable for surgery. The objective of this study is to describe the clinical situations in which this procedure has been used and its early toxicity. METHODS Retrospective descriptive study of patients treated with doxorubicin-loaded DC Beads(®) undergoing hepatic chemoembolisation from October 2006 until July 2009. Data were taken from the Farhos Oncología(®) programme and clinical histories. RESULTS Twenty-two patients were treated during the study period, 15 men and 6 women, with an average age of 66 years. This technique was used for patients diagnosed with unresectable liver cancer. Out of the patient total, 6 were on the liver transplant waiting list. Patients were assessed using the Child-Pugh score: 15 patients in group A, 5 in group B and 1 in group C; and according to Okuda staging system: 14 were in group I, 6 in group II and 1 in group III. The most common toxicity was post-chemoembolisation in 16 patients, which were treated with symptomatic medication. DISCUSSION Using doxorubicin-loaded microspherical DC Beads(®) during transarterial chemoembolisation has been adapted to uses with scientific evidence and tolerated by all patients. Incidences during administration were mild and were resolved with symptomatic medication.</dc:description>
