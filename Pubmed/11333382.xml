<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Headache is the commonest clinical symptom during childhood and adolescence, from a neurologist s point of view. The pathophysiology of migraine and tension headache involve personality and biochemical factors, such as serotonin, which are also common in coeliac disease. OBJECTIVE To establish the prevalence of headache in children and adolescents with coeliac disease, and any possible relation between these conditions. PATIENTS AND METHODS We made a randomized selection of 86 patients with coeliac disease. All were on gluten-free diets and had no current gastroenterological symptoms. They had direct interviews and full physical and neurological examinations. The diagnosis of headache was based on criteria of the International Headache Society in 1988. RESULTS The average age was 12.71 +/- 4.5 years (range 5-24). Headache occurred in 34 (39.5%) of the 86 patients studied. In 18 cases (20.9%) headache was of tension type and in 16 (18.6%) of migraine type. Of the latter, 10 cases had auras and 6 did not. There was no significant sex difference. CONCLUSIONS An increased prevalence of both migraine and tension headaches was observed in the coeliac patients studied as compared with data published in the literature. In the former patients there was also a lower frequency in histories of migraine in first degree family members. This data is probably related to the personality of the patient or to his family or social circumstances in the case of tension headaches. In the case of migraine it may be due to biochemical factors such as a lowered plasma serotonin, seen both in coeliac disease and in migraine.</dc:description>
