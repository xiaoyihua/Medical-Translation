<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION A total of 192 invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, from serotypes 11A, 15B/C and 23A (not included in the conjugated vaccines), were collected in Colombia between 1994 and 2014 as part of the activities of the Network surveillance system for the causative agents of pneumonia and meningitis (SIREVA II). OBJECTIVE To determine the molecular characteristics of invasive S. pneumoniae isolates from serotypes 11A, 15B/C and 23A in Colombia from 1994 to 2014. MATERIALS AND METHODS The molecular characterization of the isolates was carried out through Pulse-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST). RESULTS Serotype 11A showed one clonal group represented by ST62. Serotype 15B/C was composed of three groups associated with Netherlands15B-37 ST199 (28.75%), ST8495 (18.75%), and SLV (Single-Locus Variant) of ST193 (21.25%). Isolates from serotype 23A were gathered in three clonal groups, with 70.21% closely related to ST42, 17.02% to Colombia23F-ST338, and 6.38% to Netherlands15B-37 ST199. CONCLUSION Clones Colombia23F-ST338 and Netherlands15B-ST199 covered more serotypes than those previously found by other authors, including serotype 23A. These analyses reveal the importance of capsular switching in the spreading of successful clones among non-vaccine serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease.</dc:description>
