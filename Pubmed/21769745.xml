<dc:description xml:lang="en">INTRODUCTION Depressive symptoms are fairly common in children and adolescents, these varying according to gender and age. OBJECTIVE The objective of the present study was to examine the prevalence of depressive symptoms based on gender and age in a representative sample of Spanish adolescents. METHOD Severity of depressive symptomatology was assessed using the Reynolds Depression Adolescent Scale (RADS). The final sample was composed of 1,683 nonclinical adolescents, 818 males (48.6%), with a mean age of 15.9 years (SD = 1.2). RESULTS Of the total sample, 2.5% obtained a higher score than the cut-off point of 77 on the RADS, which indicates clear severity in the depressive symptomatology. Statistically significant differences were found as a function of gender and age when the mean scores on the subscales and the RADS total score were compared. Females obtained higher scores than males on the Dysphoria and Somatic Complaints subscales, as well as in the RADS total score. The 17 to 19-year old adolescents group obtained higher scores on the Dysphoria subscale compared to the 14-16 year-old group. CONCLUSIONS Depressive symptoms are a fairly common phenomenon within this age group. These results are consistent with those found in previous literature and have clear implications with a view to understanding this psychological phenomenon in this age group as well as establishing prevention and early detection programs for participants at risk of developing affective disorders.</dc:description>
