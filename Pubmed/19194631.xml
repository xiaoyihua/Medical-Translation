<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cerebral metastasis occur in 20 to 30 percent of patients with systemic cancer and are the most common type of intracranial tumor. The median survival of untreated patients is one month with a slightly longer survival in those treated with steroids. Patients treated with whole brain radiation therapy survive between 3 to 6 months. In selected cases survival can increase to 10 to 12 months with combination of surgery and radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery alone or associated to radiotherapy. Most brain metastasis arise from lung, breast and melanomas. The most important criteria for selecting patients who will benefit from surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery are a Karnofsky score of 70 or more, systemic control of the cancer and absence of leptomeningeal involvement. Surgery is indicated in patients with a single lesion located in an accessible zone and stereotactic radiosurgery is indicated for lesions up to 3 cm of diameter, and in patients with up to 3 or 4 metastasis, no matter their location. The survival benefit of chemotherapy in brain metastasis has not been demonstrated.</dc:description>
