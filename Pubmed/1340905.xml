<dc:description xml:lang="en">Theophylline pharmacokinetics, administered in tablets containing 600 mg in a sustained-release hydrophilic matrix for a once daily intake, was evaluated after being administered to 6 healthy volunteers during 7 days at 8 pm. Plasmatic levels at -2, 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18 and 24 hours in relation with 8 pm intake, were obtained at the 7th day of administration. A plasmatic curve was obtained with a maximum concentration at 12 hours of 10.18 mcg/ml, a minimum concentration of 3.27 mcg/ml and an area under the concentration/time curve of 198.4 mcg.h/ml. These data make it evident that the tablet studied shows a release profile without excessive peaks and an average concentration at steady state within therapeutical range, and suggests its use in asthma.</dc:description>
