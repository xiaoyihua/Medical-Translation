<dc:description xml:lang="es">Introduction. Our objective was to evaluate the riskof stroke or vascular event recurrence in the Spanish populationaccording to the Essen risk scale (ERS) and suggestmodifications to improve its prediction sensitivityand specificity.Methods. Patients in the Real Action Guidelines inStroke Care and Treatment Study (PRACTIC), a prospectiveregistry of stroke patients admitted to 88 Spanishhospitals representing the three level of care, were followed-up for 6 months. Sensitivity and specificity in strokeor vascular event recurrence prediction were determinedwith the ERS and after modifications of this scale.Results. Sensitivity and specificity for stroke recurrenceprediction were 61.5 % and 45.3 % in high-riskpatients (p=0.340), 3.8% and 99.3% in very high riskpatients (p=0.017). Prediction, sensitivity and specificitywere 67.5 % and 46.2 % (p=0.020) or 5% and 99.6%(p=0.017) for any vascular event, respectively. After riskdichotomization, patients scoring &gt;3 points had sensitivityand specificity of 46.2% and 71% (p=0.009) forstroke recurrence and 46.3% and 71.7% for a new vascularevent. These results can be optimized by adding thealcoholism variable to the scale, obtaining a sensitivityand specificity of 51.9% and 67% (p=0.005) or 53.8%and 68% (p=0.0001), respectively. We also reach a higherpredictive power adding alcoholism: 61.2 % (52.9 %-69.5%) vs 56.7% (47.9%-65.6%) for stroke recurrence and 63.7% (57.0%-70.4%) vs 60.5% (53.5%-67.4%) fornew vascular event.Conclusions. ERS has a low sensitivity and predictivepower for stroke or new vascular event in the Spanishpopulation. Dichotomization and adding the variable alcoholismimprove its sensitivity and predictive power forstroke recurrence either for stroke or for any vascular recurrence.However it is still necessary to modify the riskscale to improve identification of the higher risk patients (AU)</dc:description>
