<dc:description xml:lang="en">OBJECTIVES To describe the variables associated with induced abortions in Andalusia (Spain) and the differences between native and foreign populations. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional population-based study was carried out. The files on deliveries and induced abortions were combined to create a single file for the period 2007-2010. A binary logistic regression model was employed. The dependent variable was whether the pregnancy ended in delivery or induced abortion. The independent variables were the year, province of residence, number of previous children, schooling, cohabitation and nationality. The raw and adjusted odds ratios and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated for native and foreign women. RESULTS Of 460,716 pregnancies, 17% ended in an induced abortion and 83% in delivery. The variables most closely associated with the risk of an induced abortion among native and foreign women in Andalusia were having three or more previous children (OR=23.06), being under 25 years old (OR=19.53), living alone (OR=10.04) and being an immigrant (OR=3.95), especially in African women. The rates of abortions, fecundity and fertility were higher in foreigners than in native women, with an increase in abortions and a decrease in fertility and fecundity. CONCLUSIONS The women at greatest risk of having an abortion in Andalusia are young foreign women, especially those from Africa, who live alone, have previous children and secondary education and reside in the province of Huelva.</dc:description>
