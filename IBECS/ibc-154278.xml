<dc:description xml:lang="es">Objective. To determine the presence or absence of sperm in pre ejaculate fluid. Material and methods. A descriptive, cross-sectional study in 25 college male volunteers, aged between 18 and 25 in Barranquilla (Colombia). Each subject was given two slides for making pre-ejaculatory fluid and a container for sampling of seminal fluid; pre-ejaculatory sample was taken first by self-stimulation, and subsequently the sample for semen analysis was collected. Search for sperm in pre-ejaculatory liquid was held in at least 10 fields at ×20 magnification and the two slides. The seminal fluid was processed according to WHO standards. Results. None of the pre-ejaculatory fluids examined had sperm. All study subjects had spermiograms with total count in excess of 100 million sperm mobility greater than 50%; the average pH was 8.2±0.5. Conclusions. Pre-ejaculatory fluid secreted by the glands of Cowper and Littre during sexual stimulation, does not contain sperm and therefore cannot be responsible for pregnancies occurring in the practice of sexual intercourse where the penis is in contact with the external female genitalia or in practice of withdrawal as a contraceptive method (AU)</dc:description>
