<dc:description xml:lang="en">Electrocardiographic findings are analyzed out of a total of 80 exanguinotransfusion done in 70 newborns complaining of hyperbilirubinemia due to isoimmunization to Rh factor, to blood group, to subgroup and to liver enzymatic immaturity. Twenty-six of these babies showed subnormal weights. The technique used was especially that of closed circuit with two vessels and continuous droping. Seventeen patients with concomitant respiratory insuficiency were exanguinated. Electrocardiographic disorders were found in 70% with predominance of hypocalcemia --19 cases--and tachycardia in 9 cases. There were no cases of true hyperkalemia, even in the group of patients who were given blood of over three days of extraction. There were 5 cases of hypokalemia; another 5 with overload in right cavities as possible response to hypervolemia. Disorders of rhythm, bradycardia, ischemia lesions and A-V blockage were present as features of poor prognosis in the only two patients who died in one of whom hyperkalemia and in the other one, hypokalemia were identified. Stress is placed on the greater number of disorders present in the group of infants with subnormal weights, as in those affected with added respiratory insufficiencies or with severe hemolytic diseases.</dc:description>
